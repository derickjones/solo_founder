The beauty of the garden is behind them, and ahead lies a life of toil, sorrow, and separation from God. It feels heavy, doesn’t it? Like a door has slammed shut on paradise. But what if I told you this moment isn’t the tragedy it seems to be? What if this step into the unknown is the very beginning of hope, of growth, and of a path back to God—one that leads to becoming like Him? Today, as we dive into Genesis 3 and 4, and Moses 4 and 5, we’re going to uncover the profound beauty of the Fall, the power of agency, and the redeeming love of Jesus Christ that turns a seeming loss into eternal possibility. Let’s walk this journey together and see what the Lord has to teach us.\n\nLet’s start by setting the scene in the Garden of Eden, where everything is perfect—lush, vibrant, and serene. Adam and Eve are in the presence of God, with no pain, no death, no struggle. But as we read in Genesis 3:1-7 and Moses 4:5-12, Satan enters the picture, tempting Eve with the forbidden fruit, promising that she’ll be like God, knowing good and evil. Eve partakes, Adam follows, and suddenly, their eyes are opened. They feel naked, exposed, and they try to hide from God. The consequences are immediate, as detailed in Genesis 3:16-19 and Moses 4:22-25—sorrow in childbirth for Eve, toil and sweat for Adam, and for both, a life now marked by mortality and separation from their Heavenly Father. It’s a stark shift, and on the surface, it looks like a disaster. But let’s pause to let that resonate. Why would God allow this? Why is this moment, heavy with consequences, actually a crucial part of His plan?\n\nThis is where the restored truths in the Book of Moses shine a light we can’t find anywhere else. In Moses 5:10-11, Adam reflects on the Fall with a perspective that might surprise you. He says, “Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.” Eve echoes this gladness, saying, “Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.” Did you catch that? They’re not mourning their choice—they’re rejoicing in it. They see that leaving Eden opened the door to family, to understanding, and to the joy of redemption through the Savior. This truth leads us to a powerful realization: the Fall wasn’t a mistake to be regretted; it was a necessary step in God’s plan for our growth and ultimate return to Him.\n\nBuilding on that vision, let’s connect this to what Lehi teaches in 2 Nephi 2:22-25. He explains that if Adam and Eve had remained in the Garden, “they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.” Lehi goes on to say, “Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.” Notice how this pattern continues across the scriptures—opposition is essential for progress. Without the Fall, there would be no agency, no choices, no growth. As we read in Moses 4:1-4, agency was so central to God’s plan that Jesus Christ Himself championed it, offering to be our Savior so we could choose freely, while Satan sought to destroy that freedom by forcing obedience. Think about that for a moment. How does knowing that Christ fought for your right to choose deepen your gratitude for Him?\n\nLet’s dive deeper into this idea of agency and opposition. Elder Dale G. Renlund has taught, “Our Heavenly Father’s goal in parenting is not to have His children do what is right; it is to have His children choose to do what is right and ultimately become like Him.” That’s from his talk “Choose You This Day” in the November 2018 Ensign. So, why is choosing so important? As Lehi teaches in 2 Nephi 2:11, “There is an opposition in all things. If not so… righteousness could not be brought to pass.” Opposition gives us the chance to exercise faith, to grow through struggle, and to turn to the Savior when we stumble. Reflect on that for a second. How has facing opposition in your own life helped you come closer to God? Maybe it’s a hard decision, a personal trial, or a moment of repentance—how did choosing to trust the Lord shape who you are becoming?\n\nThis brings us to the heart of the story: Jesus Christ offers hope and redemption from the effects of the Fall. In Moses 5:4-9, we see Adam and Eve after they’ve left Eden, cut off from God’s presence. But they don’t give up. They pray, they offer sacrifices as the Lord commands, and an angel comes to teach them the meaning of those sacrifices. The angel says in Moses 5:8, “This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.” Suddenly, the weight of the Fall is met with the promise of redemption. Through Christ’s Atonement, every effect of the Fall—sin, death, separation from God—can be overcome. Adam and Eve’s response is pure joy, as we’ve already seen in Moses 5:11, where Eve speaks of “the joy of our redemption.” Take a quiet moment. How does knowing that Christ’s sacrifice covers every consequence of the Fall change the way you see your own challenges?\n\nLet’s cross-reference this with other scriptures to see the bigger picture. In Alma 11:42, we learn that because of Christ, “all shall rise from the dead and stand before God, and be judged according to their works.” And in 2 Nephi 2:23, Lehi ties the Fall directly to the Savior’s role, showing that without the Fall, there would be no need for redemption, and without redemption, no eternal life. This pattern of hope weaves through all of scripture—Christ is always the answer. Even in the story of Cain and Abel in Moses 5:16-26, where we see the tragic consequences of rejecting God’s way, the invitation to repent and turn to the Savior remains. The Lord pleads with Cain before his terrible choice, showing that mercy is always extended. How often do you feel the Lord pleading with you to choose Him, even when you’re tempted to go your own way?\n\nNow, let’s explore another layer of this story that often gets misunderstood: the relationship between Adam and Eve. In Genesis 3:16 and Moses 4:22, we read that Adam was to “rule over” Eve. Some have taken this to mean dominance or unkindness, but modern prophets have clarified that this is not the Lord’s intent. As taught in “The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” husbands and wives are to be equal partners in fulfilling their divine roles. Elder Dale G. Renlund and Sister Ruth Lybbert Renlund have explained that a righteous husband will minister to his wife, seek forgiveness, offer praise, and treat her with utmost respect. This is from their book, “The Melchizedek Priesthood: Understanding the Doctrine, Living the Principles.” So, what does it mean to “rule over” in God’s way? It’s about responsibility, protection, and mutual respect—a partnership where both lift each other toward God. Let that truth settle in your heart. How can you apply this principle of equality and love in your own relationships?\n\nAnother beautiful symbol in this story is found in Moses 4:13-16 and 27, where, after Adam and Eve try to cover their nakedness with fig leaves, the Lord Himself clothes them with coats of skins. This act is rich with meaning. In scriptures like Revelation 7:9 and 13-15, clothing often represents purity and covenant protection. The Lord covering Adam and Eve points to His desire to shield us, to cover our sins through the Atonement, and to prepare us to stand in His presence. For those who have received temple endowments, this moment might also remind you of the sacred temple garment and its significance as a reminder of covenants. Ponder that connection. What does it mean to you to be clothed by the Lord, both spiritually and symbolically?\n\nAs we draw to a close, let’s reflect on what we’ve uncovered together. The Fall of Adam and Eve, though marked by hardship, was not a tragedy but a doorway to growth, agency, and redemption. Through their choice, we gained the opportunity to experience opposition, to choose for ourselves, and to rely on Jesus Christ, whose Atonement overcomes every effect of the Fall. Their story teaches us that joy comes not from avoiding struggle, but from embracing God’s plan, trusting in His Son, and offering our own sacrifices with a willing heart, as Adam and Abel did. So, let’s carry these truths into our lives. I invite you to take a moment today to ponder how the Fall has blessed your life—perhaps by writing in your journal about a time when opposition led you closer to Christ. As a family, discuss how you can support each other as equal partners in following the Lord’s plan. And individually, pray to Heavenly Father, as Adam and Eve did in Moses 5:4, asking for His guidance to make choices that align with His will. Let’s honor the Fall not as a loss, but as the beginning of our journey back to Him, made possible through the infinite love of our Savior. Thank you for joining me today, and may these truths inspire you to draw nearer to God.",
