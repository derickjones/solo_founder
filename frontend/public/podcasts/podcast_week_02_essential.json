      "text": "And I'm Sarah. Happy to be here!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Sarah, I’ve got a question that’s been nagging at me. What if I told you there’s something most people miss in Moses 1 that completely reframes how we see ourselves? It’s hidden in just a few words God speaks to Moses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Oh, I’m intrigued, David. I think I know where you’re going with this. It’s in Moses 1:4, where God says, 'Behold, thou art my son.' That simple declaration carries a weight most readers skim over. Let’s unpack why it’s so powerful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Wait, hold on. Just those three words—'thou art my son'—are enough to shift everything? How does that change the way Moses, or even we, see ourselves?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Exactly. From Moses’ perspective, he’s just a man, likely feeling small and unworthy. But from God’s view, he’s a son—a child of divine potential. This isn’t just a title; it’s an identity that contrasts sharply with how Satan later tries to diminish him in Moses 1:12 by saying, 'Moses, son of man, worship me.'"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That’s fascinating. So, we’ve got two perspectives right away—God’s uplifting truth versus Satan’s degrading counterfeit. How does this play out in the rest of Moses’ experience?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "It sets the tone for everything. Notice how God reinforces this identity in Moses 1:6, saying, 'I have a work for thee, Moses, my son.' It’s not just about who Moses is, but what he’s called to do. This pattern of divine identity and purpose echoes across other scriptures too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I’m hooked. What other scriptures show this pattern of identity and purpose? I want to see how this connects."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Let’s trace it. In Abraham 3:22-23, we learn about the premortal spirits, including Abraham, whom God calls 'the noble and great ones.' Then, in our modern day, think of Doctrine and Covenants 11:20, where the Lord tells Hyrum Smith, 'Behold, this is your work, to keep my commandments.' See the thread? From premortal life to ancient prophets to the Restoration, God consistently ties our identity as His children to a divine work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That’s remarkable. So, this isn’t just a one-off with Moses—it’s a pattern across dispensations. But let’s zoom in on the historical context for a moment. What do we know about Moses’ world that makes this declaration even more striking?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Good question. In Moses’ time, around the 13th or 14th century BC, identity was often tied to tribal lineage or social status—think of the Egyptians with their rigid hierarchy and Pharaoh as a god-king. For Moses, raised in Pharaoh’s court but knowing his Hebrew roots, hearing God claim him as 'my son' cuts through all earthly labels. It’s a direct, personal connection to the ultimate source of power and worth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That’s eye-opening. In a world obsessed with status, God’s words must have felt like a lifeline to Moses. It makes me wonder how that helped him face Satan later in the chapter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "It’s everything. In Moses 1:13, when Satan demands worship, Moses responds, 'Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten.' That identity gives him the strength to stand firm. It’s not just a label—it’s his shield."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I never noticed how directly Moses uses that identity as his defense. Let’s circle back to that opening puzzle. How does this declaration of sonship reframe our understanding of ourselves?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Here’s where it gets powerful. When God calls Moses 'my son,' it’s not just personal to him—it’s universal. We’re all children of God, as echoed in Abraham 3:22 where we existed as spirits before the world was. This truth shifts how we see every choice, every challenge, because we’re not just human; we’re divine by nature."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That’s a profound shift. Let’s dig into a hidden connection here. Is there something in these chapters that points to Christ in a way most people overlook?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Absolutely. Notice in Abraham 3:24, it says, 'And there stood one among them that was like unto God.' That’s a reference to the premortal Christ, chosen to be our Savior. What’s striking is how our identity as children of God is tied to His role—He’s the one who makes our divine potential possible through His Atonement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I hadn’t connected those dots before. So, our identity as God’s children is inseparable from Christ’s mission. That’s beautiful. How does this play into God’s ultimate purpose as described in these chapters?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "It’s the heart of it. In Moses 1:39, God declares, 'For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.' Our divine identity isn’t just a starting point; it’s the destination God is working toward through Christ."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That ties everything together. So, how can we apply this ancient truth to our lives today? I’m thinking about the choices we make knowing we’re children of God."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "It changes the lens we use. Every decision—how we treat others, how we face temptation, even how we see ourselves—can be guided by this identity. Like President Nelson taught, knowing who we are affects almost every choice we make. It’s about prioritizing our divine heritage over worldly labels."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That’s so practical. I love how this ancient story speaks directly to us now. Sarah, as we wrap up, what’s one thing you’d invite our listeners to do based on what we’ve discovered?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I’d invite everyone to take a quiet moment this week and reflect on the words, 'I am a child of God.' Look in the mirror, say it to yourself, and ponder what choices you can make to live up to that identity. Let it guide you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That’s a powerful invitation. Thank you, Sarah, for helping us see these scriptures in a new way. We’ll see you all next time on the Come Follow Me Podcast."
