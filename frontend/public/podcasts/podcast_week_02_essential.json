      "text": "And I'm David. Happy to be here!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "David, I’ve got a question that’s been nagging at me. What if I told you that one of the most profound truths about who we are was revealed to Moses in just a single sentence—and most people completely miss its depth?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Oh, I’m intrigued, Sarah. I think I know where you’re going with this. There’s a moment in Moses 1 that absolutely shifts how we see ourselves. Let me set the stage for what’s hidden in plain sight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Wait, don’t give it away just yet! I want our listeners to feel the same anticipation I did. Let’s start by looking at this from different angles. How would Moses himself have understood God’s words in that moment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That’s a great place to begin. In Moses 1:4, God speaks directly to Moses and says, 'Behold, thou art my son.' From Moses’ perspective, as a mortal raised in Egypt, this must have been staggering. He’s being claimed by the Creator of all things as a child of God—his true identity is divine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s powerful. But let’s shift perspectives. How does this same declaration look through the lens of Jesus Christ’s mission?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Through Christ’s view, this identity as children of God is central to His Atonement. He came to ensure we can return to our Heavenly Father, to live out that divine potential. It connects directly to Moses 1:39, where God declares, 'This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.' Christ is the bridge to that eternal life."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I love that connection. Now, let’s trace this idea of divine identity across different dispensations. Does this theme of being children of God show up elsewhere in scripture?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Absolutely, Sarah. It echoes through time. In Abraham 3:22-23, we learn about the premortal existence where God saw the noble and great ones among the spirits, including Abraham, before the world was. This idea of our divine origin is consistent—from Moses, to Abraham, to us today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s fascinating. So, it’s not just Moses hearing this truth—it’s a pattern God wants all of us to understand. What about in the modern restoration? Do we see this reinforced?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "We do. Think about how President Russell M. Nelson emphasizes this in his teachings. In his devotional 'Choices for Eternity,' he says, 'The first thing [the Lord] would make sure you understand is your true identity.' Our identity as children of God shapes every choice we make, just as it did for Moses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s such a clear thread through time. Let’s dive into some historical context to make this even more real. Is there anything from Moses’ world that helps us feel the weight of God’s words to him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Definitely. In ancient Egypt, where Moses was raised, the concept of divine sonship was reserved for pharaohs, who were seen as gods or sons of gods. So when God tells Moses, 'Thou art my son,' in Moses 1:4, it’s a radical redefinition. It’s not just political power—it’s a personal, eternal relationship with the true God."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s a time-collapse moment for me. I can almost feel Moses’ awe hearing that in the context of his upbringing. Now, let’s circle back to that profound truth you hinted at earlier. What’s the sentence most people miss?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Here’s where it gets powerful, Sarah. In Moses 1:6, God says to Moses, 'And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son.' It’s not just about identity—it’s about purpose. God is telling Moses, and by extension all of us, that as His children, we each have a divine work to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I never saw that layered meaning before. It’s not just who we are, but what we’re called to do. That changes how I read this chapter entirely!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Exactly! You just uncovered something profound. And here’s a hidden connection most don’t notice—it ties directly to Abraham 3:25, where God says the purpose of this earth is to 'prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.' Our identity and our work are intertwined across these revelations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s remarkable! So, Moses’ call to a specific work mirrors our broader purpose to be proven faithful. How does this connect to Christ’s role in the plan of salvation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Notice this pattern—Christ is central. In Abraham 3:24, we learn that one among the spirits was 'like unto God,' referring to Jesus Christ, who was chosen to be our Savior. His work was to redeem us, ensuring we can fulfill our divine potential as children of God. It all points back to Him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s such a beautiful connection. I’m seeing how every piece fits into the eternal plan. So, how can we apply this ancient truth to our lives right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Here’s what shifts everything. When we internalize that we are children of God with a divine work to do, it changes how we see every decision. Like President Nelson taught, our identity affects every choice—whether it’s how we treat others or how we resist temptation, as Moses did in Moses 1:12-26."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s so practical. Knowing I’m a child of God gives me strength to face challenges with purpose. It’s not just a title—it’s a call to action."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "You’ve got it, Sarah. So, here’s my invitation to our listeners. Take a moment this week to reflect on Moses 1:4 and Abraham 3:22-23. Ask yourself, 'How does knowing I’m a child of God shape my choices and my work?' Write down one way you can act on that identity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I love that challenge, David. Let’s all take that step to see ourselves as God sees us. Thank you for uncovering these profound truths with us today!"
