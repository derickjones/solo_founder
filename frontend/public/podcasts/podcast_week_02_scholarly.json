      "text": "And I'm David."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "David, I have to start with a mystery that's haunted readers for years. The Bible opens with 'In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth' from Genesis 1:1. But Moses 1 doesn't begin there—what if I told you it starts with a vision that reveals what existed before that 'beginning,' and why God created everything in the first place?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Sarah, you've hit on something profound. The Come Follow Me introduction points out that Moses 1 gives context for the Creation, addressing fundamental questions: Who is God? Who are we? What is God's work, and our place in it? Notice how it frames the entire Old Testament study."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Exactly, and Moses asks the Lord, 'Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens' in Moses 1:36. But before answering that, God declares something about Moses's identity. Wait, what does He say first?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "In Moses 1:4, God says to Moses, 'And thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior.' Then in verse 6, 'And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten.' This sets up a divine identity that Satan immediately challenges."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That's fascinating. So God affirms Moses as a son, like Christ, with a divine work. But hold on—Satan shows up right after this glory-filled vision. What does Satan say in Moses 1:12?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Satan says, 'Moses, son of man, worship me.' It's a counterfeit, stripping away the divine sonship. The Come Follow Me manual highlights this pattern: God declares your true identity as a child of God, while Satan confuses it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "A pattern already. And President Russell M. Nelson taught, 'If the Lord were speaking to you directly, the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity.' So this isn't just ancient—it's for us. But how does Moses respond to Satan's temptation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Moses resists by remembering his divine experience. In verses 13-26, he commands Satan, invoking God's power. Verse 20: 'Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not.' Finally, at the word of God, angels come and cast Satan out. This shows spiritual experiences don't exempt us from temptation—Satan attacks them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I need to understand this deeper. What counterfeits does Satan use, as in Moses 1:13-18? And how can we spot them today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Satan offers fake power and glory, like artificial plants or baby dolls that look real but aren't. He tempts with counterfeits of God's truth. Moses sees through it by relying on the Lord, as in verses 24-26: 'the Lord... called upon God... and the glory of God was upon Moses.'"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Remarkable. Now, after this battle, God shows Moses His works. Moses says in 1:30, 'Tell me... why these things are so.' What's the Lord's response?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Here's where it gets powerful. In Moses 1:39, 'For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.' Immortality is resurrection through Christ; eternal life is exaltation. This ties directly to our premortal origins."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Premortal—leading to Abraham 3. So after identity and God's work, we get the vision of spirits before the world was. David, trace this for me across these chapters."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Absolutely. Abraham 3:22-28 reveals we lived as spirits 'before the world was.' God organized intelligences, chose noble ones like Abraham, Jesus, us—to 'go down... and... prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.'"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That's the plan right there. Notice the pattern: God declares identity to Moses, shows purpose, reveals premortal council in Abraham. But from multiple perspectives—God's to Moses, Abraham's vision, even Satan's counterfeit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Yes, multi-perspective. Ancient Israel's view might see Moses as lawgiver, but Restoration view through JST shows divine sonship. Abraham adds premortal layer. And modern prophets like President Nelson echo: 'The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make.'"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I never saw how tightly these connect. So God's work in Moses 1:39—to bring eternal life—links to Abraham 3:25, where we prove ourselves for eternal truths."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Precisely. Hold that question: how does Christ fit? Abraham 3:24-26 shows the Savior chosen in premortal council to redeem us, making immortality and eternal life possible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Building tension here. Now, for historical context— these are visions like ancient prophets had, but the JST makes them immediate. What cultural insight makes Moses's temptation feel real?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "In ancient Near East, visions often followed glory encounters, with adversarial spirits tempting—like in other seer accounts. But Moses 1 shows the power of invoking Jehovah's name, as angels minister. It feels real because Satan uses familiar tactics: doubt your experience."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That's vivid. Resolving our opening mystery: Moses 1 frames creation because before the beginning was premortal life, God's council, our divine potential."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Exactly! The 'beginning' of Genesis is earth's creation, but Moses 1 and Abraham 3 reveal the premortal 'beginning' of our story. God starts with identity to prepare us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Satisfying. Now hidden connections—compare God's words in Moses 1:4 and 6 with Satan's in 1:12. What shifts everything?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "God: 'similitude of mine Only Begotten,' 'my son.' Satan: 'son of man'—reducing to mortal. Come Follow Me says look for this pattern: God elevates, Satan confuses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "And link to Abraham 3:22: 'These I will make my rulers.' We're noble spirits. Cross-reference to plan of salvation—premortal to proving here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Watch this: Moses 1:39's 'immortality and eternal life' fulfills Abraham 3:26's redemption through Christ. Prophetic echo in Nelson: know your identity to make eternal choices."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Profound. Another connection: Moses resists by prayer and God's name—verses 20-22. Parallels Christ's temptations in Matthew 4."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Spot on. What most people miss: Satan's defeat in Moses 1:26 by 'the power of the Only Begotten' foreshadows temple covenants of protection."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "This changes how I read premortal life. Now modern application: how does Abraham 3:25's 'prove them' apply today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "We prove by choices reflecting identity. Nelson says list choices because you're a child of God first. In daily life, when tempted, recall Moses: 'Who art thou?'"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "For families—Come Follow Me suggests mirror activity: 'I am a child of God' from Moses 1:4. Then compare to Satan's message."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Perfect for children. Act out resisting like Moses—pray, command in Christ's name. Ties to Abraham 3: sing 'I Will Follow God’s Plan.'"

      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "And for deeper study, list truths from Abraham 3:22-28 about self and Christ. Why valuable? Changes how we treat ourselves and others."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "David, trace the pattern further: divine identity across dispensations—Moses, Abraham, Restoration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Moses dispensation: law with identity anchor. Abraham: covenant promise to noble spirits. Restoration: JST reveals it plainly. Modern: prophets urge it as primary identifier."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Pattern recognition mastery. Now contradiction resolution: Powerful vision, yet immediate temptation. Reveals truth: testimony needs constant guarding."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Yes—spiritual highs don't prevent tests. Moses overcomes by truth: 'I am a son of God.' Applies to us resisting counterfeits."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Hebrew insight? 'Similitude' implies likeness to Christ—divine potential."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Exactly, from Latin via JST, but evokes image of God. Abraham 3 adds intelligences organized—eternal progression hint."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Another layer: God's work 1:39 connects to premortal purpose. Worlds without number, yet personal work for each."
