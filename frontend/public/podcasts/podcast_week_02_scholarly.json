      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "And I'm David. Happy to be here!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "David, I’m thrilled to dive into this week’s Come Follow Me material with you. We’re looking at Moses 1 and Abraham 3, which provide such profound insights into our identity and God’s purpose for us. Where do you think we should start?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I’m excited to unpack this too, Sarah. I think a great starting point is Moses 1, where we see this incredible interaction between God and Moses. Right off the bat, in Moses 1:4, the Lord declares, 'Behold, thou art my son.' That sets the tone for everything—our divine identity as children of God. It’s a foundational truth that shapes how we see ourselves and our potential."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I love that. It’s so powerful to hear God affirm Moses’s identity in that way. And it’s not just a personal message to Moses—it applies to all of us. How do you see this idea of divine identity playing out in the rest of Moses 1?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Absolutely, it’s universal. As we move through the chapter, we see a stark contrast in how Satan tries to undermine that identity. In Moses 1:12, Satan comes to Moses and says, 'Moses, son of man, worship me.' Notice how he immediately tries to redefine Moses, stripping away the divine title of 'son of God' and replacing it with 'son of man.' It’s a deliberate attack on identity, which is something we all face in different ways."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s such a keen observation. Satan’s tactic is to make us forget who we really are. I’m struck by how Moses responds to this in verse 13, saying, 'Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten.' How does that response teach us about resisting temptation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "It’s a masterclass in standing firm. Moses doesn’t just reject Satan; he reaffirms his identity and his connection to God. He’s essentially saying, 'I know who I am, and I know who you’re not.' That grounding in divine identity, coupled with his repeated calls for Satan to depart, as we see in verses 16 and 18, shows us that clinging to truth and invoking God’s power are key to overcoming the adversary."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Exactly! And I love how Moses doesn’t just rely on his own strength. In Moses 1:20, it says he 'began to fear,' but he calls upon God and receives strength. It reminds me that we’re not expected to face these battles alone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That’s a critical point, Sarah. And it’s reinforced in verses 24-26, where the Lord returns after Satan is cast out and reassures Moses of His presence and power. It’s a reminder that spiritual experiences don’t immunize us from temptation, but they do prepare us to rely on God when challenges come. Moses’s persistence in prayer and faith is what ultimately helps him prevail."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s beautiful. Let’s pivot a bit to Abraham 3, where we get this remarkable glimpse into our premortal existence. Verses 22-23 talk about the 'intelligences that were organized before the world was' and how the Lord showed Abraham the noble and great ones. What stands out to you about this premortal perspective?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I’m always struck by the eternal nature of our spirits in these verses. Abraham 3:22 says, 'Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones.' It’s a reminder that we’re not just creations of a moment—we have an eternal identity. And then in verse 23, the Lord tells Abraham, 'These I will make my rulers,' pointing to a divine potential and purpose we were prepared for long before mortality."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That idea of purpose is so inspiring. It ties into verse 25, where the Lord explains the purpose of this earth life: 'And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.' How do you interpret this testing or proving process?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I see it as an opportunity for growth through agency. The Hebrew word for 'prove' here can also mean 'to test' or 'to refine,' much like metal is refined through fire. This life is a refining process where our choices shape our character and align us with God’s will—or not. It’s significant that this test was part of the plan from the premortal realm, showing that agency and accountability are central to our progression."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s a powerful image—refining through fire. It makes me think about how our daily decisions, even the small ones, are part of that proving process. Let’s connect this back to Moses 1:39, where the Lord declares, 'For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.' How do these two chapters together help us understand God’s purpose for us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "They really form a complete picture, don’t they? In Moses 1:39, we see God’s ultimate goal—our immortality and eternal life. Immortality is the resurrection, which comes to all through Christ, while eternal life is living with God, which requires our agency and alignment with His will. Then in Abraham 3, we see the premortal foundation of this plan, where we were prepared and chosen for specific roles, and this life becomes the stage where we work out our salvation with Christ’s help."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I love how you tied that together. It’s so clear that God’s work is deeply personal—He’s invested in each of us. How does understanding this premortal context and God’s purpose influence the way we approach challenges in mortality?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "It gives us an eternal perspective, Sarah. Knowing that we existed as spirits before this life, as Abraham 3 teaches, and that God’s glory is tied to our progression, as in Moses 1:39, helps us see trials as temporary and purposeful. Instead of asking, 'Why me?' we can ask, 'What can I learn from this to become more like my Father?' It shifts our focus from mere survival to intentional growth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s such a helpful reframing. I’m also thinking about how this knowledge impacts our sense of worth. When we internalize that we are children of God with divine potential, as President Russell M. Nelson taught in his devotional 'Choices for Eternity,' it can change every decision we make. Have you seen this play out in practical ways?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Definitely. President Nelson’s teaching that 'the way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make' rings so true. For example, when someone truly believes they are a child of God, they’re more likely to make choices aligned with that identity—whether it’s how they treat others, how they handle temptation, or even how they prioritize their time. It becomes a guiding star for behavior and self-respect."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s a beautiful way to put it—a guiding star. It also makes me think about how we can help others see their divine identity. Maybe it’s as simple as affirming someone’s worth in a conversation or teaching our children to see themselves as God sees them, like the activity suggested in the manual with looking in the mirror and saying, 'I am a child of God.'"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I love that idea. And it ties into the broader application of these chapters. When we live with the awareness of our premortal existence and divine destiny, it fosters compassion and patience with others because we recognize they’re on the same eternal journey. It’s not just about us—it’s about helping everyone return to God."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "So true. Building on that, let’s talk about how we can apply these truths in resisting Satan’s counterfeits, as we see in Moses 1. The manual mentions how Satan offers fake versions of God’s truth. What are some modern counterfeits we might encounter, and how can we use Moses’s example to reject them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That’s a great question. Today, Satan’s counterfeits often come in the form of distorted values or identities. For instance, the world might tell us that worth comes from appearance, achievements, or social status, which is a counterfeit of our inherent worth as children of God. Moses’s example in verses 13-18 teaches us to recognize these lies by comparing them to God’s truth, to stand firm in what we know, and to call upon divine help when we feel overwhelmed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s spot on. I also think social media can amplify those counterfeits, making us compare ourselves and feel inadequate. Moses’s repeated reliance on prayer and God’s power, as in verse 20, reminds me that we need to turn to the Lord constantly to keep our perspective clear."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Absolutely. And it’s not just about rejecting the counterfeit—it’s about replacing it with truth. In Moses 1:15, Moses says, 'Blessed be the name of my God, for his Spirit hath not altogether withdrawn from me.' That focus on gratitude and acknowledging God’s presence can anchor us when we’re tempted to believe the adversary’s lies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I love that emphasis on gratitude as a tool. Let’s shift to a deeper doctrinal point. In Abraham 3:24-26, we see the plan of salvation outlined, including the role of Jesus Christ as the Chosen One. How does this deepen our understanding of the Savior’s mission?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "It’s profound, isn’t it? In Abraham 3:24, the Lord says, 'And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.' Then in verse 27, when the question is asked, 'Whom shall I send?' the Savior steps forward with, 'Here am I, send me.' This premortal volunteering shows Christ’s eternal commitment to our salvation—He was central to the plan before the world even existed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s so moving. It highlights how the Atonement wasn’t just a mortal act—it was part of an eternal covenant. How does this perspective help us appreciate the Savior’s role in God’s work and glory as described in Moses 1:39?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "It connects everything. In Moses 1:39, God’s work is to bring about immortality and eternal life, and Christ is the means by which this happens. His premortal choice to be our Redeemer, as seen in Abraham 3, ensures immortality through the resurrection for all, and eternal life for those who choose to follow Him. It’s a partnership between the Father and the Son that centers on us, which is just awe-inspiring."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "It really is. As we start to wrap up, I’m curious—what’s one insight from these chapters that you hope listeners will carry with them this week?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I hope they hold onto the truth of their divine identity from Moses 1:4—'Behold, thou art my son.' That single statement can transform how we see ourselves and others. When we internalize that we are children of God with eternal potential, it gives us strength to resist temptation and purpose to endure trials."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That’s beautiful, David. I’d add that understanding God’s work and glory from Moses 1:39 reminds us that we’re not alone in this journey—God is completely invested in our success. I hope listeners feel that personal connection to Him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I agree completely. And I’d encourage everyone to revisit Abraham 3:22-28 and ponder what it means to have been part of that premortal council. How does that shape the choices you make today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Such a great invitation. I’d also invite our listeners to take a moment this week to pray and ask Heavenly Father to help them see themselves as He sees them. Maybe even spend some time in the temple reflecting on these truths about identity and purpose. It can be a powerful way to feel closer to Him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That’s a wonderful suggestion. And perhaps as part of personal study, write down a list of choices you make because you know you’re a child of God, as President Nelson encouraged. It can help clarify how this identity guides your life."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I love that idea. Well, David, thank you so much for this rich discussion. I’ve learned so much from your insights on Moses 1 and Abraham 3."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Thank you, Sarah. It’s been a joy to explore these chapters together. I hope our listeners feel inspired to dive deeper into these scriptures themselves."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Absolutely. Thanks for joining us on the Come Follow Me Podcast by Gospel Study App. We’ll see you next time for more insights and inspiration."
