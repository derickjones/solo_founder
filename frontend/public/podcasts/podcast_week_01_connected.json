It’s a treasury of stories, laws, and prophecies from a culture so distant, yet so deeply connected to our own spiritual journey. How do you feel as you prepare to step into this sacred text? Are you eager to uncover its truths, or perhaps a bit uncertain about its ancient ways? Today, we’re embarking on an introduction to the Old Testament, and I promise you, within these pages, you’ll find a lamp unto your feet and a light unto your path, just as the psalmist declared in Psalm 119:105.\n\nLet’s start by recognizing why this journey matters. The Old Testament isn’t just a history book; it’s a witness of Jesus Christ, woven through every story, symbol, and prophecy. Think about the manna that sustained the children of Israel in the wilderness, as we read in Exodus 16:4, where the Lord says, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you.” Doesn’t that point directly to Christ, who declared in John 6:35, “I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger”? Or consider the sacrificial lamb of the Passover in Exodus 12:3-5, a lamb without blemish, mirroring John 1:29, where John the Baptist proclaims, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” These aren’t just coincidences; they are divine patterns, inviting us to see the Savior in every corner of this ancient text. Pause for a moment and ask yourself: Where have I already seen Christ in the Old Testament? Maybe it’s the brass serpent lifted up in Numbers 21:8-9, a symbol of healing that Christ Himself references in John 3:14, or Jonah’s three days in the whale, pointing to the Resurrection, as noted in Matthew 12:40. These symbols aren’t just stories—they are testimonies of the Bread of Life.\n\nBuilding on that vision, let’s dive deeper into who is speaking through these pages. Have you ever considered that the voice of the Lord in the Old Testament is often the voice of Jesus Christ Himself? President Dallin H. Oaks has taught us that when we hear the words of “God” or the “Lord” in scripture, they are almost always the words of Jehovah, our risen Lord, Jesus Christ. Think about that for a second. When Jehovah declares His name to Moses in Exodus 3:14 as “I AM THAT I AM,” and Jesus echoes this in John 8:58, saying, “Before Abraham was, I am,” He’s revealing His eternal identity. This shocked the Jews of His day, and no wonder—it’s a profound declaration that the God of the Old Testament is the Savior of the New. Reflect on that connection. How does it change the way you hear Jehovah’s voice as you read? Knowing that Jesus is Jehovah makes every promise, every commandment, and every act of mercy in the Old Testament a direct expression of His love for you.\n\nThis truth leads us to another layer of richness in our study—the restoration of “plain and precious things” through the Prophet Joseph Smith. In 1 Nephi 13:28-29, Nephi saw in vision that many truths would be taken from the Bible over time, but the Lord promised to bring forth other books to restore what was lost. Think about the Book of Moses, which gives us the breathtaking account of Enoch’s city of Zion in Moses 7:18-19, where “the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind.” Or consider Abraham’s vision of the premortal council in Abraham 3:22-23, revealing the noble and great ones chosen before the world was. These restored truths aren’t just fascinating details; they anchor us to the eternal plan of salvation. And as 2 Nephi 3:12 tells us, the Bible and the Book of Mormon together grow “into one,” confounding false doctrines and establishing peace. As you open the Old Testament this year, ask yourself: How do these restored accounts deepen my understanding of God’s plan for me? Let that question linger in your mind.\n\nNotice how this pattern continues in the theme of covenants, a heartbeat of the Old Testament. In Exodus 19:5, the Lord declares, “If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people.” Isn’t that a stunning promise? The Old Testament is the story of God seeking to draw us close through sacred agreements, just as He did with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. President Russell M. Nelson has taught that the everlasting covenant offers a “special kind of love and mercy” that transforms us. As you read, look for moments where God’s covenant love shines through. Maybe it’s in Jeremiah 31:33, where He promises, “I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.” How does that promise resonate with your own covenant relationship with Him? Take a quiet moment to feel the weight of being His peculiar treasure.\n\nLet’s connect these themes to our families, especially our children, because the Old Testament isn’t just for scholars—it’s for every heart seeking Christ. Imagine sitting with your little ones, looking at a painting of Isaiah foretelling Christ’s birth. You point to the baby Jesus in the image and read Isaiah 9:6 together: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” Can you feel the wonder in their eyes as they connect an ancient prophet to their Savior? Or consider reading Psalm 23 with them, lingering on “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want,” and asking, “How does Jesus care for us like a shepherd?” These simple moments plant seeds of faith. And when you talk about covenants, show them a picture of a baptism and read Mosiah 18:10, “Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him?” Help them see that covenants are promises we make with God, just as His people did long ago.\n\nAs we draw this introduction to a close, let’s reflect on what the Old Testament offers us. It’s a lamp, a light, a witness of Jesus Christ as Jehovah, a record of restored truths through Joseph Smith, and a testament of God’s covenant love. Every page invites us to see the Savior’s hand in ancient lives and in our own. Elder Dale G. Renlund has urged us to “remember and always focus on Jesus Christ,” and as we step into this sacred text, that focus will transform our study into a journey of discipleship. So, I invite you to take a personal moment this week to read John 6:35 and ponder how Christ as the Bread of Life sustains you. Then, gather your family and read Isaiah 9:6 together, discussing what those names—Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God—mean to each of you. Finally, write in your journal one symbol of Christ you’ve noticed in the Old Testament already, and commit to looking for Him in every chapter you read this year. Let that truth settle in your heart as we begin this journey together, seeking the Savior in every word and story.",
