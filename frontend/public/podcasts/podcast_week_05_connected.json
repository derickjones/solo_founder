Amidst this setting, a man named Enoch, unsure of himself, hears the voice of God calling him to a work that seems far beyond his reach. “Why is it, that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?” (Moses 6:31). Can you feel the tremble in his voice, the doubt in his heart? Yet, God sees something in Enoch that Enoch cannot see in himself. Today, as we dive into Genesis 5 and Moses 6, we’ll uncover the transformative story of Enoch’s journey, the timeless gospel truths taught from the very beginning, and the invitation for each of us to walk with God, no matter how inadequate we feel.\n\nLet’s start with the sparse account in Genesis 5. It’s mostly a genealogy, a list of names tracing the lineage from Adam to Noah. But tucked into verse 24, we find this mysterious line: “And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.” What does that mean? It’s a fleeting glimpse of something extraordinary, but without more, we’re left wondering. Thankfully, the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, has given us the book of Moses, and in chapter 6, the curtains are pulled back. We see Enoch’s story unfold in vivid detail, revealing not just his remarkable life but profound lessons about God’s power, our potential, and the gospel plan that has been in place since the dawn of time.\n\nPicture Enoch as the Spirit of God finds him, as described in Moses 6:26-27: “And it came to pass that Enoch journeyed in the land, among the people; and as he journeyed, the Spirit of God descended out of heaven, and abode upon him. And he heard a voice from heaven, saying: Enoch, my son, prophesy unto this people, and say unto them—Repent, for thus saith the Lord: I am angry with this people, and my fierce anger is kindled against them; for their hearts have waxed hard, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes cannot see afar off.” Notice the state of the world around Enoch—hearts hardened, ears dull, eyes blind to spiritual truths. Sin has clouded their vision, much as it can cloud ours today. Have you ever felt distant from God, as though your heart couldn’t feel or your ears couldn’t hear His voice? That’s the effect of sin, creating a barrier between us and the divine. But God calls Enoch right into this darkness, not because he’s perfect, but because he’s willing to listen.\n\nNow, let’s linger on Enoch’s response in Moses 6:31, which I quoted earlier. He’s overwhelmed, feeling like a mere lad, slow of speech, and despised by the people. Doesn’t that resonate? How often do we feel unqualified for the tasks God places before us—whether it’s a calling, a family responsibility, or simply striving to live the gospel in a challenging world? But listen to the Lord’s reply in verses 32-34: “And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance… Behold my Spirit is upon thee, wherefore all thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before thee, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I in thee; therefore walk with me.” Pause to let that resonate. God doesn’t dismiss Enoch’s fears; He empowers him through them. This promise to “walk with me” is not just for Enoch—it’s the youth theme for this year, drawn from this very verse. What does it mean to walk with the Savior? It means trusting that His strength will carry us through our weaknesses, just as it did for Enoch.\n\nBuilding on that vision, let’s see how this pattern of divine empowerment repeats across the scriptures. Think of Moses, who felt inadequate to speak before Pharaoh, saying in Exodus 4:10, “O my Lord, I am not eloquent… but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.” Or Jeremiah, who protested in Jeremiah 1:6, “Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.” Even in the Book of Mormon, Nephi lamented in 2 Nephi 33:1, “I, Nephi, cannot write the things which are pleasing unto God and unto men, for when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins.” Yet, in each case, the Lord provided a way—whether through a spokesman like Aaron for Moses, or through the promise of strength for Jeremiah, or through the assurance to Nephi that the Spirit would carry his words. This truth leads us to a powerful realization: God doesn’t call the qualified; He qualifies the called. Reflect on that for a second. Where in your life do you feel inadequate? How might the Lord be waiting to fill your mouth, to justify your words, if you’ll simply go forth as He commands?\n\nNow, let’s turn to the fruits of Enoch’s obedience. In Moses 6:37-39, we see the transformation: “And it came to pass that Enoch went forth in the land, among the people, standing upon the hills and the high places, and cried with a loud voice, testifying against their works; and all men were offended because of him… And it came to pass when they heard him, no man laid hands on him; for fear came on all them that heard him; for he walked with God.” From a place of doubt, Enoch becomes a mighty seer, one who walks so closely with God that His power protects and sustains him. This same promise is echoed later in Moses 7:13, where we read that “so great was the faith of Enoch that he led the people of God, and their enemies came to battle against them; and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled, even according to his command.” Can you see the connection? Walking with God isn’t just a poetic idea—it’s a source of real, tangible strength.\n\nThis brings us to another beautiful theme in Moses 6—the gospel of Jesus Christ, taught from the very beginning. In verses 50-52, the Lord teaches Adam the plan of redemption: “If thou wilt turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice, and believe, and repent of all thy transgressions, and be baptized, even in water, in the name of mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth, which is Jesus Christ, the only name which shall be given under heaven, whereby salvation shall come unto the children of men, ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, asking all things in his name, and whatsoever ye shall ask, it shall be given you.” Isn’t that striking? Long before Christ’s mortal ministry, Adam is taught faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost—the very same principles we hold dear today. Notice how the Lord compares baptism to being born again in verse 59: “That by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death, and inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water, and blood, and the spirit, which I have made, and so became of dust a living soul, even so ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten.” Take a quiet moment to ponder that imagery. Water, blood, and Spirit—symbols of birth and rebirth, pointing us to the Savior’s atoning sacrifice.\n\nThis truth connects seamlessly to the Lord’s command to teach these principles to the rising generation. In Moses 6:58, He declares, “Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto your children, saying: That by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death.” This echoes modern revelation in Doctrine and Covenants 68:25, where the Lord instructs parents, “And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion… that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands… the sin be upon the heads of the parents.” The pattern is clear across dispensations: parents are divinely commissioned to teach the gospel to their children. How are you fulfilling this sacred role, whether as a parent, a mentor, or a friend? What truths do you feel prompted to share with the next generation?\n\nAs we draw to a close, let’s reflect on the invitation woven throughout Moses 6—to walk with God, to trust in His strength, and to teach His gospel. Enoch’s story reminds us that no matter how unqualified we feel, the Lord can make us mighty if we’ll go forth in faith. The gospel principles taught to Adam—faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost—anchor us in a world of hardening hearts and dull ears. And the command to teach these truths ensures that the light of Christ shines through every generation. So, I invite you to ponder these questions in your personal study: Where do I feel inadequate, and how can I trust the Lord to fill my mouth as He did for Enoch? Next, consider as a family how you can create your own “book of remembrance,” as Adam’s family did, perhaps by recording spiritual experiences on FamilySearch.org or in a journal. Finally, take a moment this week to teach or share one gospel truth with someone you love, whether a child, a friend, or a neighbor. Let that truth settle in your heart. As you do, may you feel the Savior walking with you, step by step, just as He did with Enoch.",
