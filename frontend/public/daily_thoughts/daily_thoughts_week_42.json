        "reference": "Isaiah 61:1–2",
        "text": "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;"
      },
      "thought": "This week, we dive into Isaiah 58–66, where the prophet speaks of the Savior’s mission to heal, deliver, and bring light to the world. These chapters remind us that Jesus Christ is the Anointed One who fulfills ancient prophecies, as He declared in a synagogue in Nazareth. We’ll explore themes like fasting, Sabbath observance, and preparing for the Savior’s return. Isaiah’s words also paint a picture of a glorious future with new heavens and a new earth. As we study, let’s reflect on how the Savior’s light guides us today and how we can share it with others. What a privilege to learn of His redeeming love and power!",
      "application": "Take a moment today to write down one way you’ve felt the Savior’s healing or deliverance in your life, and share it with a family member.",
      "question": "How can I more fully turn to the Savior to heal my broken heart or find freedom from my burdens?"

      "title": "Fasting Blesses Others",
      "scripture": {
        "reference": "Isaiah 58:6–7",
        "text": "Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?"
      },
      "thought": "Isaiah teaches us that fasting is more than just going without food—it’s a way to serve and bless others. The Lord invites us to use fasting as a tool to lift burdens, help the oppressed, and care for those in need. When we fast with purpose, coupled with fast offerings, we can help feed the hungry and comfort the poor. This act of service brings spiritual power into our lives and draws us closer to God. Think of President Eyring’s examples of how fast offerings have changed lives. How can we make our fasting a true act of love and service?",
      "application": "Next time you fast, contribute a generous fast offering and pray specifically for someone in need whom it might help.",
      "question": "How have I seen fasting or fast offerings bless someone else’s life?"

      "title": "Sabbath as a Delight",
      "scripture": {
        "reference": "Isaiah 58:13–14",
        "text": "If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it."
      },
      "thought": "Isaiah invites us to see the Sabbath not as a burden, but as a delight—a special day to honor the Lord. By setting aside our own pleasures and focusing on Him, we find joy and spiritual strength. This could mean spending time in prayer, studying scriptures, or serving others instead of pursuing personal hobbies or work. President Russell M. Nelson taught that the Sabbath can truly be a delight when we make it a day of worship. Let’s consider how we can shift our focus on Sundays to delight in the Lord. What small changes could make the Sabbath more meaningful for you and your family?",
      "application": "Create a 'Sabbath delights' box with your family, filling it with ideas for worshipful activities to do together on Sundays.",
      "question": "What is one way I can make the Sabbath more of a delight in my life?"

      },
      "thought": "Isaiah’s words remind us that even in a world covered with darkness, the Lord’s light shines brightly for His people. Jesus Christ is that light, guiding us back to Heavenly Father through His gospel. In the last days, as Isaiah prophesied, this light will gather God’s children from all corners of the earth. We each have a role in reflecting that light to others by living and sharing the gospel. Think about how the Savior’s light has lifted you out of personal darkness. How can you help others see His glory today?",
      "application": "Share a kind word or gospel message with someone who may be struggling, helping them feel the Savior’s light.",
      "question": "How can I be a light to others in a world that often feels dark?"

        "text": "And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him."
      },
      "thought": "Isaiah describes a world in darkness, with no one to intercede—until the Savior steps in with His arm of salvation. Jesus Christ is our Intercessor, standing between us and the consequences of sin, offering redemption through His Atonement. Despite the despair and iniquity around us, as seen in earlier verses of this chapter, His righteousness sustains Him in this role. We can find comfort knowing He fights for us when we feel alone or overwhelmed. Reflect on a time when you’ve felt His saving power in your life. How does knowing He intercedes for you strengthen your faith?",
      "application": "Take a quiet moment today to thank the Savior in prayer for being your Intercessor and Redeemer.",

      },
      "thought": "Isaiah’s vision of the Millennium, when Christ returns, fills us with hope for a time of peace and joy. He describes new heavens and a new earth where past troubles are forgotten, and rejoicing becomes our reality. This prophecy reminds us of the Savior’s promise to return and reign, bringing an end to sorrow. As we prepare for that day, our faith in Him grows stronger, knowing He will make all things right. Imagine the joy of living in a world of righteousness and praise. What can we do now to prepare our hearts for His coming?",
      "application": "Sing or listen to 'When the Savior Comes Again' with your family, discussing one thing you’re excited about for His return.",

      },
      "thought": "As we close this week of studying Isaiah 58–66, let’s remember the Savior’s role as our Redeemer and the source of everlasting light. We’ve learned how fasting and Sabbath worship draw us closer to Him and bless others. Isaiah’s prophecies of Christ’s mission to heal and deliver inspire us to trust in His power. We’ve also looked forward to His return, a day of rejoicing and new beginnings. Reflect on the lovingkindnesses of the Lord in your life, as Isaiah encourages. How have these teachings deepened your desire to follow Him?",
