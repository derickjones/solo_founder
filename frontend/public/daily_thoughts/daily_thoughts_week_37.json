      "title": "Trusting the Lord’s Wisdom",
      "scripture": {
        "reference": "Proverbs 3:5-6",
        "text": "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."
      },
      "thought": "This week, as we dive into Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, we’re invited to seek God’s wisdom and trust in His guidance. Proverbs teaches us that life is better when we rely on the Lord rather than our own limited understanding. Ecclesiastes reminds us that while life can feel temporary and uncertain, true meaning comes from fearing God and keeping His commandments. These books together encourage us to let the Lord direct our paths, even when life feels complicated. As we study, let’s look for ways to trust Him more fully in our daily choices. What will you discover about His wisdom this week?",
      "application": "Take a moment today to write down one area of your life where you can trust the Lord more fully this week.",

        "reference": "Proverbs 1:7",
        "text": "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction."
      },
      "thought": "In Proverbs, we learn that true wisdom starts with a reverence for God—a deep love and respect that guides our actions. This ‘fear of the Lord’ isn’t about being afraid, but about honoring Him and seeking His will in all we do. When we approach life with this mindset, we open ourselves to His knowledge and understanding. Think about how this reverence can shape your decisions today. Whether it’s in school, work, or family life, starting with a desire to follow God sets a strong foundation. How can you show this kind of respect for Him today?",
      "application": "Before making a decision today, pause to pray and ask for God’s guidance to align your choice with His will.",
      "question": "What does it mean to me personally to ‘fear the Lord’ in my daily life?"

        "reference": "Proverbs 15:1",
        "text": "A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger."
      },
      "thought": "Proverbs offers practical advice for how we communicate with others, especially in tense moments. A gentle response can calm a heated situation, while harsh words often make things worse. Think of a time when a kind word from you or someone else changed the tone of a conversation. The Savior often exemplified this principle, responding with patience and love even when challenged. In our homes and online interactions, we can follow His example by choosing words that build up rather than tear down. How can a soft answer make a difference in your relationships today?",
      "application": "When you feel frustrated today, take a deep breath and respond with a kind tone or gentle words.",
      "question": "How have I seen kind words diffuse anger in my life or the lives of others?"

        "text": "Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised."
      },
      "thought": "Proverbs 31 paints a beautiful picture of a virtuous woman whose strength comes from her reverence for the Lord. Her value isn’t in outward appearances but in her spiritual depth and the way she blesses others. This principle applies to all of us—our worth comes from our relationship with God and how we live His teachings. We can emulate her traits of diligence, kindness, and faith in our own lives. Whether you’re a parent, sibling, or friend, your example can inspire others. How can you reflect this kind of virtue today?",
      "application": "Choose one trait of the virtuous woman from Proverbs 31 (like kindness or hard work) and focus on showing it in your actions today.",
      "question": "What qualities of spiritual strength do I admire in others, and how can I develop them in myself?"

        "text": "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man."
      },
      "thought": "Ecclesiastes often highlights the temporary nature of worldly pursuits, calling them ‘vanity.’ Yet, in the end, the Preacher points us to what truly matters: fearing God and keeping His commandments. This gives our lives eternal purpose, even when everything else feels uncertain. No matter the challenges we face, focusing on our duty to God brings clarity and direction. Think about how this perspective can help you prioritize what’s most important. How can you center your life on God’s commandments today?",
      "application": "Set a reminder to read or recite a favorite commandment or scripture today to refocus on your duty to God.",

        "text": "But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day."
      },
      "thought": "Proverbs compares life to a path, and following God’s wisdom lights the way forward. When we choose to obey and trust the Lord, our path becomes brighter, leading us closer to Him. This doesn’t mean life will always be easy, but it promises that His guidance will help us grow. Think of a time when following His direction brought clarity or peace to your life. Even small steps of obedience can illuminate our way. How can you seek His light on your path today?",
      "application": "Take one small step of obedience today, like reading a verse of scripture or saying a heartfelt prayer, to stay on the Lord’s path.",
      "question": "What helps me stay on the path of light when I face difficult choices?"

      "thought": "This week, we’ve explored the wisdom of Proverbs and the reflections of Ecclesiastes, learning that true meaning comes from trusting and fearing the Lord.
