      "thought": "This week, we dive into 2 Kings 16–25, a period of great spiritual struggle for the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Despite widespread idolatry and challenges, we see shining examples of faith in kings like Hezekiah and Josiah, who trusted in the Lord and led their people back to Him. Their stories remind us that even in dark times, we can turn to God for strength and guidance. We’ll explore how their trust in the Lord brought miraculous deliverance and renewed covenants. As we study, let’s consider how we can deepen our own trust in God. What can we learn from these faithful leaders to apply in our lives today?",
      "application": "Set a goal this week to notice moments when you feel God’s guidance as you study these chapters.",

      },
      "thought": "When Hezekiah faced a terrifying threat from the Assyrian army, he didn’t panic or give in to despair. Instead, he took the threatening letter to the house of the Lord and laid it before God in prayer. This act of faith shows us how to turn to the Lord in our most challenging moments. Like Hezekiah, we can bring our fears and worries to Heavenly Father, trusting Him to guide us. His example teaches us that faith isn’t just believing in God’s power, but actively seeking His help. How can we follow Hezekiah’s lead when our faith is tested?",
      "application": "When you feel worried today, take a moment to pray and lay your concerns before the Lord.",

And all the people stood to the covenant."
      },
      "thought": "King Josiah’s covenant to follow the Lord with all his heart and soul was a powerful moment of renewal for Judah. After rediscovering the book of the law, he committed himself and his people to live God’s commandments fully. This whole-souled dedication shows us what it means to truly keep our covenants. Like Josiah, we can show our commitment by aligning our actions with God’s will. His reforms removed idols and restored worship, reminding us to clear distractions from our lives. How can we stand firm in our covenants today?",
      "application": "Choose one covenant you’ve made and think of a specific way to honor it today, like serving someone in need.",

      },
      "thought": "When King Josiah heard the words of the book of the law, he was deeply moved and tore his clothes in sorrow for his people’s sins. This powerful reaction shows his desire to repent and turn back to God. The scriptures awakened in him a need for spiritual reform, leading to significant changes in Judah. Like Josiah, we can let the scriptures touch our hearts and inspire us to change. When we recognize areas in our lives that need improvement, we can act with humility. How have the scriptures prompted you to turn closer to the Lord?",
      "application": "Read a passage of scripture today and write down one way it inspires you to improve.",

      },
      "thought": "When the Assyrian army surrounded Jerusalem, it seemed impossible for Hezekiah’s people to survive. Yet, the Lord sent an angel to deliver them, striking down 185,000 enemy soldiers in one night. This miraculous event reminds us that all things are in the Lord’s hands, no matter how hopeless a situation appears. Like Hezekiah, we can trust that God has the power to save us from our trials. His deliverance may not always look as dramatic, but it is just as real. How has God delivered you in unexpected ways?",

      },
      "thought": "When King Josiah rebuilt the temple, the workers were trusted with money because they dealt faithfully in their duties. Their honesty in small things showed their integrity and commitment to the Lord’s work. This reminds us that obedience in everyday tasks matters to God. Whether it’s being honest in our dealings or fulfilling responsibilities, small acts of faithfulness build trust with God and others. Like these workers, we can show we are trustworthy by doing what’s right, even when no one is watching. How can we be faithful in the small things today?",
      "application": "Choose one small responsibility today and complete it with honesty and care, as if doing it for the Lord.",
