        "text": "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him."
      },
      "thought": "This week, as we dive into the book of Job, we’ll explore the profound question of why bad things happen to good people. Job’s story is one of immense suffering, yet also of unwavering faith in God. Despite losing everything, he declares, 'Yet will I trust in him.' His example teaches us that faith and questions can coexist, even in our darkest moments. As we study, let’s consider how we can hold onto trust in the Lord no matter our circumstances. Job’s journey reminds us that God is always near, even when answers are not clear.",
      "application": "Take a moment today to write down one trial you’re facing and one reason you can trust God through it.",
      "question": "How can trusting in God help me face challenges I don’t fully understand?"

      "scripture": {
        "reference": "Job 1:20-21",
        "text": "Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."
      },
      "thought": "Job’s response to losing everything—his family, wealth, and health—is a powerful testament to faith. Instead of cursing God, he worshipped, acknowledging that all he had was a gift from the Lord. This teaches us that true faith isn’t dependent on our circumstances but on our recognition of God’s sovereignty. In our own lives, we may face unexpected losses or hardships. Job’s example invites us to turn to God in worship, even when we’re hurting. His faith can inspire us to trust that God’s plan is greater than our pain.",
      "application": "When you feel overwhelmed today, pause to say a short prayer of gratitude for something God has given you.",

        "text": "For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God."
      },
      "thought": "In the midst of his suffering, Job proclaimed a powerful truth: he knew his Redeemer lives. This testimony of Jesus Christ gave him hope beyond his current pain, looking forward to a day when he would see God. This reminds us that no matter how dark life gets, Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection offer eternal hope. We, too, can find strength in knowing that our Redeemer is alive and will lift us up. Job’s words encourage us to hold onto this truth during our trials. Let’s anchor our hope in Christ today.",

      "question": "How does knowing that Jesus Christ lives change the way I face my challenges?"

      "scripture": {
        "reference": "Job 2:9-10",
        "text": "Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips."
      },
      "thought": "Job’s response to his wife during intense suffering shows remarkable patience and perspective. Even as he faced unimaginable pain, he refused to curse God, recognizing that both good and bad come from His hand. This teaches us that challenges are part of life, even for the righteous, and not always a sign of punishment. In our own struggles, we can choose to respond with patience rather than bitterness. Job’s example reminds us to trust God’s purposes, even when life feels unfair. Let’s strive to endure with the same steadfastness he showed.",
      "application": "When something frustrating happens today, take a deep breath and silently thank God for His presence in your trial.",

        "reference": "Job 23:10",
        "text": "But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold."
      },
      "thought": "Job understood that God was aware of his path, even in the midst of suffering, and that trials could refine him like gold. This perspective helps us see adversity as a tool for growth rather than just a burden. In our lives, challenges can shape us into stronger, more faithful disciples if we let them. The restored gospel teaches that God’s plan includes trials to help us become like Him. Job’s words remind us to trust that God sees the end result, even when we can’t. Let’s embrace our refining moments with hope.",
      "application": "Reflect on a past trial and write down one way it helped you grow spiritually or emotionally.",

        "text": "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?"
      },
      "thought": "When God finally spoke to Job, He didn’t directly answer why Job suffered, but instead revealed His vast perspective as Creator. Through questions like these, God reminded Job of His infinite wisdom and power over all things. This teaches us that while we may not understand our trials, God sees the whole picture. In our lives, we can find peace by trusting His greater vision, even when answers elude us. Job’s encounter with God invites us to step back and marvel at His creations. Let’s seek His perspective in our own challenges today.",
      "application": "Take a short walk outside today and observe one of God’s creations, reflecting on His power and wisdom.",
      "question": "How can I trust God’s perspective when I don’t understand why certain things happen in my life?"

      },
      "thought": "This week, we’ve journeyed with Job through suffering, questions, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of God. From his unwavering faith to his hope in a living Redeemer, Job showed us how to trust God in all circumstances. We’ve learned that trials refine us, that God’s perspective is greater than ours, and that faith can coexist with unanswered questions. Job’s final testimony of God’s power reminds us that He is in control, even when life feels chaotic. As we close this week, let’s carry forward the resolve to say, 'Yet will I trust in Him.' Our study of Job can strengthen us for whatever lies ahead.",
