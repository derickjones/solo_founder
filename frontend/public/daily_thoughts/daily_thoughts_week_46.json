        "reference": "Daniel 3:28",
        "text": "Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."
      },
      "thought": "This week, we dive into the inspiring stories of Daniel and his friends—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego—who faced immense trials in the Babylonian Empire. Despite being surrounded by a culture that challenged their beliefs, they stood firm in their faith through prayer, obedience, and trust in God. Their examples show us that even in our modern 'Babylon,' we can remain true to our covenants. God worked miracles for them, as seen in this verse when Nebuchadnezzar himself praised their God after witnessing their deliverance. As we study Daniel 1–7, let’s look for ways their courage can inspire us to face our own challenges. How can we trust God to deliver us in our trials?",
      "application": "Take a moment today to identify one area in your life where you feel pressured to compromise your standards, and pray for strength to stand firm.",
      "question": "What can I learn from Daniel and his friends about trusting God in difficult situations?"

      "title": "Standing Firm in Faith",
      "scripture": {
        "reference": "Daniel 3:17-18",
        "text": "If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."
      },
      "thought": "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego faced a life-or-death choice: worship a false idol or trust in God, even if it meant a fiery furnace. Their response in this scripture shows incredible faith—they believed God could save them, but even if He didn’t, they would not compromise. Their example teaches us that true faith isn’t just hoping for miracles; it’s choosing righteousness no matter the outcome. In our lives, we may not face a furnace, but we do encounter pressures to abandon our beliefs. Their story reminds us to trust God’s plan, whether it leads to deliverance now or blessings later. How can their resolve strengthen us in our trials?",
      "application": "Choose one principle or standard you believe in and commit to uphold it today, even if it’s inconvenient or unpopular.",
      "question": "How can I show faith like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego when I face opposition for doing what’s right?"

        "reference": "Daniel 1:8",
        "text": "But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself."
      },
      "thought": "Daniel made a deliberate choice to obey God’s laws, even in captivity, by refusing the king’s food and wine that went against his beliefs. This small act of obedience showed his commitment to God over worldly pressures. His decision led to blessings of health and wisdom, proving that God honors those who honor Him. Today, we might face seemingly small choices—whether to follow the Word of Wisdom, keep the Sabbath holy, or stand for truth. Daniel’s example teaches us that these choices matter and can bring divine strength. How can we purpose in our hearts to obey God?",
      "application": "Make a conscious choice today to follow one of God’s commandments, such as avoiding something harmful to your body or spirit.",
      "question": "What is one small act of obedience I can do today to show my commitment to God?"

      },
      "thought": "When faced with an impossible task—interpreting King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream—Daniel didn’t rely on his own strength; he turned to God in prayer and fasting with his friends. This verse shows that God answered him with a vision, revealing the needed knowledge. Daniel’s response was to praise God, showing gratitude for divine help. We, too, can seek revelation for our challenges, whether big or small, by preparing spiritually through prayer and faith. Daniel’s story reminds us that God is ready to guide us if we humbly ask. What can we do to invite His guidance into our lives?",
      "application": "Set aside a specific time today to pray for guidance on a personal concern or decision, trusting God to answer in His way.",
      "question": "How can I better prepare myself to receive personal revelation from God?"

        "text": "My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt."
      },
      "thought": "Daniel’s faithfulness in prayer led him to the lions’ den, yet he trusted God completely, and God sent an angel to protect him. This verse captures Daniel’s testimony of God’s deliverance, showing that his innocence and obedience were key to his safety. While we may not face literal lions, we do encounter dangers or fears that test our faith. Daniel’s experience teaches us that God is aware of our trials and can provide protection, often in unexpected ways. His story invites us to trust in God’s power to deliver us. How can we lean on Him in our moments of fear?",
      "application": "Identify a fear or challenge you’re facing and pray specifically for God’s protection and peace today.",
      "question": "When have I felt God’s protection in my life, even in small ways?"

        "text": "And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever."
      },
      "thought": "Daniel’s interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream revealed a powerful truth: God’s kingdom will ultimately triumph and endure forever. This verse speaks of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the kingdom set up by God in the latter days, as a stone that will fill the earth. In a world of uncertainty, this prophecy gives us hope that God’s work will prevail. No matter the challenges we face, we can find strength in being part of this eternal kingdom. This hope can guide us to live with purpose and share the gospel with others. How can we contribute to this divine work?",
      "application": "Share a simple testimony or act of kindness today to help spread the influence of God’s kingdom in your circle.",
      "question": "What can I do to help build God’s kingdom in my family or community?"

      },
      "thought": "This week, we’ve learned from Daniel and his friends about standing firm in faith, obeying God in small choices, seeking revelation, trusting in deliverance, and finding hope in God’s eternal kingdom. Their stories in Babylon remind us that we, too, can face our modern challenges with courage and trust in the Lord. This verse from Daniel 7 points to Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, whose kingdom will never be destroyed—a promise that anchors us. Their examples of prayer, obedience, and faith show us practical ways to live as disciples. Let’s carry these lessons forward, knowing God is with us as He was with them. How have their lives inspired you this week?",
      "application": "Reflect on one lesson from this week’s study and write down how you’ll apply it in the coming days.",
      "question": "Which story or principle from Daniel 1–7 has strengthened my faith the most this week?"
