The Old Testament prophets, long before His birth, anticipated His coming with hope and gladness, knowing He would deliver them from captivity and sin. Just as they rejoiced, we too can find joy in the Savior who came to bear our griefs and heal our wounds. Christmas is a time to remember that He is not only the Deliverer of ancient Israel but also the One who saves us personally today. Let’s focus this week on the symbols, titles, and prophecies that point to Christ. As we prepare to study His life in the New Testament next year, may we carry this joy in our hearts.",

      },
      "thought": "The Old Testament is filled with a spirit of eager anticipation for the Messiah, a Deliverer who would bring hope to those in captivity. Isaiah’s words remind us of the Savior’s mission to heal the brokenhearted and free us from the chains of sin. This promise was fulfilled when Jesus was born in Bethlehem, and it continues to be fulfilled in our lives as we turn to Him. During this Christmas week, we can reflect on the hope He brings, no matter our struggles or challenges. His birth was a symbol of renewal, a reminder that better days are ahead. Let’s hold onto that hope as we celebrate His coming.",

In the Old Testament, many symbols pointed to the Savior, such as light, which represents His guidance and strength in our lives.

As we decorate our homes or see Christmas lights this season, we can remember that Christ illuminates our path. These symbols are not just decorations; they are invitations to worship Him. Let’s use them to turn our hearts to the true meaning of Christmas.",

Isaiah 9:6 lists some of these powerful titles, such as Wonderful, Counsellor, and Prince of Peace, reminding us of His roles in our lives. During Christmas, as we sing carols or read scriptures, we can reflect on what these names mean to us personally. Does He feel like a Counsellor when we seek His guidance? Or a Prince of Peace when we find comfort in His presence? Let’s celebrate His identity by recognizing the many ways He blesses us.",
