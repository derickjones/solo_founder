        "text": "Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord."
      },
      "thought": "This week, as we dive into the Psalms, we are invited to center our hearts on praising the Lord. The Psalms, often called 'praises' in Hebrew, remind us of God’s power, mercy, and the countless ways He blesses our lives. From expressions of deep sorrow to triumphant worship, these scriptures show us that praise can take many forms—singing, praying, or sharing testimony. No matter our circumstances, there is always a reason to lift our voices in gratitude. As we study Psalms 102–150, let’s look for personal ways to acknowledge God’s greatness. How will you praise Him this week?",
      "application": "Take a moment today to write down three things you are grateful for about the Lord and share one with a family member or friend.",

        "text": "Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto thee. Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily."
      },
      "thought": "Life can sometimes feel overwhelming, as described in Psalm 102, where the writer expresses feelings of anxiety and isolation. Yet, even in our darkest moments, we can call upon the Lord for comfort. The Psalms teach us that God hears our cries and offers hope when we feel alone. As we turn to Him in prayer, we can find strength to face our challenges. This passage reminds us that God is always near, ready to listen. Let’s trust in His promise to be with us in times of trouble.",
      "application": "Spend a few minutes in prayer today, specifically asking the Lord for comfort in a current challenge you’re facing.",

        "text": "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path."
      },
      "thought": "Psalm 119 beautifully compares our journey through life to walking a path, with God’s word as the light that guides us. Just as a lamp helps us see in the dark, scriptures and prophetic counsel show us the way back to Heavenly Father. When we feel lost or unsure, turning to His word can bring clarity and direction. This verse reminds us that we don’t have to wander aimlessly—God has provided a map for our journey. Let’s commit to seeking His guidance daily. How has His word illuminated your path recently?",
      "application": "Read one verse or short passage from the scriptures today and write down one insight that helps guide your decisions.",
      "question": "In what ways has God’s word helped me find direction during uncertain times?"

        "text": "O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off."
      },
      "thought": "Psalm 139 offers a comforting reminder that God knows us intimately—every thought, action, strength, and weakness. This personal awareness shows His deep love for each of us as individuals. Knowing that He understands even our unspoken feelings can bring peace and confidence in our relationship with Him. It also encourages us to align our choices with His will, since nothing is hidden from Him. Let’s take comfort in being fully known and loved by our Heavenly Father. How does this truth impact the way you live each day?",
      "application": "Reflect on one personal strength or struggle today and thank God in prayer for knowing and loving you as you are.",
      "question": "How does knowing that God understands me completely influence my trust in Him?"

      },
      "thought": "The final psalms, like Psalm 146, are filled with reasons to praise the Lord for His incredible power and goodness. This passage reminds us that God is the Creator of all things and a constant source of help and truth. When we recognize His mighty works, it inspires us to worship and trust in Him above all else. Praising Him can lift our spirits and remind us of His unending care. Let’s take time today to celebrate the ways He has blessed our lives. What mighty works of God have you seen in your own story?",
      "application": "Share with someone today one reason you praise the Lord, whether in person or through a message.",
      "question": "What is one specific thing God has done for me that I can praise Him for today?"

        "text": "The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not."
      },
      "thought": "Psalm 135 warns against trusting in idols—things made by human hands that have no power to help us. In our lives, we might be tempted to rely on material things or worldly solutions instead of turning to God. This scripture reminds us that only the Lord has true power to save and guide us. Unlike lifeless idols, He hears our prayers and acts in our behalf. Let’s examine where we place our trust and recommit to seeking His strength. Where might you need to turn more fully to Him today?",
      "application": "Identify one thing you might be relying on more than God (like technology or personal achievement) and pray for help to trust Him instead.",
      "question": "What ‘idols’ in my life might be distracting me from fully trusting in the Lord?"

        "text": "Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely."
      },
      "thought": "As we conclude this week’s study of the Psalms, let’s reflect on the power of praise in our lives. We’ve seen how God comforts us in trials, lights our path with His word, knows us personally, and deserves our worship over any idol. These scriptures have invited us to call upon Him, trust Him, and celebrate His greatness in all we do. Praising the Lord isn’t just a response to blessings—it’s a way to draw closer to Him. Let’s carry this spirit of gratitude forward. How has praising God changed your perspective this week?",
      "application": "Take time today to sing a hymn or song of praise as a family or individually to express gratitude to God.",
