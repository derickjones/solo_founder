Why did God create? Who is God? Who are we? What is God’s work, and what place do His children hold in it? From Moses's view, these inquiries arise after a divine vision, prompting his plea: “Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens” (Moses 1:36). From God's view, the response reveals purpose amid vast creations. From our view as latter-day readers, Moses 1 and Abraham 3 frame the Old Testament, clarifying identity as children of God against Satan's deceptions. Consider the mystery: God declares to Moses, “thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten” (Moses 1:6), yet Satan counters, “Moses, son of man, worship me” (Moses 1:12). What distinguishes divine truth from counterfeit? God's words affirm eternal worth; Satan's deny it. Another enigma: Visions of worlds without number lead Moses to ask, “why these things are so” (Moses 1:30). The Lord's reply centers on “the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). From Abraham's perspective, premortal councils unveil spirits chosen for earth's proving (Abraham 3:22–28). These layers reveal God's work as enabling divine destiny.\n\n## Scripture Deep Dive\nAscend through key passages, each step unveiling deeper connections.\n\n**Step 1: Divine Identity (Moses 1:4, 6)**. God greets Moses: “my Beloved Son... thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten” (Moses 1:4, 6). This establishes worth beyond mortal frailty.\n\n**Step 2: Satan's Counterfeit (Moses 1:12–13)**. Immediately, “Satan came tempting him, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me” (Moses 1:12). The fake mimics authority but lacks glory.\n\n**Step 3: Rejection Through Testimony (Moses 1:15–20)**. Moses responds, “I will not... I am clean... Get thee hence, Satan” (Moses 1:15–20), invoking prior witness.\n\n**Step 4: Divine Power Restored (Moses 1:24–26)**. “The earth shall shake... and the heavens shall shake” at God's command; Moses sees His face (Moses 1:25–26). Power flows from covenant relationship.\n\n**Step 5: Purpose of Worlds (Moses 1:31–39)**. “Worlds without number have I created... for mine own purpose” (Moses 1:31, 36), culminating in “the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39).\n\n**Step 6: Premortal Council (Abraham 3:22–25)**. “These I will make my rulers... the Gods organized and formed the heavens and the earth” (Abraham 3:22–24); noble spirits, including “one among the midst... mine Only Begotten,” volunteer to prove through agency (Abraham 3:22–27).\n\n**Step 7: Proving and Redemption (Abraham 3:25–28)**. “We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them” (Abraham 3:25). This pattern echoes Moses's resistance, linking premortal choice to mortal trials.\n\n**Step 8: Eternal Framing**. These visions transform Genesis, showing Creation as purposeful for divine heirs.\n\nArchaeological insights from Joseph Smith's translation reveal ancient roots: Moses receives what prophets sought (Moses 1:39, implied in bundle's context of inspired revision).\n\n## Historical Context\nIn the ancient world, creation myths often portrayed gods battling chaos for power. Contrast this with Moses 1 and Abraham 3, restored through Joseph Smith as inspired translation of Genesis 1–6. Moses's vision precedes earthly narrative, providing context absent in Genesis. Abraham's record depicts premortal existence “before the world was” (Abraham 3:22), aligning past councils with mortal probation. This creates time collapse: Pioneers in Nauvoo pondered similar visions amid persecution, mirroring Moses overcoming Satan. Modern readers bridge eras, seeing God's consistent pattern amid worldly counterfeits.\n\n## Pattern Recognition Web\nGod's affirmation—“thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten” (Moses 1:6)—repeats in Abraham 3:22's noble spirits, one being the Only Begotten. Satan's temptation (Moses 1:12) parallels modern deceptions noted in Matthew 4:1–11 (see also bundle). Moses's plea for earth's purpose (Moses 1:36) finds answer in Abraham 3:24–26's earth-making for proving. This web spans dispensations: Premortal council (Abraham 3:22–28) connects to Doctrine and Covenants 11:20's personal work (teaching children section). Vision of worlds (Moses 1:31) echoes in Liahona/For the Strength of Youth emphases on eternal choices. Contradiction resolved: Spiritual highs invite temptation (Moses 1:12–26), but testimony prevails.\n\n## Discussion Framework\n1. What most people miss: How does Moses 1 begin differently from Genesis 1?  \n2. Why might Satan target identity immediately after divine witness (Moses 1:12)?  \n3. Compare God's words (Moses 1:4, 6) and Satan's (Moses 1:12)—what reveals the counterfeit?  \n4. What escalates Moses's resistance (Moses 1:13–26)?  \n5. How does “worlds without number” (Moses 1:33) answer “why these things are so” (Moses 1:30)?  \n6. List premortal truths from Abraham 3:22–28—what changes daily decisions?  \n7. Difference between immortality and eternal life (Moses 1:39; Topics and Questions, “Eternal Life”)?  \n8. How does agency in Abraham 3:25 apply to family choices?  \n9. What proves noble and great spirits (Abraham 3:22–23)?  \n10. How do these visions frame Old Testament reading?\n\n## Gospel Connections\nPrinciples anchor the Plan of Salvation. Premortal life (Abraham 3:22–28) precedes earthly proving, where agency tests obedience (Abraham 3:25). Creation serves “immortality and eternal life” (Moses 1:39), with Jesus Christ enabling both. Identity as God's children (Moses 1:4, 6) withstands temptation, linking to redemption. Surprising parallel: Moses resists post-vision (Moses 1:12–26), as premortal volunteers face mortal counterfeits.\n\n## Teaching Moments\n1. Mirror activity: Children affirm “I am a child of God” from Moses 1:4, contrasting Satan's lie (Moses 1:12).  \n2. Act out resistance: Practice praying, walking away from temptation (Moses 1:13–26).  \n3. Premortal drawing: Illustrate “before the world was” spirits (Abraham 3:22), singing “I Will Follow God’s Plan.”  \n4. Dinner discussion: Share resisting adversary moments, tying to family work (Doctrine and Covenants 11:20).\n\n## Personal Reflection\n- When has doubting identity like Moses faced (Moses 1:12) tested resolve?  \n- List choices flowing from child-of-God truth—what shifts occur?  \n- Recall a “worlds without number” awe moment (Moses 1:33)—how does it center on eternal life?  \n- Identify premortal-like proving in current trials (Abraham 3:25)—what noble potential emerges?\n\n## Prophetic Echoes\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught, “If the Lord were speaking to you directly, the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity” (“Choices for Eternity” [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 2022], Gospel Library). This mirrors God's words to Moses (Moses 1:4, 6). He added, “The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make” (“Choices for Eternity”), echoing premortal truths shaping agency (Abraham 3:22–28). See also Gary E. Stevenson, “Deceive Me Not,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2019, 93–96, for resisting counterfeits.\n\nThese revelations invite recognition of premortal nobility in earthly proving.",
