  "content": "# Come, Follow Me 2026: Week 2 (January 5–11)  \n## Moses 1; Abraham 3  \n*“Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens” (Moses 1:36).*\n\n### Doctrinal Foundation\nFrom Moses's view, the vision begins with awe at God's creations, prompting his plea in Moses 1:36 for deeper understanding of earth, inhabitants, and heavens. From God's view, the response in Moses 1:31–39 reveals His \"work and [His] glory\" centered on bringing \"to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\" From our view as latter-day readers, these chapters frame the entire Old Testament, answering: Who is God? Who are we? What is our place in His work? Consider the mystery setup: Why doesn't Moses begin with \"in the beginning\" like Genesis? It resolves through Joseph's inspired translation, placing Moses's personal encounter first to contextualize Creation. God declares to Moses, \"thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten\" (Moses 1:6, implied in patterns of divine identity), affirming our potential amid Satan's deceptions.\n\n### Scripture Deep Dive\n1. **Moses 1:4, 6**: God affirms Moses's worth against later Satanic doubt—escalating to identity as the foundation for all revelation.  \n2. **Moses 1:12**: Satan counters with \"Moses, son of man,\" mimicking yet twisting God's voice.  \n3. **Moses 1:13–18, 20–22, 26**: Moses resists by commanding in God's name, rejecting counterfeits; pattern peaks as \"the Lord God called upon Moses\" (v. 26). This echoes in Matthew 4:1–11.  \n4. **Moses 1:27–39**: Vision of worlds without number leads to \"why these things are so\" (v. 30), answered by God's glory in eternal life.  \n5. **Abraham 3:22–28**: Premortal council—\"before the world was\"—reveals spirits, intelligence, proving through earth life; Jesus as \"mine Only Begotten\" (v. 22, pattern).  \n6. **Abraham 3:24–26**: Ties to Moses 1:39, showing Christ's role in agency and proving.  \nArchaeological insight from ancient context: Egyptian influences on Abraham's record highlight premortal councils akin to divine assemblies, transforming our view of starry visions as literal heavenly gatherings.\n\n### Historical Context\nJoseph Smith's translation provides \"context for the Creation story,\" revealing what preceded Genesis 1:1—\"before the world was\" (Abraham 3:22). Moses's vision follows his powerful spiritual experience, showing temptation persists post-revelation. Abraham's astronomy ties to ancient Near Eastern star-gazings, but divinely corrected to premortal truths. This creates time collapse: Pioneers like Joseph faced similar Satanic assaults during translation, mirroring Moses resisting amid visions. Modern challenges echo: Satan confuses identity as he did Moses, per the CFM pattern in Moses 1:4, 6 vs. 1:12.\n\n### Pattern Recognition Web\nGod's affirmation in Moses 1:4, 6 repeats across dispensations: Abraham 3:22–28 names premortal nobility; D&C 11:20 calls to God's work. Satan's counterfeit tactic in Moses 1:12–18 links to his post-vision temptations, resolved by invoking God's name (v. 20–26). Premortal proving in Abraham 3:25 connects to Moses 1:39's eternal life purpose. Generational link: Early Saints pondered these via Joseph's revelations, proving amid persecution as Abraham's spirits \"prove themselves\" (Abraham 3:25). Hidden connection: Moses 1:36's earth/heavens query answered in Abraham 3's stars as premortal hosts.\n\n### Discussion Framework\n1. What most people miss: How does Satan's mimicry in Moses 1:12 expose his counterfeit strategy?  \n2. Why did Moses need reminding of his identity post-vision (Moses 1:4, 6)?  \n3. Compare God's response to Moses 1:30—how does Moses 1:31–39 redefine Creation's purpose?  \n4. In Abraham 3:22–28, what truths about yourself and Jesus emerge?  \n5. How does recognizing counterfeits (Moses 1:13–18) help reject modern fakes?  \n6. What's the difference between immortality and eternal life in Moses 1:39?  \n7. How does premortal life (Abraham 3:24–26) answer Moses's request?  \n8. If Satan tempted you post-testimony, what from Moses 1:20–26 builds resistance?  \n9. How does agency in Abraham 3:25–26 frame daily choices?  \n10. Profound application: How does divine identity shift decisions, per prophetic counsel?\n\n### Gospel Connections\nThese principles anchor the Plan of Salvation: Premortal existence (Abraham 3:22–28) leads to mortal proving (Abraham 3:25), fulfilled in Christ's enabling immortality and eternal life (Moses 1:39). Surprising parallel: Moses's resistance prefigures Christ's in Moses 1:24–26, linking to Plan's redemption. Identity as God's child precedes earth life, combating Satan's confusion.\n\n### Teaching Moments\n1. **Mirror Affirmation**: Read Moses 1:4; have family affirm \"I am a child of God\" in mirrors, extending to photos of others—aha moment on universal worth.  \n2. **Act Out Resistance**: Dramatize Moses 1:12–26 (pray, command, invoke God); connect to dinner chats on recent temptations.  \n3. **Premortal Drawings**: Mark Abraham 3:22–28 keywords (\"spirits,\" \"prove\"); draw with \"I Will Follow God’s Plan\"—reveals hidden premortal ties.  \n4. **Work Discussion**: Use Gospel Art Book nos. 13–16 for Moses's work (Moses 1:6); link to D&C 11:20 for ours—generational aha.\n\n### Seminary Synthesis\n1. Teachers adapt Moses 1:12–26 role-play for youth to discover resistance steps (vv. 13, 15, 18, 20–22, 26), building pattern recognition.  \n2. Chart Abraham 3:22–28 truths about self/Jesus, synthesizing premortal council for deeper agency study.  \n3. Contrast Moses 1:4, 6 vs. 1:12 for identity lesson, revealing Satan's post-vision tactic.\n\n### Personal Reflection\n- When has a spiritual high been followed by doubt, like Moses? What from verses 12–26 strengthens you?  \n- List choices flowing from \"child of God\" identity—how does it precede other labels?  \n- In your journey, where do premortal truths (Abraham 3:22–28) inspire proving amid trials?  \nThese patterns invite seeing God's hand uniquely in your path.\n\n### Prophetic Echoes\nPresident Russell M. Nelson mirrors ancient revelation: “If the Lord were speaking to you directly,” he taught, “the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity” (“Choices for Eternity” [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 2022], Gospel Library)—echoing Moses 1:4, 6 against Satan's Moses 1:12. Further, “The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make” aligns with Abraham 3:25's premortal proving, urging identity as primary. Contradiction resolved: Satan confuses post-vision (Moses 1:12); prophets reaffirm divine worth for eternal choices. I cherish how these truths, restored through Joseph, illuminate our premortal promise—He knows us eternally.\n\n*(Word count: 1028)*",
