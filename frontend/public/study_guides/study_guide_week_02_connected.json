From God's view, however, all creation serves a singular purpose: “For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). From our view as latter-day readers, these revelations through Joseph Smith clarify our divine identity amid Satan's confusions. God declares, “Thou art my son” (Moses 1:6), while Satan counters, “Moses, son of man” (Moses 1:12), stripping away eternal lineage. This multi-layered truth resolves the apparent contradiction: if we are merely mortal, temptations overwhelm; but as God's children with premortal nobility (Abraham 3:22–28), we gain power to resist and fulfill our destiny.\n\n## Scripture Deep Dive\n1. **Moses 1:4**: God affirms, “thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior.” This elevates Moses—and us—as reflections of Christ, transforming self-doubt into divine potential.\n\n2. **Moses 1:6**: “Thou art my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands.” Here begins a pattern of identity revelation before cosmic vision, echoed in Abraham 3:22 where spirits are organized “before the world was.”\n\n3. **Moses 1:12**: Satan's counterfeit emerges: “Moses, son of man, worship me.” Contrast this with God's voice, revealing temptation's core tactic—demoting divine sonship.\n\n4. **Moses 1:13–18**: Moses resists by recalling God's words: “I will not cease to call upon God” (Moses 1:20). This builds to verse 26, where “the glory of God was upon Moses” drives Satan away, paralleling Christ's triumph (see Matthew 4:1–11, referenced in CFM).\n\n5. **Moses 1:31–39**: After beholding worlds, Moses asks, “why these things are so” (Moses 1:30). God's reply culminates: “this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39), linking creation to exaltation.\n\n6. **Abraham 3:24–26**: “We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.” This premortal council reveals agency as the test for eternal life.\n\n7. **Abraham 3:22–28**: Spirits “organized before they were placed upon the earth” include “one among the souls... like unto God,” identifying Christ. This pattern escalates from Moses's personal vision to Abraham's panoramic premortal assembly.\n\nThese passages create a web: personal identity (Moses 1:4–6) → resistance (1:12–26) → purpose (1:39; Abraham 3:25), with archaeological echoes of ancient councils in Egyptian texts aligning with restored truths.\n\n## Historical Context\nThrough Joseph Smith's inspired translation, Moses 1 precedes Genesis, providing the prophet's visionary prologue absent in the Bible. Abraham 3 unveils premortal councils unknown to ancient scribes, yet hinted in pseudepigrapha. In Moses's era, Egyptian influences tempted idolatry, mirroring Satan's worship demand (Moses 1:12). Abraham faced priestly oppressions in Ur, prompting his vision of eternal order (Abraham 3). These \"time collapse moments\" align ancient Near Eastern star-gazing (Abraham 3:2–4) with modern telescopes, affirming God's organized intelligence: \"the Gods watched those things... organized\" (Abraham 3:12, implied in CFM vision emphasis).\n\n## Pattern Recognition Web\nThis week's truths weave across dispensations: Moses's resistance (Moses 1:20–26) mirrors Christ's wilderness victory (Matthew 4:1–11); premortal proving (Abraham 3:25) echoes Lehi's council vision (implied in Topics, “Premortal Life”); God's work (Moses 1:39) fulfills D&C 11:20's call to “thy work.” Satan’s demotion tactic repeats in latter-day counterfeits, as President Nelson notes: Satan confuses identity where God clarifies it (Moses 1:4, 6 vs. 1:12). Generational link: Pioneers, like Moses, endured visions amid opposition, proving faithful (Saints vol. 2, ch. 12 pattern in prophetic echoes).\n\n## Discussion Framework\n1. What most people miss: Why does Moses 1 begin before Genesis—how does it frame Creation?\n2. God's message: “Thou art my son” (Moses 1:6)—how does this differ from Satan's “son of man” (Moses 1:12)?\n3. Counterfeits: Like fake plants, what modern temptations mimic God's power (Moses 1:13–18)?\n4. Resistance keys: What sequence helped Moses overcome (verses 13, 15, 18, 20–22, 26)?\n5. Mystery setup: Why create worlds? Resolve with Moses 1:39.\n6. Premortal list: Truths from Abraham 3:22–28 about self and Christ?\n7. Proving ground: How does Abraham 3:25 apply to daily choices?\n8. Identity impact: “The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision” (President Nelson, “Choices for Eternity”)—list examples.\n9. Eternal life: Difference from immortality, per Moses 1:39?\n10. Application: How does Christ enable both (Topics, “Eternal Life”)?\n\n## Gospel Connections\nThese chapters anchor the Plan of Salvation: Premortal spirits (Abraham 3:22–28) → mortal proving (3:25) → immortality via Resurrection, eternal life through obedience (Moses 1:39). Parallels surprise: Moses beholds worlds as Abraham organizes intelligences, both pointing to Christ's role as Savior (Moses 1:6; Abraham 3:22). Agency in premortal council (Abraham 3:26) connects to earthly tests, with Christ overcoming where we falter (Moses 1:24–26).\n\n## Teaching Moments\n1. **Mirror activity**: Read Moses 1:4; have family affirm in mirrors, “I am a child of God,” then extend to photos: “This is a child of God”—sparking treatment changes.\n2. **Act-out resistance**: Dramatize Moses 1:12–26 (pray, command in Christ's name)—fun for kids, profound aha on glory's power (Moses 1:26).\n3. **Premortal draw**: Mark Abraham 3:22–28 phrases (“before the world was,” “prove”); draw spirits choosing—tie to “I Will Follow God’s Plan” song.\n4. **Dinner chat**: Share resisting Satan stories, linking to Moses—spontaneous, per Teaching in the Savior’s Way.\n\n## Seminary Synthesis\n1. Seminary teachers adapt Moses 1:36's question (“tell me concerning this earth”) for student journals: List personal “why these things?” leading to 1:39's purpose.\n2. Highlight Abraham 3:22–28 council as pattern for D&C 11:20 work—group timelines connect premortal to pioneer missions.\n3. Use Moses 1:12 counterfeit contrast for role-plays, revealing deeper truth in identity battles.\n\n## Personal Reflection\n- When has doubting your divine son- or daughtership tempted you like Moses 1:12? What recalled God's words?\n- List choices flowing from “child of God” over other labels—how does this match President Nelson's counsel?\n- In what earth situations must you “prove” (Abraham 3:25)? How has Christ helped past wrong choices?\n- Trace patterns: A vision or prompting followed by temptation—how did glory come, as in Moses 1:26?\n\n## Prophetic Echoes\nPresident Nelson mirrors Moses: “If the Lord were speaking to you directly... the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity” (“Choices for Eternity”), echoing “Thou art my son” (Moses 1:6). Satan confuses this, per Moses 1:12, as Nelson warns. “The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make” parallels Abraham 3:25's premortal charge, urging choices for eternity. These devotional words revive ancient visions, as Joseph Smith's translations answer Moses's plea (Moses 1:36).\n\nI bear testimony that pondering these revelations has drawn me nearer to the Savior, whose light scatters shadows every time.
