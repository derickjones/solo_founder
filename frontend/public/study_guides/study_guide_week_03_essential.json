Yet from this chaos, Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ formed a world of beauty and majesty. Notice this quiet, powerful detail: “By mine Only Begotten I created these things.” Their work shows how God transforms the unorganized into the magnificent—filling emptiness with life, just as They continue creating within each soul toward divine potential.\n\n## Key Scripture Moments\nHere's the remarkable moment when creation unfolds: Genesis 1:1–25; Moses 2:1–25; Abraham 4:1–25 reveal God teaching through organized periods, culminating in life from the waters and earth.\n\nNotice what happens next in Genesis 1:26–27; Moses 2:26–27; Abraham 4:26–27: “God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” Male and female emerge as God's highest creation.\n\nThen comes the charge in Genesis 1:28; Moses 2:28; Abraham 4:28: “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing.”\n\nFinally, Genesis 2:2–3; Moses 3:2–3; Abraham 5:2–3 declare the seventh day “blessed” and “sanctified,” a holy pause amid the work.\n\n## Hidden Connections\nThese verses link across accounts—Genesis, Moses, Abraham—showing identical patterns in creation's order, from light to man. Genesis 1:28; Moses 2:28; Abraham 4:28 connect to Doctrine and Covenants 59:16–21 and 104:13–18, expanding dominion as grateful stewardship over earth's abundance. Genesis 1:26–27 ties to Mosiah 3:19 and Ether 12:27, countering ideas that divine image excuses weakness; instead, it calls for overcoming through Christ. Marriage in Genesis 2:18–25; Moses 3:18, 21–24; Abraham 5:14–18 echoes “Adam and Eve were joined together in marriage for time and for all eternity by the power of [the] everlasting priesthood” (Russell M. Nelson, “Lessons from Eve,” Ensign, Nov. 1987, 87).\n\n## Pattern Discovery\nNotice this pattern repeating across prophets: Moses restores Genesis's details, Abraham reveals premortal Gods organizing; all emphasize Jesus as active Creator under the Father. From void to Sabbath rest, creation builds progressively—light, firmament, life, man, then holy day—mirroring personal transformation from chaos to exalted likeness.\n\n## Simple Questions\n1. What does God teach about creation in Genesis 1:1–25; Moses 2:1–25; Abraham 4:1–25? Why reveal these things now?  \n2. Ponder Genesis 1:26–27; Moses 2:26–27; Abraham 4:26–27: How does being created in God’s image affect views of self, others, and Him?  \n3. When negative feelings arise, how do these image-of-God truths help? Complete: “Because I know I am created in God’s image, I choose to…”  \n4. What do Genesis 1:28; Moses 2:28; Abraham 4:28 suggest about responsibility toward creations?  \n5. In Genesis 2:2–3; Moses 3:2–3; Abraham 5:2–3, what makes the Sabbath “blessed” to you?  \n6. How can treating marriage with sacredness honor Genesis 1:27–28; 2:18–25; Moses 3:18, 21–24; Abraham 5:14–18?\n\n## One Big Idea\nGod and Jesus Christ create magnificence from the unorganized, crowning humanity in Their image with eternal potential (Genesis 1:26). This Pearl of Great Price restoration clarifies Genesis, showing premortal council and ongoing divine work, transforming chaos into glorified beings.\n\n## Living It\nTake children outside to search creations from each period (Old Testament Stories, 8–12), then sing “My Heavenly Father Loves Me” (Children’s Songbook, 228–29) to feel His love. Draw bodies as puzzles, discussing thanks for sacred forms while reviewing “Your body is sacred” (For the Strength of Youth, pages 22–29). Role-play Sabbath choices using Genesis 2:2–3, making it holy through worship distinct from other days. Care for earth per Genesis 1:28; Doctrine and Covenants 59:16–21.\n\n## Faith Builder\nRecent guidance echoes these truths: In “God’s Greatest Creation” (Gospel Library), President Russell M. Nelson testifies of the miraculous human body. See also Gérald Caussé, “Our Earthly Stewardship,” Liahona, Nov. 2022, 57–59; Russell M. Nelson, “Your Body: A Magnificent Gift to Cherish,” Liahona, Aug. 2019, 50–55.\n\nThese Creation accounts invite deeper reverence for bodies, marriages, and stewardship as part of becoming like exalted Creators through Jesus Christ.",
