This week's intro to the Old Testament isn't dusty history; it's a treasure hunt for Jesus Christ hidden in symbols like manna and lambs, showing He's been directing your life since forever (Psalm 119:105: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path”). Get pumped—it's your guide for epic faith in a chaotic world!\n\n## Core Truths\n1. **Old Testament Testifies of Jesus Christ**: Spot Him as the Bread of Life in manna (Exodus 16:4, 11–15; John 6:35, “I am the bread of life”), the sacrificial lamb (Exodus 12:3–5; John 1:29), brass serpent (Numbers 21:4–10; John 3:14), and Jonah (Jonah 1:4–17; Matthew 12:38–41). These teach He's our Savior—ties to For the Strength of Youth: Stand strong by focusing on Him daily.\n   \n2. **Jesus Christ is Jehovah**: He's the God of the Old Testament! “The scriptural records of words spoken by ‘God’ or the ‘Lord’ are almost always the words of Jehovah, our risen Lord, Jesus Christ” (President Dallin H. Oaks, “The Teachings of Jesus Christ,” Liahona, May 2023, 102). Check Exodus 3:13–15; 6:3–5—why it shocked folks when He said, “Before Abraham was, I am” (John 8:58).\n\n3. **Restored Plain and Precious Things**: God fixed missing truths via Joseph Smith—like Enoch’s Zion (Moses 7:18–19), Abraham’s council vision (Abraham 3:22–28), and Melchizedek’s ministry (JST, Genesis 14:25–40). Nephi saw it: “many plain and precious things” restored (1 Nephi 13:21–29, 38–42).\n\n4. **Covenants Make Us God's Treasure**: Old Testament is God making us His “peculiar treasure” by covenant (Exodus 19:5). “All things have their likeness, and all things are created and made to bear record of me” (Moses 6:63)—links to For the Strength of Youth on honoring promises.\n\n5. **Focus on Christ Like Elder Renlund Says**: “Remember and always focus on Jesus Christ” (Elder Dale G. Renlund, “Jesus Christ Is the Treasure,” Liahona, Nov. 2023, 98).\n\n## Daily Dive\n**Day 1**: Read intro + Psalm 119:105,140. Journal: How's the Old Testament like a phone flashlight in dark hallways at school? Text a friend your fave symbol of Christ.\n\n**Day 2**: Exodus 16:4,11–15 + John 6:35. Meme it: Create a \"Manna Monday\" pic—how does Jesus feed your spiritual hunger during finals?\n\n**Day 3**: Exodus 12:3–5 + John 1:29. Quick vid: Watch \"Seek the Lord Early\" (Children’s Songbook, 108). Question: When have friends pressured you—what lamb-like sacrifice helped?\n\n**Day 4**: Numbers 21:4–10 + John 3:14; Jonah 1:4–17. Group text chain: Share an OT Christ symbol and tie to peer pressure at lunch.\n\n**Day 5**: Exodus 3:13–15; 6:3–5 + Oaks quote. Pray: Why's knowing Jesus is Jehovah a game-changer for your testimony?\n\n**Day 6**: 1 Nephi 13:21–29,38–42 + Moses 7:18–19. Note: How do restored stories pump you for missionary prep?\n\n**Day 7**: Nelson’s “The Everlasting Covenant” (Liahona, Oct. 2022, 4–11) + Exodus 19:5. Reflect: What covenant promise excites you for future goals like college or missions?\n\n## Activity Ideas\n1. **Symbol Scavenger Hunt**: Teams hunt OT Christ symbols (manna, lamb, etc.) in Guide to the Scriptures. Winner gets candy—then share why they testify of Him.\n   \n2. **Jehovah Role-Play**: Act out Exodus 3:13–15 skit—add modern twist like Jesus as your squad leader. Discuss Oaks quote.\n\n3. **Covenant Promise Chain**: Link paper strips with personal covenants (baptism pic from Mosiah 18:10,13). Sing “When I Am Baptized” (CS, 103)—build a class chain!\n\n4. **Restored Truths Video Jam**: Watch clips on Book of Moses/Abraham (Gospel Library). Meme restored stories vs. plain Bible—laugh and testify.\n\n5. **Lamp Unto My Feet Jam Session**: Blast Youth Music album track like a Psalm 119 remix. Dance/draw how scriptures light your path.\n\n## Real-Life Connections\nCrush social media scroll with Christ symbols—post an OT meme instead of drama (John 6:35 feeds better than likes). Beat peer pressure by remembering Jehovah's your real boss (Exodus 6:3). Prep for missions: Covenants = your superpower (Exodus 19:5)—study restored truths to share plain and precious gems with friends doubting online.\n\n## Faith Boost\nYouth, the Old Testament isn't ancient—it's your 2026 power-up, packed with Jesus proofs and covenant vibes that light your path (Psalm 119:105). I know He's Jehovah because these symbols hit my heart every time. Share in class: One truth that strengthened your testimony this week. Challenge: Pick one symbol or covenant, apply it today—like journaling how manna shows up in your lunch-hour faith—and watch God move! 🚀 (748 words)",
