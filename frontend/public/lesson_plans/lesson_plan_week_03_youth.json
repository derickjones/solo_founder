One thing the Creation story teaches us is that God can, over time, make something magnificent out of something unorganized.\"* (Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026)  \n\n**Preparation for Teachers**: Gather devices for videos (“God’s Greatest Creation” and “The Sabbath Is a Delight” in Gospel Library), paper/markers for activities, and printouts of key verses. Aim for 45-60 minutes. Encourage youth to reference For the Strength of Youth (YSA edition or standard).  \n\n## Attention Grabber (5 minutes)  \nPicture your Instagram feed or Snapchat stories when they're a total mess—endless scrolls of chaos, negativity, or just random stuff piling up. Now imagine Heavenly Father and Jesus stepping in, organizing it all into something epic that points you toward light and purpose. That's like the Creation: the earth started \"without form, and void\" (Genesis 1:2), totally chaotic, but God turned it into this stunning world. How does knowing Creators are still at work in *your* messy moments—like school stress or friend drama—change things? Share one \"chaos\" from your week.  \n\n## Core Doctrines (10 minutes)  \nBreak into these truths straight from the scriptures—post them on the board with references.  \n\n1. **Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are Creators**: \"By mine Only Begotten I created these things\" (Moses 2:1, implied in Genesis 1:1–25; Moses 2:1–25; Abraham 4:1–25). Jesus organized the earth from chaos into beauty, teaching us God can fill emptiness with life (Come, Follow Me).  \n\n2. **We are created in God's image**: \"And I, God, said unto mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning: Let us make man in our image, after our likeness... And I, God, created man in mine own image, in the image of mine Only Begotten\" (Moses 2:26–27; see also Genesis 1:26–27; Abraham 4:26–27). This means divine potential—your body is \"a magnificent gift to cherish\" (Russell M. Nelson, “Your Body: A Magnificent Gift to Cherish,” Liahona, Aug. 2019).  \n\n3. **Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God**: God created male and female, joined Adam and Eve eternally: \"Adam and Eve were joined together in marriage for time and for all eternity by the power of [the] everlasting priesthood\" (Russell M. Nelson, “Lessons from Eve,” Ensign, Nov. 1987, 87; Genesis 1:27–28; 2:18–25; Moses 3:18, 21–24; Abraham 5:14–18). See “The Family: A Proclamation to the World.”  \n\n4. **We are stewards over God's creations**: \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over... every living thing that moveth upon the earth\" (Genesis 1:28; Moses 2:28; Abraham 4:28). Care includes gratitude: \"All things which come of the earth... are made for the benefit and the use of man... to please the eye... gladden the heart\" (Doctrine and Covenants 59:16–21).  \n\n5. **God sanctified the Sabbath**: \"And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested... And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it\" (Genesis 2:2–3; Moses 3:2–3; Abraham 5:2–3).  \n\nConnect to For the Strength of Youth: \"Your body is sacred\" (pages 22–29).  \n\n## Interactive Activities (20-25 minutes)  \n**Activity 1: Video and \"Because I Am in God's Image\" Journal (10 minutes)**  \nWatch “God’s Greatest Creation” (Gospel Library, President Nelson). Ask: \"How does Heavenly Father want me to feel about my body?\" (Come, Follow Me). Youth complete: “Because I know I am created in God’s image (Moses 2:26–27), I choose to…” (e.g., treat my body with respect amid social media filters). Share 1-2 responses. Counter false ideas with: \"For the natural man is an enemy to God... unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit\" (Mosiah 3:19).  \n\n**Activity 2: Small Group Stewardship Challenges (10 minutes)**  \nGroups of 3-4 discuss: What does \"have dominion\" (Genesis 1:28) look like today—recycling, appreciating nature, or avoiding waste? Read Doctrine and Covenants 104:13–18. Report back one actionable idea, like \"post a pic of God's creations with your testimony\" while listening to “All Creatures of Our God and King” (Hymns, no. 62).  \n\n**Activity 3: Role-Play Sabbath Dilemmas (Optional Quick-Hit, 5 minutes)**  \n\"Would you rather: Scroll TikTok all Sunday or serve at a ward activity?\" Role-play explaining choices using Genesis 2:2–3 and “The Sabbath Is a Delight” video clip.  \n\n## Real-Life Application (5 minutes)  \n- **Body Image/Peer Pressure**: When filters or comments hit hard, remember you're in God's image (Genesis 1:26–27)—choose standards from For the Strength of Youth over trends.  \n- **Social Media/School Chaos**: Let Creators organize your \"void\" moments, like study stress, by pondering Creation outside (Come, Follow Me).  \n- **Dating/Future Goals**: Honor eternal marriage by treating relationships sacredly now (Genesis 2:18–25). Prep for missions/families with stewardship mindset.  \n- **Sabbath in a Busy World**: Make Sunday \"a delight\" (Isaiah 58:13, via video)—no sports over service?  \n- **Environmental Pressures**: Care for earth amid climate talks (Gérald Caussé, “Our Earthly Stewardship,” Liahona, Nov. 2022).  \n\n## Testimony Moment (5 minutes)  \nAs we study these accounts, feel the reverence for Heavenly Father and Jesus as Creators—They see your divine spark and are organizing your life too (Genesis 1:26). I know this because the Spirit has witnessed it through scriptures like Moses 2:26–27. Share one feeling or insight this brings you. **Challenge**: This week, do one thing from your \"Because I Am...\" sentence or stewardship idea—like a nature walk thanking God or a sacred Sabbath choice. Text me or a friend your experience. Let's see God make magnificence from our chaos. (748 words)",
