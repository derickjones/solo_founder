That’s helpful to remember when life seems chaotic. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are Creators, and Their creative work with us is not finished.\"* (Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026)\n\n## Attention Grabber (5 minutes)\nPicture this: Your backpack is exploded all over your bedroom floor—books, clothes, snack wrappers everywhere. Total chaos. But then you spend a couple hours organizing it, and boom—it's functional, even kinda awesome. Now imagine God starting with an earth that was “without form, and void” and “empty and desolate” (Genesis 1:2; Abraham 4:2). How does knowing Heavenly Father and Jesus turned that mess into our epic world change how you see your own chaotic days—like finals week or friend drama? Share one \"chaotic\" thing in your life right now.\n\n## Core Doctrines (10 minutes)\nHere are 5 key truths from this week's scriptures, straight-up for you:\n\n1. **Jesus Christ created the world under Heavenly Father's direction.** \"By mine Only Begotten I created these things\" (implied in Genesis 1:1–25; Moses 2:1–25; Abraham 4:1–25). These accounts show God's power and order—light from darkness, seas, animals, everything with purpose.\n\n2. **You are created in God's image—male and female—with divine potential.** \"God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness... So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them\" (Genesis 1:26–27; Moses 2:26–27; Abraham 4:26–27). This means your body is \"sacred\" (For the Strength of Youth, pages 22–29).\n\n3. **Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God.** \"Adam and Eve were joined together in marriage for time and for all eternity by the power of [the] everlasting priesthood\" (Russell M. Nelson, “Lessons from Eve,” Ensign, Nov. 1987, 87; see Genesis 1:27–28; 2:18–25; Moses 3:18, 21–24; Abraham 5:14–18).\n\n4. **We are responsible to care for God's creations.** \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over... every living thing\" (Genesis 1:28; Moses 2:28; Abraham 4:28; see D&C 59:16–21; 104:13–18).\n\n5. **God blessed the Sabbath day as holy.** \"And on the seventh day God ended his work... and he rested... And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it\" (Genesis 2:2–3; Moses 3:2–3; Abraham 5:2–3; see D&C 59:9–13).\n\n## Interactive Activities (20-25 minutes)\n**Activity 1: Video & \"Because I Am Created in God's Image\" Challenge (10 minutes)**  \nWatch \"God’s Greatest Creation\" (Gospel Library)—President Nelson shares: How does Heavenly Father want me to feel about my body? (Come, Follow Me). Then, complete: “Because I know I am created in God’s image, I choose to…” (e.g., treat my body with respect). Connect to \"Your body is sacred\" (For the Strength of Youth, pages 22–29). Share one in pairs. Counter the lie: Some say being in God's image means no need to improve—what about Mosiah 3:19 and Ether 12:27?\n\n**Activity 2: Small Group Sabbath Role-Play & Creation Scavenger Hunt (10-15 minutes)**  \nBreak into groups of 3-4. Role-play: A friend texts, \"Come to the party Sunday—it's chill!\" How do you respond using Genesis 2:2–3? (\"God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.\") Report back one fun way to make Sabbath a \"delight\" (watch \"The Sabbath Is a Delight\" video if time). Bonus: Quick outdoor (or photo) scavenger hunt for Creation days (e.g., light, animals)—tie to D&C 101:32–34. Sing \"My Heavenly Father Loves Me\" (Children’s Songbook, 228–29) or \"All Creatures of Our God and King\" (Hymns, no. 62).\n\n**Activity 3 (Optional Quickie): Would You Rather Dilemma**  \nWould you rather skip church for a group hangout or care for a littered park trail? Why? Link to stewardship (D&C 104:13–18; Gérald Caussé, “Our Earthly Stewardship,” Liahona, Nov. 2022).\n\n## Real-Life Application (10 minutes)\n- **Body image & social media:** When filters and comments make you feel \"less than,\" remember you're in God's image (Genesis 1:26–27). Choose to post positively or log off—unlike \"messages you might hear from others\" (Come, Follow Me).\n- **Peer pressure on weekends:** Friends gaming all Sunday? Honor the sanctified Sabbath (Genesis 2:2–3) with family time or service—makes it \"blessed\" for you.\n- **Dating & future goals:** See eternal marriage potential (Genesis 2:18–25)—prep now with For the Strength of Youth standards, treating others as divine.\n- **School/environmental stress:** \"Subdue\" chaos by caring for earth (Genesis 1:28)—pick up trash at lunch, recharge like Creation's order.\n- **Missionary prep:** Share Creation pics/testimonies online, showing reverence for the Creator.\n\n## Testimony Moment & Challenge (5 minutes)\nI love how these scriptures remind us Heavenly Father and Jesus see us as Their masterpiece in progress—full of light and purpose, just like the world They organized from nothing. Who's felt that spark when noticing a sunset or your own strengths? Share if you want.  \n\n**Weekly Challenge:** Pick one—like \"Because I am created in God’s image, I choose to [your sentence]\" or make Sabbath different this week. Text a friend a Creation pic with your why (Genesis 1). Report back next time—watch God make something magnificent out of your week!  \n\n*(Total time: 45-55 minutes. Adapt for class size.
