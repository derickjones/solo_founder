This week's scriptures show Heavenly Father and Jesus turning emptiness into epic beauty, just like They can level up your world. What's one \"unorganized\" spot in your life begging for Their creative touch?\n\n## Core Truths\n1. **Jesus Created the World Under the Father**: \"By mine Only Begotten I created these things\" (from Genesis 1:1–25; Moses 2:1–25; Abraham 4:1–25). Ponder this outdoors or with \"All Creatures of Our God and King\" (Hymns, no. 62)—it reveals Heavenly Father, Jesus, the world, and you as part of Their masterpiece (Doctrine and Covenants 101:32–34).\n   \n2. **You're Made in God's Image**: \"Created in [God’s] own image, in the image of his own body, male and female created he them\" (Genesis 1:26–27; Moses 2:26–27; Abraham 4:26–27). This boosts self-worth against negativity—complete: \"Because I know I am created in God’s image, I choose to…\" Review \"Your body is sacred\" in *For the Strength of Youth* (pages 22–29). Watch President Nelson's \"God’s Greatest Creation\" video: How does Heavenly Father want you to feel about your body?\n\n3. **Marriage is Ordained of God**: Adam and Eve were \"joined together in marriage for time and for all eternity by the power of [the] everlasting priesthood\" (Genesis 1:27–28; 2:18–25; Moses 3:18, 21–24; Abraham 5:14–18; Russell M. Nelson, “Lessons from Eve,” *Ensign*, Nov. 1987, 87). Honor it as sacred (1 Corinthians 11:11; “The Family: A Proclamation to the World”).\n\n4. **Stewardship Over Creations**: \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over … every living thing\" (Genesis 1:28; Moses 2:28; Abraham 4:28). Care for it (Doctrine and Covenants 59:16–21; 104:13–18; Gérald Caussé, “Our Earthly Stewardship,” *Liahona*, Nov. 2022).\n\n5. **Sabbath is Blessed and Holy**: God \"rested on the seventh day … and sanctified it\" (Genesis 2:2–3; Moses 3:2–3; Abraham 5:2–3). Make it a delight (Doctrine and Covenants 59:9–13; “The Sabbath Is a Delight” video).\n\n## Daily Dive\n**Day 1 (Jan 12)**: Genesis 1:1–25. Journal: Spot 3 creations that hype you up—like mountains for TikTok scrolls. Text a friend: \"Jesus made this—mind blown!\"\n\n**Day 2 (Jan 13)**: Moses 2:1–25. Quick meme: \"Earth went from chaos to glow-up (Moses 2:2).\" How's Jesus creating light in your school stress?\n\n**Day 3 (Jan 14)**: Genesis 1:26–27; Moses 2:26–27. Mirror check: \"I'm God's image—body is sacred (*For the Strength of Youth*, p. 22).\" Watch \"God’s Greatest Creation\"—note one way to cherish it.\n\n**Day 4 (Jan 15)**: Abraham 4:26–28. Group text quorum/class: Share a pic of God's creation + \"I'm steward over this (Abraham 4:28)!\"\n\n**Day 5 (Jan 16)**: Genesis 2:18–25; Moses 3:18, 21–24. Ponder eternal marriage. Song: \"My Heavenly Father Loves Me\" (Children’s Songbook, 228–29). How does this prep your future fam?\n\n**Day 6 (Jan 17)**: Genesis 2:2–3; Moses 3:2–3. List 3 Sabbath wins (watch “The Sabbath Is a Delight”). What's your holy Sunday vibe?\n\n**Day 7 (Jan 18)**: Abraham 5:2–3, 14–18. Review week: \"God turns void to victory.\" Challenge: Act on one truth today.\n\n## Activity Ideas\n1. **Creation Scavenger Hunt**: Teams hunt outside for Day 1–6 creations (Genesis 1; Old Testament Stories, 8–12). Snap pics, share testimonies like \"Jesus made this beauty!\"\n\n2. **Body Puzzle Relay**: Draw bodies (Moses 2:26–27), cut into puzzles. Race to assemble while shouting \"God's image!\" Discuss *For the Strength of Youth* body tips.\n\n3. **Sabbath Role-Play**: Pairs act explaining Genesis 2:2–3 to a \"friend\" skipping church. Use “The Sabbath Is a Delight” clips for inspo.\n\n4. **Stewardship Service**: Pick up trash or plant something (Doctrine and Covenants 59:16–21). Tie to Abraham 4:28 dominion.\n\n5. **Image Affirmation Videos**: Film 15-sec clips: \"Because I'm in God's image (Genesis 1:26), I choose…\" Share in class.\n\n## Real-Life Connections\nSocial media blasts perfect bodies? Counter with \"God’s Greatest Creation\"—your body's a miracle, not a filter fail (Mosiah 3:19; Ether 12:27). Peer pressure on dating? Honor marriage's sacredness (“The Family: A Proclamation”) amid hook-up culture. Earth Day vibes? Stewardship fights climate doom-scrolling (Gérald Caussé talk). Sabbath scrolls? Swap for holy recharge to crush week goals or mission prep.\n\n## Faith Boost\nYou are God's divine creation-in-progress—He’s not done making you magnificent! Share in group chat: One Creation truth lighting your path? Challenge: Pick a \"Because I’m in God’s image, I choose…\" action this week. I know Jesus, the Creator, lives and transforms our chaos—lean in, youth! (Genesis 1:26–27). Let's glow. 🚀\n\n*(Word count: 748)*",
