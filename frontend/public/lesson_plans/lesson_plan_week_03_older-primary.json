  "content": "**Lesson Overview**  \nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ created a beautiful world for us, full of light, plants, animals, and people (Genesis 1:1–25; Moses 2:1–25). We are Their greatest creation, made in God's image, which means we are special and can become like Him (Genesis 1:26–27; Moses 2:26–27). For 8-10-year-olds, this builds gratitude, self-worth, and responsibility to care for creations and keep the Sabbath holy (Genesis 2:2–3; Moses 3:2–3).\n\n**TEACHER LESSON**  \n**Hook**: Hold up a mirror and a picture of a baby animal next to its parent. Ask, \"Who do you look like? Animals look like their parents—guess who we look like?\"  \n**Scripture Story**: \"In the beginning, the earth was empty, but Heavenly Father said, 'Let us make light,' and Jesus created day and night, sky, seas, plants, animals, and people (Genesis 1; Moses 2). On the seventh day, God rested and made it holy (Moses 3:2–3). Ask: What day did Jesus make animals? How do you feel seeing His creations?\"  \n**Gospel Principle**: \"Jesus created the world under Heavenly Father's direction. We are made 'in [His] image, after [His] likeness' (Moses 2:26), so our bodies are sacred gifts (see 'Your body is sacred' in For the Strength of Youth).\"  \n**Application**: \"At home, say thank you for one creation. Care for animals or plants. On Sunday, do things that make it holy, like reading scriptures.\"\n\n**Opening Activity**  \n**Creation I Spy (Interactive Discussion)**: Hide 6-8 picture cards around the room (sun, tree, fish, bird, person—from \"The Creation of the Earth\" in Old Testament Stories, pages 8–12). Children search and shout, \"I spy God's creation!\" Discuss: \"Who made this? How does it show Jesus' love?\"\n\n**Scripture Focus**  \nMoses 2:26–27: \"And I, God, said unto mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning: Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and it was so. And I, God, said: Let them have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\"  \n*Child-friendly*: Heavenly Father and Jesus made us to look like Them and care for the earth—like special helpers!\n\n**Interactive Activities**  \n\n**Activity 1: Creation Days Object Lesson (Object Lesson)**  \nMaterials: 7 jars or bags with items (bag 1: yellow paper \"light\"; bag 2: blue paper \"sky\"; bag 3-6: toy fish/plants/animals/people; bag 7: soft cloth \"rest\").  \nSteps: 1. Number bags 1-7. 2. Read simple phrases from Genesis 1/Moses 2 (e.g., \"Day 1: Let there be light!\"). 3. Child pulls item from bag and holds it up as class cheers. 4. End with bag 7: \"God rested and blessed the Sabbath.\" (10 min)  \nConnection: Shows Jesus creating step-by-step, like in Genesis 1:1–25.  \nQuestions: \"What would earth be like without Day 3's plants? How can we care for Day 6's animals (Genesis 1:28)?\"\n\n**Activity 2: Heavenly Father Loves Me Dance (Music & Movement)**  \nMaterials: Printed lyrics to \"My Heavenly Father Loves Me\" (Children’s Songbook, 228–29).  \nSteps: 1. Teach song with actions: point up for \"heavenly Father,\" hug self for \"loves me,\" touch eyes/ears/nose/mouth. 2. Sing while marching/dancing around room. 3. Freeze and name a creation (e.g., \"flowers!\"). Add thanks like \"Thank you for birds!\" (10 min)  \nConnection: Celebrates creations that help us feel God's love (Teaching Children section).  \nQuestions: \"What body part in the song shows we're in God's image? How does singing make Sunday holy?\"\n\n**Activity 3: Body Puzzle Craft (Hands-On Crafts)**  \nMaterials: Paper, crayons, scissors (pre-draw simple body outlines if needed).  \nSteps: 1. Children draw themselves or a friend on paper. 2. Cut into 6-8 puzzle pieces. 3. Swap puzzles with partner to assemble. 4. On back, write \"I am in God's image (Moses 2:26)!\" (10 min)  \nConnection: Teaches reverence for bodies as God's likeness (Genesis 1:26–27).  \nQuestions: \"Why is your body sacred? What will you do to care for it, like in 'Your body is sacred' (For the Strength of Youth)?\"\n\n**Testimony Time**  \nPass the talking stick (decorated stick or toy). Ask: \"What creation makes you feel Heavenly Father loves you? How does knowing you're in His image make you feel?\" Share your feeling: \"I love seeing Jesus' creations—it reminds me He made me special too.\"\n\n**Take-Home Challenge**  \nDraw or find one of God's creations at home. Tell your family, \"Jesus made this, and I'm in His image!\" (Genesis 1:27).\n\n**Teacher Tips**  \nTime activities strictly (use timer) to fit 30-40 min. For wiggly kids, add standing claps between activities; for shy ones, pair for sharing. Sing song daily at home for reinforcement.\n\n(Word count: 748)",
