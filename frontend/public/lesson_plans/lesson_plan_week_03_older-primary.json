For 8-10-year-olds, this builds gratitude for creation, self-worth, and respect for their bodies and the world. It helps them feel Heavenly Father's love amid everyday chaos.\n\n## Opening Activity (5 minutes): *I Spy God's Creations* (Interactive Discussion)\nShow printed pictures or draw quickly on board: mountains, animals, sky, flowers (from \"The Creation of the Earth\" in Old Testament Stories). Play \"I Spy\": \"I spy something Jesus created on day 3 that is green and grows!\" Kids guess and share why it's beautiful.  \n*Connects to theme*: Introduces Creation periods playfully.  \n*Materials*: 5-6 pictures or drawings.\n\n## TEACHER LESSON (8-10 minutes)\n**Hook (1-2 minutes)**: Hold up a mirror. \"Look at yourself! What makes you special? Today we'll learn we're made in God's image, just like Jesus created the whole beautiful world!\"  \n**Scripture Story (3-4 minutes)**: \"In Genesis 1 and Moses 2, Heavenly Father said, 'By mine Only Begotten [Jesus] I created these things.' On day 1, Jesus made light. Day 2: sky and waters. Day 3: land and plants. Day 4: sun, moon, stars. Day 5: birds and fish. Day 6: animals—and us! Ask: What day did Jesus make your favorite animal? How does it feel to know Jesus made butterflies and oceans?\"  \n**Gospel Principle (2-3 minutes)**: \"We're created 'in [God's] image, after [His] likeness' (Genesis 1:26–27; Moses 2:26–27). Like baby animals look like their parents, we look like Heavenly Father—special and able to create good things too!\"  \n**Application (1-2 minutes)**: \"Care for your body like a gift (see 'Your body is sacred' in For the Strength of Youth). Pick up litter to care for Jesus' creations (Genesis 1:28; Moses 2:28).\"\n\n## Scripture Focus\n**Moses 2:26–27**: \"And I, God, said unto mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning: Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and it was so. And I, God, said: Let them have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\"  \n*Child-friendly*: Heavenly Father and Jesus made us to look like Them—special helpers who take care of animals and earth!\n\n## Interactive Activities (15-20 minutes total)\n### 1. Mirror Image Object Lesson (Object Lessons, 5 minutes)\n**Steps**: 1. Give each child a small mirror. 2. Read Moses 2:26–27 together (kids follow printed strips). 3.

What will you do to care for God's gift of your body?\"\n\n### 2. Heavenly Father Loves Me Song Dance (Music & Movement, 5-7 minutes)\n**Steps**: 1. Teach \"My Heavenly Father Loves Me\" (Children’s Songbook, 228–29). 2. Add actions: Point up for Father, hug self for loves me, flap arms for birds, wiggle for fish, spin for stars. 3. Sing/march around room twice. 4. Add one creation kids love (e.g., puppies—bark and wag!).  \n**Materials**: Song lyrics printed or projected.  \n**Connection**: Celebrates Jesus' creations, helping feel His love (Genesis 1; Moses 2).  \n**Questions**: \"What creation in the song shows Heavenly Father's love? How can we say thanks?\"\n\n### 3. Body Puzzle Craft (Hands-On Crafts, 5-7 minutes)\n**Steps**: 1. Kids draw simple body outline on paper. 2. Teacher cuts into 4-6 puzzle pieces (pre-cut optional). 3. As they reassemble: Say one way to thank God (e.g., \"Eat healthy, be kind\"). 4. Glue reassembled puzzle to card: \"I am in God's image!\"  \n**Materials**: Paper, crayons, scissors, glue.  \n**Connection**: Builds reverence for bodies as God's creation (Moses 2:26–27; \"Your body is sacred\").  \n**Questions**: \"Why is your body like a puzzle God made? How will you treat it sacredly?\"\n\n## Testimony Time (3 minutes)\nPass a soft ball: \"What do you feel about Jesus creating the world or you in God's image?\" Invite 3-4 shares: \"I feel happy God made puppies!\" Gently affirm: \"Jesus loves hearing that.\"\n\n## Take-Home Challenge\nDraw one thing Jesus created (like a flower or your hand) and tell your family, \"Jesus made this because He loves me—I'm in God's image!\" (Genesis 1:26–27).\n\n## Teacher Tips\n- Prep mirrors/pictures ahead; for wiggly groups, add timer claps between activities.  \n- Adapt for smaller classes: Pair kids for puzzles; use phone video of song if no print.\n\n*(Word count: 748)*",
