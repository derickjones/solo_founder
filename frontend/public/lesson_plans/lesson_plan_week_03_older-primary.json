It also highlights how God blessed the Sabbath day as holy (Genesis 2:2–3). For 8-10-year-olds, these truths build gratitude for creation, self-respect for their divine potential, and simple ways to honor the Sabbath.\n\n## Opening Activity (5 minutes): Chaos to Creation Object Lesson\n**Activity Type**: Object Lessons  \nGather everyday items like socks, toys, blocks, and paper in a big messy pile on the floor or table. Ask, \"What does this look like? Messy and empty, right?\" (Like earth \"without form, and void\" in Genesis 1:2.) Quickly organize them into a fun tower or picture. Say, \"Just like Jesus organized the earth from nothing into something beautiful!\"  \n**Materials**: Household messy items, basket.  \n**Connection**: Shows how Jesus created order and beauty (Moses 2:1–25).  \n**Discussion**: \"How does this make you feel about Jesus?\"\n\n## Scripture Focus\n**Key Verse 1**: Genesis 1:26–27 – \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness... So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\"  \n*Child-friendly*: Heavenly Father and Jesus made us to look like Them and act kindly like Them—we are special!  \n\n**Key Verse 2**: Genesis 2:2–3 – \"And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.\"  \n*Child-friendly*: After creating everything good, God made Sunday special and holy to rest and worship.\n\n## Main Activities (15-20 minutes total)\n\n### 1. Creation Sing-Along March (5 minutes)\n**Activity Type**: Music & Movement  \n1. Teach \"My Heavenly Father Loves Me\" (Children’s Songbook, 228–29).  \n2. Sing while marching around the room: Add actions—point to sky for \"heavenly Father,\" hug self for \"loves me,\" touch eyes/nose/mouth for body parts Jesus created.  \n3. Pause to name creations: \"What did Jesus make on day 4? (Stars, moon!)\"  \n**Materials**: Song lyrics printed or projected (optional).  \n**Connection**: Celebrates Jesus creating the world and our bodies (Genesis 1:1–25; Moses 2:1–25).  \n**Discussion**: \"What in the song shows God's love? How do you feel His creations?\"\n\n### 2. Image of God Body Puzzles (5-7 minutes)\n**Activity Type**: Hands-On Crafts  \n1. Give each child a paper outline of a simple body (head, arms, legs).  \n2. Let them draw/color their face, hair, clothes—showing they are made in God's image.  \n3. Cut into 4-6 puzzle pieces; trade with a friend to reassemble.  \n4. As they put together, say, \"We fit perfectly because Heavenly Father designed us!\"  \n**Materials**: Paper body outlines (pre-drawn), crayons, scissors.  \n**Connection**: Teaches we are created \"in the image of God\" male and female (Moses 2:26–27).  \n**Discussion**: \"Why is your body sacred? How can you thank God for it?\"\n\n### 3. Holy Sabbath Choices Relay (5 minutes)\n**Activity Type**: Physical Activities & Games  \n1. Set up two sides of room: \"Holy Sabbath\" station (pictures of church, family prayer, scripture reading) and \"Other Days\" station (toys, TV, shopping).  \n2. Divide into teams; on \"Go,\" child runs to choose one card/picture from \"Holy Sabbath\" pile, brings back, next goes.  \n3. Review choices together.  \n**Materials**: Printed pictures or drawn cards (church, pray, play soccer).  \n**Connection**: God \"blessed and sanctified\" the seventh day (Moses 3:2–3)—we choose holy activities.  \n**Discussion**: \"What makes Sunday different? How does it show love for Jesus?\"\n\n## Testimony Time (3 minutes)\nGather in a circle. Ask, \"What do you feel when you think of Jesus creating you and the world?\" Invite 2-3 children to share simply, like \"I feel happy\" or \"I know He loves me.\" Share your own: \"I love seeing mountains and know Jesus made them for us.\"\n\n## Take-Home Challenge\nDraw one thing Jesus created (like a flower or your hand) and tell your family, \"Jesus made this—thank You!\" (Genesis 1:1–25).\n\n## Teacher Tips\n- Time activities with a timer to keep energy high; adapt crafts for smaller groups by partnering kids.  \n- If short on space, do relay as stand/sit choices: Thumbs up for holy Sabbath ideas.  \n*(Word count: 652)*",
