  "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\nThe Bible begins with the words “in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). But what was therebeforethis “beginning”? Andwhydid God create all of this? Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord has shed light on these questions.\n\nFor example, He gave us the record of a vision in which Abraham saw our existence as spirits “before the world was” (seeAbraham 3:22–28). The Lord also gave us an inspired translation or revision of the first six chapters of Genesis, called the book of Moses—which doesn’t begin with “in the beginning.” Instead, it begins with an experience Moses had that provides some context for the Creation story. Together, these latter-day scriptures are a good place to start our study of the Old Testament because they address some fundamental questions that can frame our reading: Who is God? Who are we? What is God’s work, and what is our place in it? The opening chapters of Genesis could be seen as the Lord’s response to Moses’s request: “Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens” (Moses 1:36).",

      "content": "“If the Lord were speaking to you directly,” President Russell M. Nelson taught, “the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity” (“Choices for Eternity” [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 2022], Gospel Library). It follows that Satan would try to confuse you on that same point. Look for this pattern in God’s message to Moses inMoses 1:4, 6and in Satan’s messages inMoses 1:12. What do you learn from these verses about the differences between God and Satan?\n\nPresident Nelson also taught, “The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make” (“Choices for Eternity”). Consider making a list of choices you make because your identity as a child of God comes before other labels.\n\nWhat additional verses or phrases inMoses 1help you understand your divine worth? You might also read more of President Nelson’s message in the section of “Choices for Eternity” titled “First: Know the truth about who you are.” What do you feel inspired to do to make your identity as a child of God your most important identifier?\n\nSee also “I Am a Child of God,”Hymns(1985), no. 301; “Our True Identity” (video), Gospel Library; Topics and Questions, “Children of God,” Gospel Library.\n\nOur True Identity\n\nMoses 1:12–26"

      "content": "AsMoses 1clearly shows, powerful spiritual experiences do not mean we’ll never be tempted again. In fact, one of Satan’s tactics is to tempt us to doubt these experiences. As you read Moses’s response to Satan inverses 12–26, what do you learn that can help you stay true to the testimony you have received? What was it that finally helped Moses overcome Satan?\n\nAnother lesson from Moses’s experience is that Satan tempts us with counterfeits of God’s truth and power. Think of some fake versions of things, such as an artificial plant or a baby doll. How can you tell they’re fake? Then consider the counterfeits Satan uses today to tempt you. What do you learn fromMoses 1:13–18about how to recognize and reject his counterfeits? How can the Lord help you? (seeMoses 1:24–26).\n\nSee alsoMatthew 4:1–11; Gary E. Stevenson, “Deceive Me Not,”EnsignorLiahona, Nov. 2019, 93–96; “I Am a Son of God” (video), Gospel Library.\n\nI Am a Son of God\n\nLearning at home can be planned but also spontaneous.“Teaching opportunities in the family frequently occur in informal, everyday moments—while eating a meal, doing chores, playing games, [or] traveling” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 31). For example, in addition to reading about how Moses resisted Satan inMoses 1, you might spend a few moments at dinnertime talking as a family about how you resisted the influence of the adversary.\n\nMoses 1:27–39;Abraham 3"

What’s the difference between immortality and eternal life? (see Topics and Questions, “Eternal Life,” Gospel Library). How does Jesus Christ help bring to pass both? Abraham also had a vision, recorded inAbraham 3. What do you find inverses 24–26that could help answer Moses’s request?\n\nAbraham 3:22–28"

      "content": "After you read together God’s message to Moses inMoses 1:4, consider letting your children look at their reflection in a mirror and giving themselves a similar message: “I am a child of God.” Then they could give the same message to each other: “You are a child of God.” You might even find pictures of a variety of people and invite your children to point to each one and say, “This is a child of God.” Share with each other why you are glad to know you are children of God. How does this knowledge change the way you treat yourselves and others?\n\nYou and your children could compare God’s message to Moses inMoses 1:4with Satan’s message inverse 12.

To help them learn about it, you could give them some key words and phrases to find inAbraham 3:22–28, like “before the world was,” “spirits,” “make an earth,” and “prove.” What do these verses teach us about why Heavenly Father sent us to earth?\n\nA song like “I Will Follow God’s Plan” (Children’s Songbook, 164–65) could reinforce whatAbraham 3teaches. Maybe you could invite your children to draw pictures that go with the words.\n\nHelp your children think of situations in which they have to choose whether or not to do what God has asked them to (seeAbraham 3:25; see alsoFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices). Let them practice possible responses to these situations. How can the Savior help us when we make a wrong choice?\n\nFor more, see this month’s issue of theFriendmagazine.\n\nMoses Overcomes Satan, by Joseph Brickey"
