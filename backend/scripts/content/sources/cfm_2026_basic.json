        "content": "The Bible begins with the words “in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” (\nGenesis 1:1\n). But what was there\nbefore\nthis “beginning”? And\nwhy\ndid God create all of this? Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord has shed light on these questions.\nFor example, He gave us the record of a vision in which Abraham saw our existence as spirits “before the world was” (see\nAbraham 3:22–28\n). The Lord also gave us an inspired translation or revision of the first six chapters of Genesis, called the book of Moses—which doesn’t begin with “in the beginning.” Instead, it begins with an experience Moses had that provides some context for the Creation story. Together, these latter-day scriptures are a good place to start our study of the Old Testament because they address some fundamental questions that can frame our reading: Who is God? Who are we? What is God’s work, and what is our place in it? The opening chapters of Genesis could be seen as the Lord’s response to Moses’s request: “Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens” (\nMoses 1:36\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMoses 1\nAs a child of God, I have a divine destiny.\n“If the Lord were speaking to you directly,” President Russell M. Nelson taught, “the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity” (“\nChoices for Eternity\n” [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 2022], Gospel Library). It follows that Satan would try to confuse you on that same point. Look for this pattern in God’s message to Moses in\nMoses 1:4, 6\nand in Satan’s messages in\nMoses 1:12\n. What do you learn from these verses about the differences between God and Satan?\nPresident Nelson also taught, “The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make” (“\nChoices for Eternity\n”). Consider making a list of choices you make because your identity as a child of God comes before other labels.\nWhat additional verses or phrases in\nMoses 1\nhelp you understand your divine worth? You might also read more of President Nelson’s message in the section of “Choices for Eternity” titled “\nFirst: Know the truth about who you are.\n” What do you feel inspired to do to make your identity as a child of God your most important identifier?\nSee also “\nI Am a Child of God\n,”\nHymns\n(1985), no. 301; “\nOur True Identity\n” (video), Gospel Library; Topics and Questions, “\nChildren of God\n,” Gospel Library.\n3:39\nOur True Identity\nMoses 1:12–26\nWith the Lord’s help, I can resist Satan.\nAs\nMoses 1\nclearly shows, powerful spiritual experiences do not mean we’ll never be tempted again. In fact, one of Satan’s tactics is to tempt us to doubt these experiences. As you read Moses’s response to Satan in\nverses 12–26\n, what do you learn that can help you stay true to the testimony you have received? What was it that finally helped Moses overcome Satan?\nAnother lesson from Moses’s experience is that Satan tempts us with counterfeits of God’s truth and power. Think of some fake versions of things, such as an artificial plant or a baby doll. How can you tell they’re fake? Then consider the counterfeits Satan uses today to tempt you. What do you learn from\nMoses 1:13–18\nabout how to recognize and reject his counterfeits? How can the Lord help you? (see\nMoses 1:24–26\n).\nSee also\nMatthew 4:1–11\n; Gary E. Stevenson, “\nDeceive Me Not\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 93–96; “I Am a Son of God” (video), Gospel Library.\n6:31\nI Am a Son of God\nLearning at home can be planned but also spontaneous.\n“Teaching opportunities in the family frequently occur in informal, everyday moments—while eating a meal, doing chores, playing games, [or] traveling” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n, 31). For example, in addition to reading about how Moses resisted Satan in\nMoses 1\n, you might spend a few moments at dinnertime talking as a family about how you resisted the influence of the adversary.\nMoses 1:27–39\n;\nAbraham 3\nGod’s work and glory is to help me gain eternal life.\nAfter seeing a vision of God’s creations, Moses said to the Lord: “Tell me … why these things are so” (\nMoses 1:30\n). What impresses you about the Lord’s response in\nMoses 1:31–39\n? What’s the difference between immortality and eternal life? (see Topics and Questions, “\nEternal Life\n,” Gospel Library). How does Jesus Christ help bring to pass both? Abraham also had a vision, recorded in\nAbraham 3\n. What do you find in\nverses 24–26\nthat could help answer Moses’s request?\nAbraham 3:22–28\nI lived as a spirit before I was born on earth.\nWe know very little about our premortal life. But much of what we do know comes from Abraham’s vision in\nAbraham 3:22–28\n. As you read these verses, make a list of truths you find—including truths about yourself and about Jesus Christ. Why are these truths valuable to you? What difference do they make in your life?\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nPremortal Life\n,” Gospel Library.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhat is the book of Moses?\nWhat is the book of Abraham?\nWhat does it mean to “chosen,” or foreordained?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nMoses 1:1–4, 6, 12\nI am a child of God.\nAfter you read together God’s message to Moses in\nMoses 1:4\n, consider letting your children look at their reflection in a mirror and giving themselves a similar message: “I am a child of God.” Then they could give the same message to each other: “You are a child of God.” You might even find pictures of a variety of people and invite your children to point to each one and say, “This is a child of God.” Share with each other why you are glad to know you are children of God. How does this knowledge change the way you treat yourselves and others?\nYou and your children could compare God’s message to Moses in\nMoses 1:4\nwith Satan’s message in\nverse 12\n. How can you help your children distinguish between God’s messages to them and Satan’s?\nMoses Sees Jehovah\n, by Joseph Brickey (detail)\nMoses 1:6, 39\nHeavenly Father has a work for me to do.\nAs you read\nMoses 1:6\nwith your children, you might talk to them about the “work” God had for Moses. Consider using the\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 13–16\n, or\nOld Testament Stories\n,\npages 64–84\n, to help your children see what Moses accomplished with Heavenly Father’s help. What is the work God has for us to do? (see, for example,\nDoctrine and Covenants 11:20\n).\nMoses 1:12–26\nI can resist Satan’s temptations.\nAs you study\nMoses 1:12–26\nwith your children, help them discover what Moses did to resist Satan (see\nverses 13, 15, 18, 20–22, 26\n). It might be fun for them to act out things they can do to resist temptation (such as praying, walking away, or asking for help).\nAbraham 3:22–28\nI lived as a spirit before I was born on earth.\nKnowing about our premortal life can inspire your children to make choices based on eternal truths. To help them learn about it, you could give them some key words and phrases to find in\nAbraham 3:22–28\n, like “before the world was,” “spirits,” “make an earth,” and “prove.” What do these verses teach us about why Heavenly Father sent us to earth?\nA song like “\nI Will Follow God’s Plan\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 164–65) could reinforce what\nAbraham 3\nteaches. Maybe you could invite your children to draw pictures that go with the words.\nHelp your children think of situations in which they have to choose whether or not to do what God has asked them to (see\nAbraham 3:25\n; see also\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n). Let them practice possible responses to these situations. How can the Savior help us when we make a wrong choice?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Because the world around us is so beautiful and majestic, it’s hard to imagine the earth when it was “without form, and void” and “empty and desolate” (\nGenesis 1:2\n;\nAbraham 4:2\n). One thing the Creation story teaches us is that God can, over time, make something magnificent out of something unorganized. That’s helpful to remember when life seems chaotic. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are Creators, and Their creative work with us is not finished. They can make light shine in dark moments in our lives. They can fill our emptiness with life. They can transform us into the divine beings we were meant to be. That’s what it means to be created in God’s image, after His likeness (see\nGenesis 1:26\n). We have the potential to become like Him: exalted, glorified, heavenly.\nFor an overview of the book of Genesis, see “\nGenesis\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 1:1–25\n;\nMoses 2:1–25\n;\nAbraham 4:1–25\n“By mine Only Begotten I created these things.”\nAlthough we don’t know everything about how the world was created, it’s interesting to note what God has chosen to reveal about the Creation. What does God teach you about it in\nGenesis 1:1–25\n;\nMoses 2:1–25\n; and\nAbraham 4:1–25\n? Why does He want you to know these things? As you ponder these accounts, you might also consider what they teach you about Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, the world, and yourself.\nTo enrich your study, consider reading these verses while out among God’s creations or while listening to a song like “\nAll Creatures of Our God and King\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 62). You could find pictures of His creations that help you feel reverence for the Creator. Consider sharing these pictures, along with your testimony, with others.\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 101:32–34\n.\nThe Garden of Eden\n, by Grant Romney Clawson\nGenesis 1:26–27\n;\nMoses 2:26–27\n;\nAbraham 4:26–27\nI am created in the image of God.\nAs you read\nGenesis 1:26–27\n;\nMoses 2:26–27\n; and\nAbraham 4:26–27\n, ponder what it means to be created in God’s “image” or “likeness,” male and female. Why is it important to you to know the truths in these verses? For example, how do these truths affect the way you see yourself, others, and God? How can they help you when you have negative feelings about yourself?\nTo help you think about these questions, try completing a sentence like this one: “Because I know I am created in God’s image, I choose to …” Reviewing “\nYour body is sacred\n” in\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n(pages 22–29) can help. Consider choosing something you will do to show God that you know your body is sacred.\nIn the video “God’s Greatest Creation” (Gospel Library), President Russell M. Nelson bears testimony of the miraculous human body. As you watch this video, ask yourself, “How does Heavenly Father want me to feel about my body?” How is this different from messages you might hear from others?\n2:51\nGod's Greatest Creation\nSome people might say that being created in God’s image means that all of our thoughts, feelings, and desires are approved by Him and that we don’t need to (or cannot) improve. What would you say to that? What insights do you gain from\nMosiah 3:19\nand\nEther 12:27\n?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nYour Body: A Magnificent Gift to Cherish\n,”\nLiahona\n, Aug. 2019, 50–55.\nGenesis 1:27–28\n;\n2:18–25\n;\nMoses 3:18, 21–24\n;\nAbraham 5:14–18\nMarriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God.\n“Adam and Eve were joined together in marriage for time and for all eternity by the power of [the] everlasting priesthood” (Russell M. Nelson, “\nLessons from Eve\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 1987, 87). Ponder this as you read\nGenesis 1:27–28\n;\n2:18–25\n;\nMoses 3:18, 21–25\n; and\nAbraham 5:14–19\n. How can you treat marriage with the sacredness God has given it?\nSee also\n1 Corinthians 11:11\n; “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n,” Gospel Library.\nGenesis 1:28\n;\nMoses 2:28\n;\nAbraham 4:28\nI am responsible for caring for God’s creations.\nWhat do\nGenesis 1:28\n;\nMoses 2:28\n; and\nAbraham 4:28\nsuggest about our responsibility toward God’s creations?

As you read\nGenesis 2:2–3\n;\nMoses 3:2–3\n; and\nAbraham 5:2–3\n, think about what makes the Sabbath “blessed” to you.\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 59:9–13\n; “The Sabbath Is a Delight” (video), Gospel Library.\n0:50\nHighlight: The Sabbath Is a Delight\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nHow long did the Creation take?\nWhat is the Church’s position on evolution?\nWas Eve really created from Adam’s rib?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 1:1–25\n;\nMoses 2:1–25\n;\nAbraham 4:1–25\nJesus created the earth.\nHow will you make learning about the Creation fun for your children? You could take them on a search outside for the kinds of things that were made during each period of Creation. Your children might also look at pictures of things Jesus created (see “\nThe Creation of the Earth\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 8–12). Then you and your children could talk about how you feel about Jesus Christ after reading about the Creation.\nConsider singing a song together about our beautiful world, such as “\nMy Heavenly Father Loves Me\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 228–29). Maybe your children could add to the song other things God has created that help them feel His love.\nHelp children express their creativity.\n“When you invite children to draw, build, color, or write something related to a gospel principle, you help them better understand the principle and you give them a tangible reminder of what they have learned” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n32\n).\nGenesis 1:26–27\n;\nMoses 2:26–27\n;\nAbraham 4:26–27\nI was created in God’s image.\nYour children can develop a sense of reverence and respect for their own and others’ bodies as they learn that we were all created in God’s image. To help them understand what this means, you could let your children look at their image in a mirror or picture while you read\nMoses 2:26–27\nto them. You could also show them how baby animals are often in the “likeness” of their parents (see the picture in this outline, for example). This could lead to a conversation about why it’s important to you to know that you are created in your Heavenly Father’s image.\nYou and your children might enjoy drawing a human body and cutting the drawings into puzzles. As your children put their puzzles together, they could talk about ways they can show Heavenly Father that they are thankful for their bodies.\nGenesis 2:2–3\n;\nMoses 3:2–3\n;\nAbraham 5:2–3\nThe Sabbath day is holy.\nAs you read\nMoses 3:2–3\n, ask your children to listen for what God did on the seventh day. Help your children find or draw pictures of things they can do on Sunday to make it a holy day and different from other days. Share with each other why it is important to you to keep the Sabbath day holy.\nHelp your children role-play explaining to a friend why they choose to do things on Sunday that honor Heavenly Father and Jesus. Suggest that they use\nGenesis 2:2–3\nin their explanations. How does keeping the Sabbath day holy show our love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "At first, the story of the Fall of Adam and Eve might seem like a tragedy. Adam and Eve were cast out of the beautiful Garden of Eden. They were sent into a world of pain, sorrow, and death (see\nGenesis 3:16–19\n). And they were separated from their Heavenly Father. But the truths restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith in the book of Moses give us a unique perspective on the Fall.\nYes, the Garden of Eden was beautiful. But Adam and Eve needed more than beautiful surroundings. They needed—and we all need—an opportunity to grow. Leaving the Garden of Eden was the necessary first step toward returning to God and eventually becoming like Him. That meant facing opposition, making choices, making mistakes, learning to repent, and trusting the Savior, whose Atonement makes possible progression and “the joy of our redemption” (\nMoses 5:11\n). So when you read about the Fall of Adam and Eve, focus not on the seeming tragedy but on the possibilities—not on the paradise Adam and Eve lost but on the glory their choice allows us to receive.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 3\n;\nMoses 4\nThe Fall was a necessary part of God’s plan.\nIt’s true that Adam and Eve’s choice led to many of the difficulties we experience in mortality. But that doesn’t mean we regret their choice. As you read\nGenesis 3\nand\nMoses 4\n, you might ask yourself, why was the Fall important to God’s plan?\nAccording to\nMoses 5:9–12\n, how did Adam and Eve feel about the Fall? How can you apply their words to your experiences in this fallen world? What else do you learn from\n2 Nephi 2:19–25\n?\nSee also\nMosiah 3:19\n;\nAlma 12:21–37\n; and\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:39–43\n.\nLeaving Eden\n, by Annie Henrie Nader\nGenesis 3:1–7\n;\nMoses 4:22–31\n;\n5:4–15\nJesus Christ offers hope and redemption.\nAdam and Eve’s story is one of hope and redemption through Jesus Christ. To see why, you might start by searching for the results of the Fall in\nGenesis 3:1–7\n;\nMoses 4:22–31\nand marking or listing what you find. How do these results affect you? Then you could search\nMoses 5:4–15\n, looking for God’s plan to redeem us from these effects. Why were Adam and Eve “glad” after the angel visited them? What do you learn from them about Heavenly Father’s plan?\nSee also “Because of Him” (video), Gospel Library.\n2:44\nBecause of Him\nGenesis 3:16\n;\nMoses 4:22\nWhat does it mean that Adam was to “rule over” Eve?\nThis passage of scripture has sometimes been misunderstood to mean that a husband is justified in treating his wife unkindly. In our day, the Lord’s prophets have taught that a husband and wife should see each other as equal partners in fulfilling their divine responsibilities in the family (see “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n” [Gospel Library]). Elder Dale G. Renlund and Sister Ruth Lybbert Renlund explained that a righteous husband “will seek to minister; he will acknowledge error and seek forgiveness; he will be quick to offer praise; he will be considerate of family members’ preferences; he will feel the great weight of responsibility to provide ‘the necessities of life and protection’ for his family; he will treat his wife with the utmost respect and deference. … He will bless his family” (\nThe Melchizedek Priesthood: Understanding the Doctrine, Living the Principles\n[2018], 23).\nTo learn more about how the Lord views the relationship between husbands and wives, ponder the counsel of Elder Ulisses Soares in the following video. How would you explain, in your own words, what it means for husband wife to be “equal partners”?\n3:33\nEqual Partnership in Marriage\nMoses 4:1–4\nI need agency and opposition to grow.\nElder Dale G. Renlund taught, “Our Heavenly Father’s goal in parenting is not to have His children\ndo\nwhat is right; it is to have His children\nchoose\nto do what is right and ultimately become like Him” (“\nChoose You This Day\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 104). Why is it so important in Heavenly Father’s plan that we\nchoose\nto do what is right?\nAs you read\nMoses 4:1–4\n, look for what Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ did to protect your right to choose—your agency. How can you access their protecting power? For ideas, consider studying the section “\nMake inspired choices\n” in\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n(4–5).\nConsider also reading what Lehi taught about agency in\n2 Nephi 2:11–20, 25–30\n. Why is opposition necessary for agency? How can you show your appreciation to Jesus Christ for making you “free to choose”? (\n2 Nephi 2:27\n).\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nOpposition in All Things\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 114–17; Topics and Questions, “\nAgency\n,” Gospel Library; “\nChoose the Right\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 239.\nIncrease participation.\nMany learning activities can be done as an individual, family, or class; in small groups; or in pairs. Use a variety of methods to allow people to participate who might not otherwise have a chance. For this activity, you could invite one person or group to read\nMoses 4\nand the\nFor the Strength of Youth\nguide while another group studies the verses in\n2 Nephi 2\n. They could then teach each other what they learned in their respective section.\nMoses 4:4–12\n;\n5:13–33\nSatan seeks “to deceive and to blind” me.\nAs you read\nMoses 4:4–12\n;\n5:13–33\n, consider listing ways that Satan tried to tempt Adam and Eve and their children. How does he attempt these same things today? How does Heavenly Father help you resist Satan’s deceptions?\nMoses 4:13–16, 27\n“I, the Lord God … clothed them.”\nAfter partaking of the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve tried to cover their own nakedness. Later, the Lord offered to clothe them. As you read\nMoses 4:13–16, 27\n, consider the following:\nPonder what nakedness and clothing can represent in the scriptures (see, for example,\nRevelation 7:9, 13–15\n;\n2 Nephi 9:14\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 109:22–26, 76\n). What do you learn from Adam and Eve’s experience with nakedness and clothing?\nIf you have been endowed in the temple, consider what Adam and Eve might say to you about the significance of your temple garment and what it represents.\nSee also “Sacred Temple Clothing” (video), Gospel Library.\n4:12\nSacred Temple Clothing\nMoses 5:4–9, 16–26\nGod will accept my sacrifices if I offer them with a willing and obedient heart.\nAs you study\nMoses 5:4–9, 16–26\n, consider the attitudes of Adam and Eve and their sons Cain and Abel toward sacrifice. Why did the Lord accept Abel’s sacrifice but not Cain’s?\nWhat does the Lord ask you to sacrifice? Is there anything in these verses that shapes the way you think about those sacrifices?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nDid God give Adam and Eve conflicting commandments in the Garden of Eden?\nWas it a sin for Adam and Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit?\nWhat do we know about the curse and mark placed upon Cain?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 3\n;\nMoses 4\n;\n5:8–15\nJesus Christ saves us from the Fall.\nTo help your children better understand the Fall of Adam and Eve, you could copy the pictures from “\nAdam and Eve\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 13–16) and cut them out. Then you could work together to put the pictures in order as you discuss the experiences of Adam and Eve. As you do, talk about why it was important, in Heavenly Father’s plan, for Adam and Eve to leave the Garden of Eden.\nYour children can feel gratitude for the Atonement of Jesus Christ as they understand how He overcomes the effects of the Fall. As you read together\nMoses 4:25\n;\n6:48\n;\nRomans 5:12\n;\n2 Nephi 2:22–23\n, help your children find ways to complete this sentence: “Because of the Fall, I …” Then, as you read together\nMoses 5:8–11, 14–15\n;\n6:59\n;\nAlma 11:42\n, they could complete this sentence: “Because of Jesus Christ, I …” Share with each other your gratitude for Jesus Christ.\nMoses 4:1–4\nI can choose the right.\nConsider a simple object lesson to introduce the principle of agency: invite your children to color this week’s activity page, but give them only one color to use. Why would it be better to have choices? You could then read together\nMoses 4:1–4\nand talk about why God wants us to be able to choose between right and wrong. How do Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ help us make good choices?\nHelp your children think of and draw pictures of good choices they can make to follow Jesus Christ. Or you could sing together a song about making good choices, such as “\nChoose the Right Way\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 160–61). You might tell each other about a time when you made a good choice and talk about how you felt afterward.\nThe Fall\n, by Robert T. Barrett\nMoses 5:4, 8\nI can pray to Heavenly Father.\nWhen Adam and Eve had to leave the Garden of Eden, they couldn’t be with Heavenly Father anymore. Read\nMoses 5:4, 8\nwith your children, and help them find what Adam and Eve did to feel near to Him and hear Him. What are some things we can say to Heavenly Father in our prayers?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Most of\nGenesis 5\nis a list of the generations between Adam and Eve and Noah. We read a lot of names, but we don’t learn much about them. Then we read this intriguing but unexplained line: “And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him” (\nGenesis 5:24\n). Surely there’s a story behind that verse! But without further explanation, the list of generations resumes.\nThankfully,\nMoses 6\nreveals the details of Enoch’s story—and it’s quite a story. We learn of Enoch’s humility, his insecurities, the potential God saw in him, and the great work he performed as God’s prophet. We also get a clearer picture of the family of Adam and Eve as it progressed through the generations. We read of Satan’s “great dominion” but also of parents who taught children “the ways of God” (\nMoses 6:15, 21\n). Especially precious is what we learn about the doctrine these parents taught: faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost (see\nMoses 6:50–52\n). That doctrine, like the priesthood that accompanies it, “was in the beginning [and] shall be in the end of the world also” (\nMoses 6:7\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMoses 6:26–36\nSin limits my ability to see, feel, and hear the things of God.\nAs you study\nMoses 6:26–36\n, what do you learn about the effects of sin? How have you seen these effects? What attributes did Enoch have that helped him overcome these effects? How did God bless him as a result?\nMoses 6:26–47\nGod calls me to do His work despite my weaknesses.\nIf you ever feel overwhelmed with what the Lord has called you to do, you aren’t alone. Even Enoch felt that way when the Lord called him to be a prophet. As you read\nMoses 6:26–36\n, look for why Enoch felt overwhelmed and what the Lord said to give him courage.\nIn\nverses 37–47\n, you could look for ways the Lord supported Enoch and empowered him to do His work (see also\nMoses 7:13\n). You might compare Enoch’s experience with that of other prophets who felt inadequate, such as Moses (see\nExodus 4:10–16\n), Jeremiah (see\nJeremiah 1:4–10\n), Nephi (see\n2 Nephi 33:1–4\n), and Moroni (see\nEther 12:23–29\n). What do you feel God wants you to learn from these scriptures about the work He has given you to do?\nA Seer Hath the Lord Raised Up (Moses 6:36)\n, by Eva Timothy\nMany modern-day apostles and prophets have expressed feelings similar to Enoch’s when they described how it felt to receive their calls. For example, see the testimony of Elder Ulisses Soares in “\nProphets Speak by the Power of the Holy Spirit\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 98–99).\nWhat can you learn from these prophets and apostles about your feelings of inadequacy? When have you felt the Savior help you when He asked you to do hard things? Consider writing down a few experiences in your future when you will need to rely on the Savior’s help. How can you approach these events with faith in Jesus Christ?\nThis year’s youth theme, “Walk with Me,” is based on\nMoses 6:34\n. Click\nhere\nfor music and other resources related to this theme. What does it mean to walk with the Savior? What will you do to accept His invitation to walk with Him?\nSee also David A. Bednar, “\nAbide in Me, and I in You; Therefore Walk with Me,\n”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 123–25; “\nI’ll Go Where You Want Me to Go\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 270.\nMoses 6:48–68\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ was taught from the beginning.\nBecause we have the book of Moses, we know that God has been teaching His children how to find redemption ever since Adam and Eve. As you study\nMoses 6:48–68\n, search for what we must know and do to be redeemed. Notice Adam’s question in\nverse 53\n. Have you ever wondered that? What do you learn from the Lord’s answer in\nverses 53–65\n? You might think of these verses as the Lord’s message at Adam’s baptismal service. What do you learn about baptism from His message? Why do you think He compared baptism to being “born again”? (\nverse 59\n). What can you do to continue to be “born again” throughout your life?\nLook for symbols.\nIn the scriptures, objects or events can often represent or symbolize spiritual truths, especially truths about the Savior (see\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n7\n). These symbols can enrich your understanding of Him and His doctrine. For instance, what do you learn from the symbols of hearts and ears in\nMoses 6:27\n, eyes and clay in\nMoses 6:35\n, or water in\nMoses 6:59–60\n?\nMoses 6:51–62\n“Teach these things freely unto your children.”\nAfter teaching Adam truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ, in\nMoses 6:51–63\n, the Lord told Adam to teach them to future generations. Consider making a list of these truths. (It might help to divide the passage into smaller groups of verses, such as\nverses 51–52\n,\n53–57\n,\n58–60\n,\n61–63\n). Why are these truths valuable to today’s rising generation? What else can you learn from the Lord’s instructions to parents in\nMosiah 4:14–15\nand\nDoctrine and Covenants 68:25–28\n;\n93:40–50\n?\nReading about the “book of remembrance” that Adam and Eve’s family kept may inspire you or your family to make your own book of remembrance. What do you feel the Lord would want you to include? Consider saving information from your book of remembrance on\nFamilySearch.org\n.\nSee also Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “\nJesus Christ Is the Strength of Parents\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 55–59; “Parenting: Touching the Hearts of Our Youth,” “But Why?” (videos), Gospel Library.\n3:2\nParenting: Touching the Hearts of Our Youth\n1:1\nBut Why?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhat do the symbols of water, spirit, and blood teach us about being born again through Jesus Christ?\nHow did Adam become a “son of God”?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nMoses 6:26–34\nGod can help me do hard things.\nWhen Enoch was called to preach the gospel, he worried that he would fail. But God helped him. Read together this story in\nMoses 6:26–34\n(see also “\nEnoch the Prophet\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 19–21). Why did Enoch feel that he couldn’t preach the gospel? (see\nMoses 6:31\n). How did God help Enoch? (see\nMoses 6:32–34\n;\n7:13\n).\nYour children might enjoy sharing or acting out other examples of when God helped people do difficult things—for example, Noah, David, Ammon, or Samuel the Lamanite (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 7\n,\n19\n,\n78\n,\n81\n). You could also share an experience of your own and let your children talk about how God helps them do hard things.\nMoses 6:50–62\nFaith in Christ, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost prepare me to return to God.\nGod taught Adam what we need to do to return to Him—have faith in Jesus Christ, repent, be baptized, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Help your children find these principles in\nMoses 6:52, 57\n. Then you could help them write a short talk about one of the principles. Each talk could include a scripture from\nMoses 6\n, an experience, and a testimony. Let them share their talks with each other.\nYou could also display pictures that represent the first principles of the gospel (see the\nfourth article of faith\n). Place them in a line leading to a picture of Jesus Christ. As you read\nMoses 6:52\n, your children could stand next to the correct picture when they hear the words the picture represents.\nYour children might enjoy singing songs that teach the principles in\nMoses 6:52\n, such as “\nFaith\n,” “\nWhen I Am Baptized\n,” and “\nThe Holy Ghost\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 96–97, 103, 105). Help them find these principles in\nMoses 6:52\n.\nMoses 6:57–58\nHeavenly Father wants parents to teach their children.\nTo encourage your children to support their parents in their role as gospel teachers, consider asking a child to read\nMoses 6:58\nand identify the commandment God gave to parents. Then you could show a picture of Adam and Eve teaching their children (like the one at the end of this outline) and let your children talk about what they see in the picture. Your children could draw pictures of their families reading the scriptures together, praying together, or playing together.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Throughout history, people have tried to achieve what Enoch and his people accomplished: building an ideal society where there is no poverty or violence. As God’s people, we share this desire. We call it building Zion, and it includes—in addition to caring for people in need and promoting peace—making covenants, dwelling together in righteousness, and becoming one with each other and with Jesus Christ, “the King of Zion” (\nMoses 7:53\n). If the world, your community, or your family isn’t quite what you want it to be, it’s helpful to ask, How did Enoch and his people do it? How did they become “of one heart and one mind” (\nMoses 7:18\n) despite the contention around them? Among the many details\nMoses 7\ngives us about Zion, a particularly valuable one for Latter-day Saints might be this: Zion is not just a city—it is a condition of the heart and spirit. Zion, as the Lord has taught, is “the pure in heart” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:21\n). So perhaps the best way to build Zion is to start in our own hearts and homes.\nIdeas for Learning and Home and at Church\nMoses 7:16–21, 27, 53, 62–69\nI can help build Zion.\nWhen the Prophet Joseph Smith first learned about Enoch and his City of Holiness, he was inspired. He “knew the day had come when the Lord would again establish Zion on the earth” (\nSaints\n,\n1:108–9\n), and he started a lifelong quest to build Zion. Reading\nMoses 7\ncan inspire you to continue that effort today.\nYou might start by exploring the questions “What is Zion?” and “How is it different from the rest of the world?” Consider listing answers that come to you as you study\nMoses 7\n, in particular\nverses 16–21, 27, 53, 62–69\n.\nYour answers to these questions might make it clear that we still have a lot of work to do to build Zion. So how do we do it? It might help to think about times when you felt you were “of one heart and one mind” with someone (\nMoses 7:18\n). Maybe it was in a ward, family, or group at work or school. What did people do to create righteous unity?\nHere are some other resources that you could explore to find ideas and inspiration. Pick one or more to study, and then write down what you feel inspired to do to build Zion:\nPhilippians 2:1–4\n;\n4 Nephi 1:15–18\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:21\n;\n105:5\n.\nUlisses Soares, “\nBrothers and Sisters in Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 70–73.\nD. Todd Christofferson, “\nOne in Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 77–80.\n“We Come Together and Unite as One” (video), Gospel Library.\n6:21\nWe Come Together & Unite As One\nGod wants His people to be “of one heart and one mind” (\nMoses 7:18\n).\nMoses 7:53\nJesus Christ is “the King of Zion.”\nWhat does it mean to you to have Jesus Christ as your King? Note the other titles of Jesus Christ in this verse. What do they teach you about Him? What do you think it means to come “in at the gate and [climb] up by [Him]”?\nSee also “\nCome, O Thou King of Kings\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 59.\nMoses 7:28–69\nGod weeps—and rejoices—for His children.\nSome people see God as a distant being who isn’t emotionally affected by what happens to us. Enoch gained a different view of God in the vision recorded in\nMoses 7\n. What did he learn about God—and what do you learn—in\nverses 28–40\n? Why do you think Enoch was surprised to see God weep? Why is it important to you to know that He does?\nAs the vision continued, Enoch wept too. But God also shared with him reasons to rejoice. Look for them in\nMoses 7:41–69\n. What do you learn from Enoch’s vision that can help you “lift up your heart, and be glad,” despite the “bitterness” in your life (\nverse 44\n)?\nSee also Jeffrey R. Holland, “\nThe Grandeur of God\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2003, 70–73.\nMoses 7:59–67\nJesus Christ will come again in the last days.\nEnoch’s vision, especially what’s recorded in\nMoses 7:59–67\n, is one of history’s first prophecies of the Savior’s Second Coming. What impresses you about the way these verses describe the last days? For example, consider how you feel the prophecies from\nverse 62\nare being fulfilled. What do these phrases teach you about God’s work in the latter days?\nSee also Henry B. Eyring, “\nSisters in Zion\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 67–69.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhat does it mean that “seed of Cain were black”?\nWhat does it mean that the “Lamb is slain from the foundation of the world”?\nHow does the Joseph Smith Translation enhance our understanding of God’s covenant with Enoch and Noah?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nMoses 7:18–21, 62–63, 68–69\nGod wants us to be “of one heart and one mind.”\nTo help your children learn about Enoch and Zion, you could use “\nEnoch the Prophet\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n(19–21) or the second verse of “\nFollow the Prophet\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 110–11). Then you could ask your children to help you retell the story in their own words. The pictures of Enoch in this outline might help.\nHere’s one way to help your children understand what it means to be of “one heart and one mind” (\nMoses 7:18\n): Make a paper heart and cut it into pieces, enough for each child to have one. Let them write their name on their piece and work together to put the heart together. As they do, you might talk about things you love about each child.\nHelp your children count how many times the word “Zion” appears in\nMoses 7:18–21, 62–63, 68–69\n. Each time they find the word, help them discover what the verse says about Zion (see also Guide to the Scriptures, “\nZion\n,” Gospel Library). How can we be more like the people described in these verses?\nEncourage personal scripture study.\nWhether you’re teaching your family at home or a class on Sunday, one of the best ways you can help others build lasting faith in Jesus Christ is to help them establish a habit of seeking personal experiences with the scriptures. Share the experiences you’re having with the scriptures, and encourage family or class members to share their experiences. When we hear about how reading the scriptures is blessing others, we are often inspired to seek these same blessings from the Lord. (See\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n25\n.)\nMoses 7:32–33\nHeavenly Father wants me to choose to follow Him.\nTo introduce\nMoses 7:32–33\nto your children, you might talk to them about a choice they had to make recently. Then you could read the verses together to find out what Heavenly Father wants us to choose. What choices can we make to show that we choose Him? Perhaps your children could take turns acting out one of these choices while the others guess what the action represents.\nMoses 7:59–67\nJesus will come back to earth.\nIn\nMoses 7:59\n, Enoch asks the Lord a question. Invite your children to find it, and then ask them to find the answer in\nverse 60\n. You might also talk with them about a time when they were expecting someone to return home. Ask them how they felt and what they did to get ready. How can we get ready for Jesus to return?\nConsider showing pictures of times when the Savior appeared to people (such as\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 60\n,\n82\n,\n83\n, and\n84\n). What are the people doing in the pictures? How might the people have felt when they met Jesus? You could also sing a song about the Savior’s Second Coming, such as “\nWhen He Comes Again\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 82–83), and ask the children what they think it will be like when Jesus comes again. Let the children share how they feel about seeing Jesus when He comes again.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Living in the latter days, we have special reason to pay attention to the story of the Flood. When Jesus Christ taught how we should watch for His Second Coming, He said, “As it was in the days of Noah, so it shall be also at the coming of the Son of Man” (\nJoseph Smith—Matthew 1:41\n). In addition, words that describe Noah’s day, like “corrupt” and “filled with violence,” could just as easily describe our time (\nGenesis 6:12–13\n;\nMoses 8:28\n). The story of the Tower of Babel also feels applicable to our day, with its description of pride followed by confusion and then division.\nThese ancient accounts are valuable not just because they show us that wickedness repeats itself throughout history. More important, they teach us what to do about it. Noah “found grace in the eyes of the Lord” (\nMoses 8:27\n). And the families of Jared and his brother turned to the Lord and were protected from the confusion and division in Babel (see\nEther 1:33–43\n). If we wonder how to keep ourselves and our families safe during corruption and violence, the stories in these chapters have much to teach us.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 6\n;\nMoses 8\nThere is spiritual safety in following the Lord’s prophet.\nDo you see anything in the description of Noah’s day that seems similar to conditions in our day? In particular, look in\nMoses 8:15–24, 28\n. What themes do you see repeated?\nOne important similarity you’ll see is that God called Noah to be a prophet, and He has called a prophet today too. Consider making a list of truths you learn about prophets from\nMoses 8:13–30\n. How is our living prophet like Noah? Of course, the Lord’s prophet today isn’t warning of a Flood or inviting us to help build an ark. But what is he warning us about? And what is he inviting us to do? To help answer these questions, you could review a chapter from\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church\nin Gospel Library, especially the “Invitations and Promised Blessings” section. Perhaps you could pick one warning and one invitation that seem especially important to you.\nElder Allen D. Haynie taught, “A perfect and loving Father in Heaven has chosen the pattern of revealing truth to His children through a prophet” (“\nA Living Prophet for the Latter Days\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 25). Consider studying Elder Haynie’s message, looking for reasons having a prophet is a sign of Heavenly Father’s love. How has following the Lord’s prophet helped you feel safe living in the latter days?\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nProphets\n,” Gospel Library; “Why Do We Have Prophets?” (video), Gospel Library.\n1:37\nWhy Do We Have Prophets?\nGenesis 6:5–13\nThe Flood was an act of God’s mercy.\nSome people wonder about the justice of God in sending the Flood to “destroy man” (\nGenesis 6:7\n). Elder Neal A. Maxwell explained that at the time of the Flood, “corruption had reached an agency-destroying point that spirits could not, in justice, be sent here” (\nWe Will Prove Them Herewith\n[1982], 58). You might also consider how the Flood was an act of mercy. What do you find in\nGenesis 6:5–13\nthat shows the Lord’s tender mercy and love for the people?\nGenesis 9:8–17\nTokens or symbols help me remember my covenants with the Lord.\nAccording to\nGenesis 9:8–17\n, what can a rainbow bring to your mind? What does\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 9:21–25\n(in the Bible appendix) add to your understanding? You might also consider making a list of other things (like symbols, objects, or anything else) that God has given you to remind you of your covenants. What do these things teach you? How do they help you remember?\nSee also Gerrit W. Gong, “\nAlways Remember Him\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 108–11; “\nReverently and Meekly Now\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 185.\nThe Tower of Babel\n, by David Green\nGenesis 11:1–9\nFollowing Jesus Christ is the only way to Heavenly Father.\nThe account of the people of Babel building a tower provides an interesting contrast to the account of Enoch and his people building Zion, which you studied last week. Both groups of people were trying to reach heaven but in different ways. How did the people of Zion obtain heaven? (see\nMoses 7:18–19, 53, 62–63, 69\n). What do you learn from\nGenesis 11:1–9\nand\nHelaman 6:26–28\nabout the people of Babel? What does this teach us about our own efforts to return to God’s presence? What has God provided to help us “reach unto heaven”? (\nGenesis 11:4\n; see also\nJohn 3:16\n).\nLearn actively.\nLearning can involve more than just reading or listening. For example, when learning about the Tower of Babel, you and your family or class could write, on slips of paper, things that take us away from God. Then, on other slips of paper, you could write things that bring us nearer to God. Arrange the first group of papers in the shape of a tower and the second group in the shape of a temple.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhy did Noah curse Canaan?\nWhat was wrong about building the Tower of Babel?\nWhat is significant about the genealogy of Shem?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 6:14–22\n;\n7–8\n;\nMoses 8:16–24\nFollowing the Lord’s prophet will bless me and my family.\nMost children love the story of Noah and the ark. Consider giving your children opportunities to share what they know about it. To help them, you could use the pictures in this outline, “\nNoah and His Family\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n(22–25), and the third verse of “\nFollow the Prophet\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 110–11). Your children might enjoy acting out parts of the story—for example, by pretending to use a tool to build the ark or walking like animals entering the ark.\nAs you talk about Noah together, help your children see how blessed we are to have a prophet of God today. Help your children search\nMoses 8:16–24\nto find things Noah taught that the Lord’s prophets still teach today. How are we blessed when we obey these teachings?\nGenesis 9:15–16\nGod will keep His promises to me.\nYour children might enjoy drawing or coloring a rainbow while you talk about what it represents (see\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 9:21–25\n[in the Bible appendix]). What did God want Noah and his family to think of whenever they saw a rainbow?\nYou could also show your children something you have that reminds you of something important in your life, such as a wedding ring, a picture, or a journal. Let your children share their own examples. This could lead to a conversation about things that help us remember our covenants, such as the sacrament, which helps us remember our baptismal covenant to follow Jesus Christ (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:75–79\n).\nGod told Noah’s family that the rainbow would be “the token of the covenant which I make between me and you” (\nGenesis 9:12\n).\nGenesis 11:1–9\nFollowing Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven.\nIt could be fun to build a tower out of blocks or other objects with your children. As you do so, explain that the people of Babel thought they could get to heaven by building a tall tower. You could then look together at a picture of the Savior and ask your children how He helps us get to heaven. Then you could talk with each other about things you can do to follow the Savior.\nIn addition to reading the story of the tower of Babel in\nGenesis 11:1–9\n, you and your children could read\nHelaman 6:28\n. According to this verse, why did the people of Babel build the tower? Why was building this tower the wrong way to reach heaven? Then you could search\n2 Nephi 31:20–21\nand\nHelaman 3:28\nto find the right way to reach heaven. What advice would we give to the people of Babel?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Because of the covenant God made with him, Abraham has been called “the father of the faithful” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:41\n) and “the Friend of God” (\nJames 2:23\n). Millions today honor him as their direct ancestor, and others have been adopted into his family through conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Yet Abraham himself came from a troubled family—his father, who had abandoned the true worship of God, tried to have Abraham sacrificed to false gods. In spite of this, Abraham’s desire was “to be a greater follower of righteousness” (\nAbraham 1:2\n), and the account of his life shows that God honored his desire. Abraham’s life stands as a testimony that no matter what a person’s family history has been, the future can be filled with hope.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAbraham 1:1–19\nGod will bless me for my faith and righteous desires.\n“We are all influenced by our families [and] our culture,” Elder Neil L. Andersen taught, “and yet I believe there is a place inside of us that we uniquely and individually control and create. … Eventually, our inner desires are given life and they are seen in our choices and in our actions” (“\nEducate Your Desires, Elder Andersen Counsels\n,”\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). Consider how\nAbraham 1:1–19\ndemonstrates what Elder Andersen taught. Questions like these might help:\nWhat did Abraham desire? How were his desires evident in his actions? How did God support his desires?\nWhat are your desires? How are they evident in your actions? How does God support you?\nWhat message do these verses have for people whose family members do not desire righteousness?\nOne of Abraham and Sarah’s greatest desires—to have a child—went unfulfilled for many years (see\nGenesis 15:1–6\n). What do you learn from\nHebrews 11:8–13\nabout how Abraham and Sarah faced this trial? How does the Savior help you “embrace” His promises, even if they are “afar off”?\nSee also “Deliverance of Abraham” (video), Gospel Library.\n1:38\nDeliverance of Abraham\nGenesis 12:1–3\n;\n13:15–16\n;\n15:1–6\n;\n17:1–8, 15–22\n;\nAbraham 2:6–11\nGod wants me to make and keep covenants with Him.\nWhy is it important for you to know about the covenant God made with Abraham? Because God wants to make a similar covenant with you. He promised that this covenant would continue in Abraham’s posterity, or “seed,” and that “as many as receive this Gospel shall be … accounted thy seed” (see\nAbraham 2:10–11\n). In other words, the covenant continues in you—when you are baptized and more completely when you make covenants in the temple (see\nGalatians 3:26–29\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 132:30–32\n).\nFor that reason, you might want to study\nAbraham 2:6–11\nand make a list of what, exactly, God promised Abraham and Sarah (see also\nGenesis 12:1–3\n;\n13:15–16\n;\n15:1–6\n;\n17:1–8, 15–22\n). How might these blessings apply to you?\nSome of these promises have eternal parallels. How are promises like a land of inheritance or a large posterity fulfilled eternally? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 131:1–4\n;\n132:20–24, 28–32\n).\nBesides promising blessings, God told Abraham to “\nbe\na blessing” (\nGenesis 12:2\n; emphasis added). What do you think that means? How will\nyou\nbe a blessing? (see\nAbraham 2:11\n).\nTo teach about covenants, Elder Dale G. Renlund spoke of tidal waves in the Amazon River, and President Emily Belle Freeman talked about walking a rocky path with a broken ankle (see “\nAccessing God’s Power through Covenants\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 35–37; “\nWalking in Covenant Relationship with Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 76–79). Search one or both of these messages for sentences that help answer the question “Why does God want me to make covenants with Him?”\nInvite people to teach each other.\nIf you’re teaching your family or a Church class about covenants, consider giving each person a portion of Elder Renlund’s or President Freeman’s message to study. Then they could share with the rest of the family or class what they learned. This allows people to testify to and learn from each other, and that invites the Spirit.

        "content": "Abraham and Sarah’s life, filled with events both heartbreaking and heartwarming, is evidence of a truth Abraham learned in a vision—that we are on earth to be proven, “to see if [we] will do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command” (\nAbraham 3:25\n). Would Abraham and Sarah prove faithful? Would they continue to have faith in God’s promise of a large posterity, even when they were still childless in their old age? And once Isaac was born, would their faith endure the unthinkable—a command to sacrifice the very son through whom God had promised to fulfill that covenant?\nAbraham and Sarah trusted God, and He trusted them (see\nGenesis 15:6\n;\nRomans 4:3\n). In\nGenesis 18–23\n, we find stories from the lives of Abraham, Sarah, and others that can prompt us to think about our own willingness to believe God’s promises, to flee wickedness and never look back, and to trust God regardless of the sacrifice. In proving us, God also improves us.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 18:9–14\n;\n21:1–7\nThe Lord fulfills His promises in His own time.\nThe Lord has made glorious promises to the faithful, but sometimes the circumstances of our lives can cause us to wonder how these promises can possibly be fulfilled. Abraham and Sarah may have felt that way. What do you learn from their experiences? It may be helpful to begin your study by reviewing what the Lord had promised in\nGenesis 17:4, 15–22\n. How did Abraham and Sarah react? (see\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 17:23\n[in\nGenesis 17:17\n, footnote\nb\n];\nGenesis 18:9–12\n). How did the Lord respond to help them have greater faith in His promises? (see\nGenesis 18:14\n).\nWhat do you find in these verses that builds your faith? What other experiences—in your life or someone else’s—have strengthened your faith that the Lord will fulfill His promises in His own time and way? You might also ponder how you can sustain your faith when promised blessings are\nnot\nreceived in this life. What counsel do you find in\nHebrews 11:8–13\nand President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nChrist Is Risen; Faith in Him Will Move Mountains\n”? (\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 101–4).\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 88:68\n.\nGenesis 19:12–29\nThe Lord commands me to flee wickedness and not look back.\nWhat lessons do you learn about fleeing wickedness as you read about Lot and his family? For example, what impresses you about what the angels said and did to help Lot and his family escape destruction? (see\nGenesis 19:12–17\n). How does the Lord help you and your family flee or find protection from evil influences in the world? Think about situations where you may be tempted to “[look] back” (verse 26) when you ought to be looking forward with faith in the Savior. What does\nLuke 9:62\nadd to your understanding of this concept?\nSee also\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 19:9–15\n(in the Bible appendix).\nGenesis 19:26\nWhat did Lot’s wife do wrong?\nElder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:\n“Apparently, what was wrong with Lot’s wife was that she wasn’t just\nlooking\nback; in her heart she wanted to\ngo\nback. It would appear that even before she was past the city limits, she was already missing what Sodom and Gomorrah had offered her. …\n“It is possible that Lot’s wife looked back with resentment toward the Lord for what He was asking her to leave behind. … So it isn’t just that she looked back; she looked back\nlongingly.\nIn short, her attachment to the past outweighed her confidence in the future. That, apparently, was at least part of her sin.\n“… I plead with you not to dwell on days now gone nor to yearn vainly for yesterdays, however good those yesterdays may have been. The past is to be learned from but not lived in. We look back to claim the embers from glowing experiences but not the ashes. And when we have learned what we need to learn and have brought with us the best that we have experienced, then we look ahead and remember that\nfaith is always pointed toward the future\n. …\n“… Dwelling on past lives, including past mistakes, is just not right! It is not the gospel of Jesus Christ. …\n“To all [people] of every generation, I call out, ‘Remember Lot’s wife’ [\nLuke 17:32\n]. Faith is for the future. Faith builds on the past but never longs to stay there. Faith trusts that God has great things in store for each of us and that Christ truly is the ‘high priest of good things to come’ (\nHebrews 9:11\n)” (“\nThe Best Is Yet to Be\n,”\nEnsign\n, Jan. 2010, 24, 26–27).\nAbraham and Isaac\n, by Harold Copping\nGenesis 22:1–19\nAbraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac is a similitude of God and His Son.\nAlthough we don’t know all the reasons God commanded Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice, we do know it was a test of his faith in God. We also know it was “a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son” (\nJacob 4:5\n). As you read\nGenesis 22:1–19\n, you could look for symbols or similarities between Abraham’s offering of Isaac and the Father’s offering of His Son, Jesus Christ. Consider writing what you find in a chart like this:\nAbraham and Isaac\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ\nAbraham and Isaac\nIsaac was the only begotten son of Abraham and Sarah (\nGenesis 22:2\n; see also\nHebrews 11:17\n)\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ\nJesus is the Only Begotten of the Father (\nJohn 3:16\n)\nAbraham and Isaac\nIsaac was to be offered in place of a lamb (\nGenesis 22:7–9\n)\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ\nJesus Christ is the Lamb of God (\nJohn 1:29\n)\nWhat symbols or similarities to the Savior’s atoning sacrifice do you find most meaningful? Consider singing or reading the lyrics of a hymn that shows Heavenly Father’s love for us, such as “\nGod Loved Us, So He Sent His Son\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 187. You might also record your feelings about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and Their sacrifice for you.\nIf you want to study more about the sacrifice of our Savior, consider reading President Jeffrey R. Holland’s message “\nBehold the Lamb of God\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 44–46). Why is a lamb such a powerful symbol of the Son of God? What did President Holland teach that increases your reverence for Heavenly Father’s gift?\nSee also “Akedah (The Binding)” (video), Gospel Library.\n12:57\nAkedah (The Binding)\nUse visuals to teach.\nTo add variety in teaching and learning, you might use one or more of the pictures in this outline as you study the stories in\nGenesis 18–23\n. For example, you and your family or class could note details in the pictures of Abraham and Isaac. Talk about why these details are important to the story, and find these details in the scriptures. How do they highlight the story’s symbolism of the sacrifice of the Son of God?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nDid Lot offer his daughters to the abuses of a mob?\nWhy did God destroy Sodom and Gomorrah?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 17:15–21\n;\n18:14\n;\n21:1–7\nI can trust God to keep His promises.\nTo learn about Abraham and Sarah’s trust in God’s promises, you and your children could talk about a time when they had to wait for something they really wanted. You could then look at the picture of Sarah and Isaac at the beginning of this outline and talk about the promise God made to her and Abraham (see also “\nAbraham and Sarah,\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 28–31). Help your children think of things that God has promised us if we are faithful. Encourage them to be patient and trust that God will keep His promises.\n2:20\nAbraham and Sarah\nTo help your children learn the important truth in\nGenesis 18:14\n, you could write each word from the first sentence of that verse on separate pieces of paper. Then mix the papers up, and invite your children to put the words in the correct order. You and your children could then read\nGenesis 17:15–21\n;\n21:1–7\nto find an example of something the Lord did that seemed impossible. Share with your children your faith that the Lord will fulfill His promises, even if they seem impossible or take a long time.\nGenesis 19:15–26\nI can flee wickedness.\nAsk your children about situations in which someone might invite them to do something they know isn’t right. How would we “flee” these situations? Summarize\nGenesis 19:15–26\nby explaining that Lot’s family lived in a very wicked city and angels warned them to leave. As you and your children read together\nverses 15–17, 26\n, ask them what it might mean for us today to “escape” evil and “look not behind” (\nverse 17\n).\nSodom\n, by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld\nGenesis 22:1–14\nAbraham obeyed the Lord.\nUsing pictures of Abraham and Isaac and of the Crucifixion (see\nGospel Art Book,\nnos. 9\n,\n57\n) can help your children compare the story in\nGenesis 22\nwith the Savior’s sacrifice (see\nMatthew 27:26–37\n). What can we learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from the accounts of Abraham and Isaac and of the Crucifixion? (See also “\nAbraham and Isaac\n,” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 34–37.)\n2:0\nAbraham and Isaac\nCan you think of a simple game to play with your children that requires them to follow directions? Maybe the directions could lead to a hidden picture of the Savior. The game could prompt a conversation about things Heavenly Father has commanded us to do so we can live with Him and Jesus Christ again. Consider singing a song such as “\nKeep the Commandments\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 146–47). This week’s activity page could help as well.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "How do you secure for yourself a blessing from God? You might say that the account of Jacob, grandson of Abraham and Sarah, is the story of a man who learned the answer to that question. In a culture where the firstborn son received a birthright blessing, Jacob was born second, grasping the heel of his twin brother, Esau. The name “Jacob” means “supplanter”—one who replaces someone else. Jacob lived up to that name by trying, more than once, to supplant Esau as inheritor of the birthright blessing because Esau was unworthy of it (see\nGenesis 25:30–34\n;\n26:34–35\n;\n27:36\n). The result was discord in the family, and Jacob had to flee for his life into the wilderness.\nYears later, God commanded Jacob to return home. On the way, Jacob, in humility, again sought a blessing from God. The scriptures describe this time as a “wrestle” for Jacob, and he declared that he would not give up “except thou bless me” (\nGenesis 32:26\n). Then came the lesson—and the blessing. God changed Jacob’s name to Israel—meaning, among other things, “let God prevail.” Israel learned that to receive God’s most valuable blessings, His covenant blessings, it’s not necessary to supplant someone else. His blessings aren’t purchased or seized or won. He gives them freely to all who live up to the name of Israel—who let God prevail in their lives.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 24\nCovenant marriage is essential to God’s eternal plan.\nWhile reading\nGenesis 24\n, ask yourself why Abraham considered the marriage of his son Isaac to be so important. Why is marriage important to God?\nWhat qualities do you find in Rebekah that would contribute to a strong marriage and family? (see especially\nverses 15–28, 57–61\n).\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nMarriage\n,” Gospel Library.\nGenesis 25:29–34\nI can value eternal things over temporal things.\nIn Isaac and Rebekah’s culture, the oldest son received the birthright, which meant a greater inheritance, along with greater responsibilities for caring for the family. As you read\nGenesis 25:29–34\n, ponder why Esau might have been willing to give up his birthright in exchange for a meal. What lessons do you find for yourself in this account? It might help to make two lists: (1) eternal blessings God wants to give you and (2) worldly things that might distract you. Then you could read the passage, replacing “birthright” with something from the first list and “pottage” with something from the second. How will you focus on the Savior and the eternal blessings of His gospel?\nSee also\nMatthew 6:19–33\n; M. Russell Ballard, “\nRemember What Matters Most\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 105–7.\nJacob at Bethel\n, by James Smetham\nGenesis 28\nThe covenants of the Lord’s house bring God’s power into my life.\nWhile sleeping on a pillow of stones, Jacob had a life-changing dream. It was such a sacred experience that Jacob named the place Bethel, or “house of God,” declaring, “Surely the Lord is in this place” (\nGenesis 28:16\n).\nAs you read\nGenesis 28\n, you might ask yourself what made this experience so sacred to Jacob. What was he going through at the time? How might he have been feeling? You could also look for words and phrases in\nverses 10–22\nthat remind you of the house of the Lord. What impressions do you receive about God, His house, and His covenants?\nAt the end of this outline is a painting that depicts Jacob’s dream; you might refer to it as you read. If you were to create your own artistic depiction of his dream, what would you do? What truths from the story would you try to portray?\nThe hymn “\nNearer, My God, to Thee\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 100) is based on Jacob’s experience. What connections do you see between this song and\nGenesis 28:10–22\n? How does the temple help you feel nearer to God? Consider looking for answers to this question in President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nThe Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 93–96). You may also want to review the covenants and blessings of the house of the Lord in\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n27.2\n(Gospel Library). How does keeping these covenants bring God’s power into your life?\nBe creative.\nThere are many ways to learn from the scriptures besides just reading them. Some people find that they understand the scriptures better if they draw pictures of the accounts. Others find spiritual insights in sacred music related to the scriptures. Don’t limit yourself to one way of learning; be open to trying a variety of approaches.\nGenesis 29:31–35\n;\n30:1–24\nThe Lord remembers me in my trials.\nAs you read\nGenesis 29:31–35\nand\n30:1–24\n, look for words describing God’s mercy to Rachel and Leah. Ponder how God has “looked upon [your] affliction” and “remembered” you (\nGenesis 29:32\n;\n30:22\n).\nGenesis 32–33\nThe Savior can heal my family.\nAs Jacob returned to Canaan, he was “greatly afraid and distressed” about how his brother, Esau, would receive him (\nGenesis 32:7\n). As you read\nGenesis 32–33\n, ponder your own family relationships—perhaps especially one that needs healing. Maybe this story could inspire you to reach out to someone. Questions like these could guide your reading:\nHow did Jacob prepare to meet Esau?\nWhat stands out to you about Jacob’s prayer found in\nGenesis 32:9–12\n?\nWhat do you learn about forgiveness from Esau’s example?\nHow can the Savior help us heal family relationships?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhy did Abraham not want Isaac to marry a Canaanite?\nWhy did Jacob pretend to be Esau?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 24:10–21\nI can be kind to others.\nTo highlight Rebekah’s impressive example of kindness, you could show your children the picture below or this week’s activity page as you summarize the story in\nGenesis 24:10–21\n. Your children might enjoy acting out the story. This could lead to a conversation about acts of kindness you and your children have seen.\nConsider singing a song about kindness together, such as “\nKindness Begins with Me\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 145). Your children could listen for the word “kindness” (or a similar word) and stand when they hear it. How can we be kind like Rebekah?\nOld Testament Heroes\n, by Dilleen Marsh (detail)\nGenesis 25:21–34\nEternal things are more important than worldly things.\nConsider using “\nJacob and Esau\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 38–41) to help your children understand the story in\nGenesis 25:21–34\n. Maybe your children could imagine that Esau asked for their advice about whether he should trade his birthright for the pottage. What would they say to him?\n2:5\nJacob and Esau\nWhat things matter eternally to you and your children? Perhaps your children could find pictures or objects that represent these things. How can we show the Lord that these things are important to us?\nGenesis 28:10–22\nCovenants help me return to Heavenly Father.\nAs you read\nGenesis 28:10–22\ntogether, you could use a ladder or a staircase (or a picture like the one at the end of this outline) to talk about how our covenants are like a ladder. Maybe your children could pretend to climb a ladder, and with each step, talk about times when we promise to obey God, such as when we are baptized, take the sacrament, or go to the temple. How do our covenants bring us closer to God?\nGenesis 32:6–11\n;\n33:1–4\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ can help me love my family.\nTo introduce these verses, you might explain that after many years of hard feelings, Jacob was going to meet Esau again. Read together\nGenesis 32:6–11\n. How did Jacob feel? What did he do to get help? Read together\nGenesis 33:1–4\nto discover how the Lord answered Jacob’s prayer. If Jacob and Esau could talk to us today, what might they say to help us when there is contention in our family?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "We know that God blesses people who trust Him and keep His commandments. But sometimes it doesn’t seem that way. Sometimes the person who trusts God is abused and abandoned by family members. Sometimes the person who bravely refuses to violate the law of chastity gets falsely accused anyway. When things like that happen to us, we might be tempted to become angry with God. We might wonder, “What’s the point of trying to do the right thing if it only seems to make life harder?”\nJoseph, the son of Jacob, could have wondered that. At times, this faithful man prospered; at other times, it seemed that the more faithful he was, the more hardship he faced. But Joseph never left the Lord, and the Lord never left Joseph. That doesn’t mean the Lord prevented bad things from happening to Joseph, but through it all, “the Lord was with him” (\nGenesis 39:3\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 37:1–28\n;\n39\n;\n41:9–45\nThe Lord will be with me in my adversity.\nTime and again, good fortune seemed to abandon Joseph, but the Lord never did. As you read Joseph’s story, ponder questions such as these: What did Joseph do to stay close to the Lord? How was the Lord “with him”? (see\nGenesis 39\n;\n40:1–19\n;\n41:9–45\n). What do you learn from Joseph’s story that could help you recognize the Lord’s presence in your life?\nYou might also ask similar questions about your life. What evidence have you seen that the Lord has not forsaken you in times of trial? Consider how you can share your experiences with family members and future generations (see\n1 Nephi 5:14\n).\nOf course, you will have other trials in the future. What can you do now to help ensure that these trials don’t pull you away from the Lord? Consider writing a letter to encourage your future self to stay close to Him no matter what. You might include insights from Joseph’s life or from President D. Todd Christofferson’s message “\nOur Relationship with God\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 78–81).\nSee also\nJohn 14:18\n;\nRomans 8:28\n;\nAlma 36:3\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:7–8\n; “\nAbide with Me!\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 166.\nGenesis 37:5–11\n;\n40\n;\n41:1–38\nIf I am faithful, the Lord will guide and inspire me.\nJoseph had a gift for discerning messages from the Lord through dreams. What can you learn from\nGenesis 37:5–11\n;\n40:5–8\n;\n41:14–25, 37–38\nabout receiving and understanding revelation from the Lord? For instance, what can you learn from Joseph’s example when revelation seems difficult to understand? (see\nGenesis 40:8\n;\n41:16\n).\nPonder how the Lord is revealing His will to you. What are you doing to act on revelation He has given you? How are you seeking additional guidance from Him?’\nJoseph Interpreting the Butler and Baker’s Dreams\n, by François Gérard\nGenesis 39:1–20\nWith the Lord’s help, I can flee temptation.\nIf Joseph were to give counsel on how to resist temptation to commit sexual sin, what do you think he would say? Think about this as you read about his experience in\nGenesis 39\n. For example, consider how Joseph might respond to concerns like these:\nIf no one else knows what I’m doing, what’s the big deal? (see\nverses 8–9\n).\nI try to resist, but the temptation just doesn’t seem to stop (see\nverse 10\n).\nWhat should I do when I’m in a situation where temptation is strong? (see\nverse 12\n).\nHow would you explain why obeying the law of chastity is important? (see\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n,\n23–28\n).\nJoseph’s example, of course, can apply to other kinds of temptation. With Joseph’s experience in mind, consider making a plan for avoiding and resisting temptation. For example, you could think of a temptation and write down situations to avoid and how you will “flee” when the temptation arises.\nTemptation\nSituations to avoid\nPlan to respond\nHere are some other scriptures that could inform your plan. What do you learn from each about how the Savior can help you resist temptation?\nMatthew 4:1–11\n;\n1 Corinthians 10:13\n;\n1 Nephi 15:23–24\n;\n3 Nephi 18:17–18\n.\nAs you make your plan, it might also help to think about times in the past when you successfully avoided or resisted temptation. How did the Savior help you? (see\n2 Nephi 4:18–33\n).\nGenesis 41:15–57\nThe Lord will help me prepare for possible hardships.\nJoseph’s interpretation of Pharaoh’s dream led to some very wise and practical counsel for surviving a famine (see\nGenesis 41:15–57\n). Consider what spiritual messages the Lord might have for you in this account. How do you feel He wants you to prepare for hardships in your future?\nSee also David A. Bednar, “\nWe Will Prove Them Herewith\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 8–11.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nHow was Joseph similar to Jesus Christ?\nWhat does the Book of Mormon teach about Joseph’s coat?\nWhat do we understand about what took place between Judah and Tamar?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 37\nI can be kind to my family.\nReading about the hard feelings in Joseph’s family could prompt a discussion about how we should treat family members. To tell the story of Joseph and his brothers from\nGenesis 37\n, you could use the pictures in this outline or in “\nJoseph’s Inspired Dreams\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 47–51). Let your children share details they know about the story. You might ask your children to imagine they were in Joseph’s family. What would they have said or done to be a peacemaker in the family? For example, what does it mean to “speak peaceably” in our family? (\nverse 4\n). How is Jesus Christ a peacemaker in God’s family?\n2:17\nJoseph’s Inspired Dreams\nGenesis 37:18–28\n;\n39:20–23\n;\n41:38\nGod can help me when bad things happen.\nWhen your children face hard times, they need to know that the Lord will be with them, as He was with Joseph. Perhaps you could help your children make a list of hard things that happened to Joseph (see\nGenesis 37:23–28\n;\n39:20\n; or “\nJoseph’s Inspired Dreams\n” and “\nJoseph in Egypt\n,” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 47–51, 52–56). After each hardship they find, invite your children to repeat, “The Lord was with Joseph” (\nGenesis 39:2\n).\n2:17\nJoseph’s Inspired Dreams\n2:50\nJoseph in Egypt\nPerhaps your children could search\nGenesis 39:1–3, 20–23\nfor every instance of the phrase “The Lord was with Joseph” and similar phrases. Let them share what they think this phrase means. How do we know that the Lord is with us? Tell each other about how you felt God was with you during a challenging time.\nJoseph of Egypt in Prison\n, by Jeff Ward (detail)\nGenesis 39:7–12\nWith the Lord’s help, I can flee temptation.\nHere’s an object lesson that can help your children follow Joseph’s example of fleeing from Potiphar’s wife: Use two magnets to represent Jesus Christ and Satan. Use a small metal object, like a paper clip, to represent us. Then let your children see how the influence of a magnet on the metal object is stronger when they move the object closer to it. How does Joseph’s experience in\nGenesis 39:7–12\nillustrate this truth? What can we do to move away from sin and closer to Jesus? The video “Temptation Fades as We Seek Christ in Every Thought” (Gospel Library) and a song like “\nI Need Thee Every Hour\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 98) can help with this discussion.\n2:58\nTemptation Fades as We Seek Christ in Every Thought\nUse music.\n“Hymns and other sacred songs can help children feel God’s love, feel the Spirit, and learn gospel truths. The melodies, rhythms, and simple rhymes can help children remember gospel truths for years to come. As you sing with children, help them discover and understand the principles taught in the songs” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n32\n).\nHelp your children think of temptations they might face.

        "content": "It had been about 22 years since Joseph’s brothers sold him into slavery. Joseph had suffered many trials, including false accusations and imprisonment. When he finally saw his brothers again, Joseph was the governor of all Egypt, second only to the pharaoh. He could easily have taken revenge on his brothers, and considering what they had done to Joseph, that might seem understandable. And yet Joseph forgave them. Not only that, but he helped them see divine purpose in his suffering. “God meant it unto good” (\nGenesis 50:20\n), he told them, because it put him in a position to save “all his father’s household” (\nGenesis 47:12\n) from famine.\nIn many ways, Joseph was like Jesus Christ. Even though our sins caused Jesus great suffering, He offers forgiveness, delivering all of us from a fate far worse than famine. Whether we need to receive forgiveness or extend it—at some point we all need to do both—Joseph’s example points us to the Savior, the true source of healing and reconciliation.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 45:5–7\n;\n47:12\n“God sent me before you to preserve you.”\nHave you noticed any similarities between Joseph’s life and the atoning mission of Jesus Christ? To see some examples of these similarities, try comparing:\nGenesis 37:3\nwith\nMatthew 3:17\n.\nGenesis 37:26–28\nwith\nMatthew 26:14–16\n.\nGenesis 45:5–7\nwith\nLuke 4:18\n.\nGenesis 47:12\nwith\nJohn 6:35\n.\nWhat impressions do you have about the Savior and His mission as you read these passages?\nGenesis 45\n;\n50:15–21\nForgiveness brings healing.\nReading about Joseph forgiving his brothers of the terrible things they had done may prompt you to think about someone you are currently struggling to forgive. The following questions may help as you strive to apply this principle:\nWhy might it have been hard for Joseph to forgive his brothers? (to review what they did to him, see\nGenesis 37\n). What experiences or attitudes might have given Joseph the strength to forgive? (see, for example,\nGenesis 45:1–15\nor\n50:15–21\n).\nWhat blessings came from Joseph’s forgiveness of his brothers? For example, compare the relationships in Jacob’s family at the beginning of the story (see, for example,\nGenesis 37:3–11\n) with the relationships at the end (see\nGenesis 45:9–15\n;\n50:15–21\n). How might things have turned out differently if Joseph had not been willing to forgive?\nConsider writing down the name of someone who may need your forgiveness—whether or not they have asked for forgiveness. What can you do to invite the Savior’s healing power into that situation? If forgiving seems too difficult, consider reviewing the counsel of Elder Gerrit W. Gong in the last six paragraphs of his message “\nHappy and Forever\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 85). What do you find that gives you hope that you can forgive?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:9–11\n; “Forgiveness: My Burden Was Made Light” (video), Gospel Library.\n8:24\nForgiveness: My Burden Was Made Light\nGenesis 49\nJacob gave his family prophetic blessings.\nJacob’s blessings to his posterity contain vivid imagery, but they aren’t easy to understand. Thankfully, the restored gospel gives us some help. When you read the blessing to Joseph in\nGenesis 49:22–26\n, read the following verses too, and see what insights they provide:\n1 Nephi 15:12\n;\n2 Nephi 3:4–5\n;\nJacob 2:25\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:44\n.\nAs you read about Judah’s blessing in\nGenesis 49:8–12\n, remember that Jesus Christ was a descendant of Judah. What do you find in these verses that reminds you of the Savior? (see also\nRevelation 5:5–6, 9\n;\n1 Nephi 15:14–15\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:59\n;\n133:46–50\n).\nReading these blessings might inspire you to review your patriarchal blessing—or, if you don’t have one, to receive one. What words and phrases in your blessing turn your thoughts to Jesus Christ?\nSee also Randall K. Bennett, “\nYour Patriarchal Blessing—Inspired Direction from Heavenly Father\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 42–44.\nGenesis 50:19–21\nGod can help me find meaning in my trials.\nThough it may not have been clear while he was going through it, Joseph was eventually able to look back on his adversity in Egypt and see that “God meant it unto good” (\nGenesis 50:20\n). If you could have visited Joseph while he was in the pit or in prison, how would you have comforted him? How can\nGenesis 50:19–21\nhelp you in your times of trial?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 122\n; “\nHow Firm a Foundation\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 85.\nJoseph Smith among the Prophets\n, by Paul Mann (detail)\nGenesis 50:24–25\n“A seer shall the Lord my God raise up.”\nAs you read\nGenesis 50:24–25\nand\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 50:24–38\n(in the Bible appendix), ponder why it would have been important for Joseph to know about Moses and Joseph Smith so many centuries in advance. How did Joseph Smith fulfill Joseph’s prophecies about him? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:17–23\n;\n20:7–12\n;\n39:11\n;\n135:3\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhy did Joseph test his brothers?\nWhy did Jacob adopt Joseph’s two sons?\nWhy did Jacob place his right hand on Ephraim instead of Manasseh?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 42–44\n;\n45:4–15\nI can show love and forgiveness to my family.\nIt might be fun for your children to reenact the story of Joseph reuniting his family (see\nGenesis 42–44\n). Or they could use “\nJoseph and the Famine\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 57–60) or pictures in this outline to teach the story to each other. Here are some questions that could help your children learn from the story:\nWhat did Joseph do to show love for his family? (see\nGenesis 45:4–15\n).\nWhy do you feel Joseph forgave his brothers?\nHow do you think Joseph’s brothers felt when they found out Joseph had forgiven them? Who in your life needs to be forgiven? How can you show love and forgiveness?\n2:26\nJoseph and the Famine\nAs you prepare to teach, ask, “What will my children do to learn?”\nFor example, in this activity your children are acting out or retelling a story. Doing this will help them remember both what happened and the gospel principles contained in the story.\nYou or your children may want to share an experience when they forgave someone or when someone forgave them. You could then sing a song such as “\nLove One Another\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 136) or “\nHelp Me, Dear Father\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 99).\nGenesis 48:8–9\nThe Lord helps me through priesthood blessings.\nYou and your children could look at the picture of Jacob blessing his sons at the end of this outline and discuss what is happening (see\nGenesis 48:8–9\n). If needed, explain that Jacob, Joseph’s father, wanted to give priesthood blessings to his family. Perhaps you could share with each other any experiences you’ve had receiving help from God through a priesthood blessing. What are some reasons we might ask for a priesthood blessing?\nGenesis 45:5–11\nHeavenly Father sent Jesus Christ to save me.\nHow can you help your children see the Savior in the story of Joseph saving his family from famine? Consider making a chart with two columns labeled\nJoseph\nand\nJesus Christ\n. Help your children search the following pairs of scriptures and fill in the chart with things that Joseph and Jesus have in common:\nGenesis 37:3\nand\nMatthew 3:17\n;\nGenesis 37:26–28\nand\nMatthew 26:14–16\n;\nGenesis 45:5–7\nand\nLuke 4:18\n; and\nGenesis 47:12\nand\nJohn 6:35\n.\nAsk your children what it means to save or rescue someone. If any of them have had an experience being saved or rescued from danger, invite them to share. How did Joseph save his brothers? (see\nGenesis 42:1–3\n;\n45:5–7\n). Then you could look at a picture of the Savior together and ask your children to talk about how Jesus saves us.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "The invitation to live in Egypt saved Jacob’s family. But after hundreds of years, their descendants were enslaved and terrorized by a new pharaoh who “knew not Joseph” (\nExodus 1:8\n). It would have been natural for the Israelites to wonder why God allowed this to happen to them, His covenant people. Did He remember the covenant He had made with them? Were they still His people? Could He see how much they were suffering?\nThere may be times when you’ve felt like asking similar questions. You might wonder, “Does God know what I’m going through? Can He hear my pleas for help?” Israel’s deliverance from Egypt answers such questions clearly: God does not forget His people. He remembers His covenants with us and will fulfill them in His own time and way. “I will redeem you with a stretched out arm,” He declares. “I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under [your] burdens” (\nExodus 6:6–7\n).\nFor an overview of the book of Exodus, see “\nExodus, book of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and Church\nExodus 1–2\nGod can work through me to fulfill His purposes.\nWhat impresses you about the women described in\nExodus 1–2\n? How did they help fulfill God’s plan for His people? What do their efforts teach you about service in God’s work?\nExodus 1–3\nJesus Christ is my Deliverer.\nBefore you begin reading Exodus, you might think about a hardship you’re going through—something you hope the Lord will deliver you from. What words and phrases in\nExodus 1–3\nsound similar to spiritual captivity or other things we face today? Notice also how the children of Israel sought deliverance and how the Lord responded (see, for example,\nExodus 2:23–25\n;\n3:7–8\n). How has the Lord “come down to deliver” you?\nThroughout the book of Exodus, you might also note some similarities between Moses and Jesus Christ (see\nDeuteronomy 18:18–19\n;\n1 Nephi 22:20–21\n). For example, what similarities do you see between\nExodus 1:22\n;\n2:1–10\nand\nMatthew 2:13–16\n? Or between\nExodus 24:18\nand\nMatthew 4:1–2\n? What do you feel the Lord wants you to understand about Himself and His power?\nLook for symbols that testify of Jesus Christ.\n“You can … find parallels to the Savior’s life in the lives of prophets and other faithful men and women in the scriptures. [Doing so] reveals truths about the Savior in places you might otherwise overlook” (See\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n7\n; see also\nHosea 12:10\n).\nFaith at Water’s Edge\n, by Anne Marie Oborn\nExodus 3:1–6\nI can show reverence for holy things and places.\nCan you think of a time when something filled you with awe and wonder? How did you react? How would you describe the emotions you felt?\nWith that in mind, read\nExodus 3:1–6\n. What impresses you about Moses’s inspiring experience? What did Moses do to show reverence for God? What connections do you see between his actions and reverence for sacred things?\nReading these verses might prompt you to think about holy things and holy places in your life. Why are they sacred to you? How do you treat them differently from things that are common? To guide your pondering, you could refer to the section titled “\nRemembering the Promises\n” in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “Exceeding Great and Precious Promises” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 91–93). You might also sing or listen to a hymn that inspires awe, like “\nI Stand All Amazed\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 193) and ponder what it is about the gospel that amazes you.\nOf course, even when we’ve had wonderful spiritual experiences, there’s a danger of becoming too casual about sacred things. How do you avoid this? Here are two messages that address this issue; pick one, and look for statements that help you: Ulisses Soares, “\nIn Awe of Christ and His Gospel\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 115–17); Gérald Caussé, “\nIs It Still Wonderful to You?\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 98–100).\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:10–12\n;\n63:64\n.\nExodus 3–4\nGod gives power to people He calls to do His work.\nToday we know Moses as a great prophet and leader. But Moses did not see himself that way when the Lord first called him. As you read\nExodus 3–4\n, list Moses’s concerns and how the Lord responded to each. What do you find in these chapters that might inspire you when you feel inadequate? When have you seen God empower you or others to do His work?\nSee also “\nThe Church Gives Us Opportunities to Assist in God’s Work\n” in “Church Organization” in Topics and Questions, Gospel Library.\nExodus 5–6\nThe Lord’s purposes will be fulfilled in His own time.\nIt can be discouraging when our sincere efforts to do good don’t seem to be working—when we’re trying to do the Lord’s will but we’re not seeing the results we expected. To learn about a similar experience Moses had, read\nExodus 5:4–9, 20–23\n. How did the Lord help Moses overcome his feelings of discouragement? (see\nExodus 6:1–13\n). How has the Lord helped you persist in doing His will?\nSee also Jeffrey R. Holland, “\nWaiting on the Lord\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 115–17.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhy did Moses slay an Egyptian?\nWho was Jethro?\nWhat can we learn about the glory of God from the burning bush?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nExodus 1–2\nGod can work through me to fulfill His purposes.\nMoses had a major role in freeing Israel from bondage. But he wouldn’t have been able to accomplish this if his mother, his sister, Pharaoh’s daughter, and other faithful women hadn’t protected and cared for him. Help your children learn about these women in\nExodus 1:15–20\n;\nExodus 2:2–10\n(see also\nNumbers 26:59\n); and\nExodus 2:16–21\n. You could also use this week’s activity page and “\nBaby Moses\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 61–63) to tell their stories. How did these women help fulfill God’s plan? Talk with each other about other people you admire who help with God’s work, including in small and simple ways. How can we follow their example?\n1:36\nBaby Moses\nExodus 3:1–5\nI can treat holy places with reverence.\nAfter reading\nExodus 3:1–5\ntogether, ask your children to summarize these verses in their own words (see also “\nMoses the Prophet\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 64–66). You could also review the beginning of Elder Ulisses Soares’s message “\nReverence for Sacred Things\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2025, 108). How did Moses show reverence in the Lord’s presence? How does the Lord want us to show reverence? You might also ask your children to help you find (or draw) pictures of sacred places or activities where we should be reverent. What can we do to make our home a sacred place?\n1:26\nMoses the Prophet\nSing together a song about reverence, such as “\nReverence Is Love\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 31). As you do, your children could find words or phrases that explain what it means to be reverent. If we were bringing a friend to church for the first time, how would we explain what it means to be reverent?\nMoses and Aaron Speak to the People\n, by James J. Tissot\nExodus 3–4\nWhen the Lord asks me to do something, He will help me do it.\nUsing the account in\nExodus 3\n;\n4:1–17\n, let your children take turns pretending to be Moses. It might be fun to include objects or simple props, such as a flashlight and a plant to represent the burning bush. Help your children discover how Moses felt about the assignment the Lord gave him (see\nExodus 3:11\n;\n4:1, 10\n). Maybe you could share with each other times when you had similar feelings. What advice would we share with Moses to help him? Read about how the Lord encouraged Moses in\nExodus 3:12\n;\n4:2–9, 11–12\n. Tell the children how the Savior has helped you fulfill a calling, follow a prompting, or do something else that was hard for you.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "title": "Easter",
        "content": "The life of Jesus Christ “is central to all human history” (“\nThe Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles\n,” Gospel Library). What does that mean? In part, it means that the Savior’s life influences the eternal destiny of everyone who has ever lived or ever will live. You might also say that the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, on that first Easter Sunday, connects all of God’s people throughout history: those who were born before His Resurrection looked forward to it with faith (see\nJacob 4:4\n), and those born after look back on it with faith. As we read Old Testament accounts and prophecies, we don’t ever see the name Jesus Christ, but we do see the evidence of the ancient believers’ faith in and longing for their Messiah and Redeemer. So we who are invited to\nremember\nHim can feel a connection with those who\nlooked forward\nto Him. For truly Jesus Christ has borne “the iniquity of us\nall\n” (\nIsaiah 53:6\n; emphasis added), and “in Christ shall\nall\nbe made alive” (\n1 Corinthians 15:22\n; emphasis added).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nProphets ancient and modern testify of the Savior’s atoning sacrifice.\nMany passages in the Old Testament point to the Savior’s ministry and atoning sacrifice. The table below lists some of these passages. As you read these verses, what impressions come to you about the Savior?\nOld Testament\nNew Testament\nOld Testament\nZechariah 9:9\nNew Testament\nMatthew 21:1–11\nOld Testament\nZechariah 11:12–13\nNew Testament\nMatthew 26:14–16\n;\n27:3–8\nOld Testament\nIsaiah 53:4\nNew Testament\nMatthew 8:16–17\n;\n26:36–39\nOld Testament\nIsaiah 53:7\nNew Testament\nMark 14:60–61\nOld Testament\nPsalm 22:16\nNew Testament\nJohn 19:17–18\n;\n20:25–27\nOld Testament\nPsalm 22:18\nNew Testament\nMatthew 27:35\nOld Testament\nPsalm 69:21\nNew Testament\nMatthew 27:34, 48\nOld Testament\nPsalm 118:22\nNew Testament\nMatthew 21:42\nOld Testament\nIsaiah 53:9, 12\nNew Testament\nMatthew 27:57–60\n;\nMark 15:27–28\nOld Testament\nIsaiah 25:8\nNew Testament\nMark 16:1–6\n;\nLuke 24:6\nOld Testament\nDaniel 12:2\nNew Testament\nMatthew 27:52–53\nProphecies that teach about the Savior are even more abundant and clear in the Book of Mormon. Consider how your faith is strengthened by passages like these:\n1 Nephi 11:31–33\n;\n2 Nephi 25:13\n;\nMosiah 3:2–11\n;\nAlma 7:10–13\n.\nLatter-day prophets continue to bear special witness of Jesus Christ and His atoning mission. As you listen to general conference this Easter weekend, make note of testimonies of Christ that you hear. What do they teach you about Him?\nJesus Christ offers me peace and joy.\nEaster is a joyful time, because it’s a time to celebrate the Savior’s Atonement and Resurrection. And yet, even during Easter, there are many people who don’t feel joyful for various reasons. What can you do to spread the Savior’s peace and joy this Easter?\nOne idea is to find messages in the scriptures about the peace and joy Jesus Christ offers, like these:\nPsalms 16:8–11\n;\n30:2–5\n;\nIsaiah 12\n;\n25:8–9\n;\n40:28–31\n;\nJohn 14:27\n;\n16:33\n;\nAlma 26:11–22\n. Consider how you might share these messages with others. For example, maybe you could create Easter cards to share, based on these messages. Be prayerful about who needs to receive your Easter greeting. You might also decide to share your messages on social media, where many people can see them.\nHymns about Christ and the Resurrection, such as “\nHe Is Risen!\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 199), can also help us feel peace and joy at Easter. Look for phrases in the hymn that, in your opinion, capture the joy of Easter.\nSee also Jeffrey R. Holland, “\nNot as the World Giveth\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 35–38; Mark S. Palmer, “\nOur Sorrow Shall Be Turned into Joy\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 88–90.\nWhy Weepest Thou\n, by Simon Dewey (detail)\nBecause of His Atonement, Jesus Christ has the power to help me overcome sin, death, trials, and weaknesses.\nHere’s an activity that can help you see the many blessings that come through Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Read the scriptures below about what Jesus Christ helps us overcome. Try sorting the passages into these categories: sin, death, trials, and weaknesses (some passages may fit in more than one category). As you read, what impressions do you have about the Savior’s power?\nIsaiah 61:1–3\nEzekiel 36:26–28\nMatthew 11:28–30\nLuke 1:46–55\nRomans 8:35–39\nAlma 7:10–13\nAlma 11:42–45\nAlma 58:11\nMoroni 10:32–33\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:15–19\nMoses 5:9–12\nHow would you explain to a friend who isn’t a Christian why Jesus Christ is important to you? Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt’s message “\nDo You Know Why I as a Christian Believe in Christ?\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 119–21) can help.\nSee also Reyna I. Aburto, “\nThe Grave Has No Victory\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 85–87; Topics and Questions, “\nAtonement of Jesus Christ\n,” “\nResurrection\n,” Gospel Library.\nJesus Christ paid the ultimate price for my salvation.\nWhat do you learn from the following verses about the price Jesus Christ paid for your salvation:\nIsaiah 53:3–5\n;\nMosiah 3:7\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:16–19\n? What price did Heavenly Father pay? (see\nJohn 3:16\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nJesus Christ suffered and died for me.\nThe week of Easter is a good time to teach your children about what the Savior did for us in Gethsemane and on the cross. You could start by showing them the pictures below and letting them talk about what’s happening in the pictures. While your children are looking at the pictures, you could read verses that describe these events (see\nMatthew 26:36–46\n;\n27:35–50\n;\nLuke 22:39–46\n;\nJohn 19:16–30\n). Your children could point out details in the pictures that they hear in the verses.\nLeft:\nChrist in Gethsemane\n, by Harry Anderson. Right:\nThe Crucifixion\n, by Harry Anderson\nHow are we blessed because of Jesus’s sacrifice for us? Help your children look for words and phrases that answer this question in\nIsaiah 53:4–12\n;\nAlma 7:11–13\n; and\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:16–19\n. Share with each other how you feel about the Savior after reading these scriptures.\nJesus Christ was resurrected for me.\nYou could use this week’s activity page or other pictures in this outline to tell your children the story of the Resurrection (see also “\nJesus Is Risen\n,” in\nNew Testament Stories\n, 139–44). Then let your children tell the story back to you.\nConsider how you will help your children find joy in Christ this Easter. For example, you could sing together a favorite Easter hymn, such as “\nChrist the Lord Is Risen Today\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 200) or “Gethsemane” (Gospel Library). To find other songs about the Resurrection, you could look in the topical index of\nHymns\nand\nChildren’s Songbook\n. You and your children could share with each other why you like these songs and how you feel when you sing them. What do these songs teach us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\nChildren can feel the Spirit but may need help recognizing His influence.\n“Teach children about the different ways the Spirit communicates with us. Help them recognize His voice as He speaks to them. This will help them develop a habit of seeking and acting on personal revelation throughout their lives” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n32\n). For example, as you sing songs about the Savior with your children, look at pictures of Him, or read stories about Him, share with each other the spiritual feelings you have.\nGospel Library has a collection of\nEaster videos\nthat your children might enjoy. Maybe you could let them pick one to watch. Ask them what they learn about Jesus Christ from the video. You might also ask them to summarize the message of the video in one sentence.\nProphets testify of Jesus Christ and His Atonement.\nAs you and your children watch general conference together this Easter weekend, help them notice when the Savior’s special witnesses bear testimony of the Resurrection. Perhaps you could make a game of it—invite them to stand every time they hear words like\nEaster\nor\nAtonement\nor\nResurrection\n. Share with each other why you’re grateful for the living prophets’ testimonies of the Savior.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Plague after plague afflicted Egypt, but Pharaoh still refused to release the Israelites. And yet God continued to demonstrate His power and give Pharaoh opportunities to accept “that I am the Lord” and “there is none like me in all the earth” (\nExodus 7:5\n;\n9:14\n). Meanwhile, Moses and the Israelites must have watched with awe at these manifestations of God’s power on their behalf. Surely these continued signs confirmed their faith in God and strengthened their willingness to follow God’s prophet. Then, after nine terrible plagues had failed to free the Israelites, it was the tenth plague—the death of the firstborn, including Pharaoh’s firstborn—that finally ended the captivity. This seems fitting because in every case of spiritual captivity, there truly is only one way to escape. It is only the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Firstborn—the blood of the Lamb without blemish—that will save us.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nExodus 7–11\nI can choose to soften my heart.\nHopefully, your will is never opposed to God’s will as Pharaoh’s was. Still, we all have times when our hearts aren’t as soft as they should be.

Note the clarification in the Joseph Smith Translation of\nExodus 7:3, 13\n;\n9:12\n.\nWhy is “hard” a good description of Pharaoh’s heart? Consider what you learn from these verses about having a soft heart:\n1 Nephi 2:16\n;\nMosiah 3:19\n;\nAlma 24:7–8\n;\n62:41\n;\nEther 12:27\n. As you read about the consequences of Pharaoh’s hard-heartedness, ponder the condition of your heart. What changes do you feel inspired to make?\nExodus 12:1–42\nJesus Christ can save me because of His Atonement.\nThe only way for the Israelites to be spared from the tenth plague, described in\nExodus 11:4–5\n, was to follow precisely the instructions the Lord gave to Moses in\nExodus 12\n, a ritual known as the Passover. The Passover teaches us through symbols that just as the Lord delivered the Israelites from bondage in Egypt, He can also deliver us from the bondage of sin. To explore this symbolism in\nExodus 12:1–42\n, you could use a chart like this one:\nSymbol\nPossible meanings\nGod’s message to me\nSymbol\nThe beginning of months\n(\nverse 2\n; the Lord commanded the Israelites to use this event to mark the beginning of their calendar).\nPossible meanings\nThis was to be a new beginning for Israel. They were to be “born again.”\nSymbol\nThe lamb\n(\nverses 3–5\n).\nPossible meanings\nSee\nJohn 1:29\n;\n6:54\n;\n1 Peter 1:19\n.\nSymbol\nBlood of the lamb on the doorposts\n(\nverses 7, 13, 23\n).\nPossible meanings\nSee\nMosiah 4:2\n;\nRevelation 12:11\n.\nSymbol\nUnleavened bread\n(\nverses 8, 15, 19–20\n).\nPossible meanings\nLeaven, or yeast, can be a symbol of corruption because it spoils easily. See\nMatthew 16:6–12\n;\nJohn 6:35\n.\nSymbol\nBitter herbs\n(\nverse 8\n).\nPossible meanings\nA reminder of the bitterness of sin and captivity. See\nExodus 1:14\n;\nMoses 6:55\n.\nSymbol\nEating in haste, dressed to leave\n(\nverse 11\n).\nPossible meanings\nA symbol of urgency to leave the captivity of sin. See\nGenesis 39:12\n;\n2 Timothy 2:22\n.\nSymbol\nThe destroyer\n(\nverses 13, 23\n).\nPossible meanings\nSee\nDoctrine and Covenants 89:18–21\n.\nSymbol\nThe Israelites were set free\n(\nverses 29–32\n).\nPossible meanings\nSee\n2 Nephi 2:26\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:15–19, 31\n.\nWhat else do you find in the instructions and symbols of the Passover that reminds you of Jesus Christ and His Atonement? What do these symbols suggest to you about how to receive the blessings of His Atonement?\nCome unto Christ by identifying symbols that testify of Him.\n“All things,” the Lord declared, “are created and made to bear record of me” (\nMoses 6:63\n; see also\n2 Nephi 11:4\n). In\nExodus 12\n, symbols like a lamb, blood, unleavened bread, miracles, and deliverance all point to Christ. “Once we understand how these objects relate to the Savior, they can teach us of His power and attributes” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n7\n).\nIn Remembrance of Me\n, by Walter Rane\nExodus 12:14–17, 24–27\n;\n13:1–16\nThe sacrament helps me remember my deliverance through Jesus Christ.\nThe Savior commanded the Israelites to observe the Passover each year to help them remember He had delivered them, even after their captivity became a distant memory. As you read His instructions in\nExodus 12:14–17, 24–27\n;\n13:1–16\n, think about what you are doing to remember God’s blessings for you. How can you preserve that remembrance “throughout your generations”? (see\nExodus 12:14, 26–27\n).\nWhat similarities do you see between the feast of the Passover and the sacrament? What can you do to “always remember” Jesus Christ? (\nMoroni 4:3\n;\n5:2\n).\nYou might also ponder other things the Lord wants you to remember; see, for example,\nHelaman 5:6–12\n;\nMoroni 10:3\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 3:3–5, 10\n;\n18:10\n;\n52:40\n.\nSee also Kevin W. Pearson, “\nAre You Still Willing?\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 67–69; “Always Remember Him” (video), Gospel Library; “\nIn Memory of the Crucified\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 190.\n5:27\nAlways Remember Him\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nHow were Pharaoh’s magicians able to imitate some of the miracles performed by Moses and Aaron?\nHow did later generations continue to remember the Passover?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nExodus 7–11\nThe Lord has power over all things.\nThe plagues described in\nExodus 7–11\nshowed the Egyptians and the Israelites that the Lord has great power. The Lord will help your children throughout their lives when they have faith in His power. To help them learn from this story, you could give each child a paper divided into 10 sections, and invite them to draw pictures of the plagues described in these verses:\nExodus 7:17–18\n;\n8:1–4\n;\n8:16–17\n;\n8:20–22\n;\n9:1–6\n;\n9:8–9\n;\n9:22–23\n;\n10:4–5\n;\n10:21–22\n;\n11:4–7\n(see also “\nThe Plagues of Egypt\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 67–69). Read together\nExodus 7:5\nand\n9:14\nto explain why the Lord sent the plagues.\n2:3\nThe Plagues of Egypt\nShare with your children how the Lord has shown you “that there is none like [Him] in all the earth” (\nExodus 9:14\n). Let them share how they know that the Lord is powerful.\nExodus 8:28–32\n;\n9:7\nThe Lord can help me have a soft heart.\nTo help your children visualize what it means to have a soft heart, it might be fun to show them an object that is hard, such as a rock, and another that is soft and absorbent, such as a sponge. You could also pour water over these objects to demonstrate how easily a soft heart receives the word of the Lord. You could then read together a few verses describing how Pharaoh responded to the plagues sent by the Lord (see\nExodus 8:28–32\n;\n9:7\n). Which of the objects best represents Pharaoh’s heart or attitude? What does it mean to have a soft heart? (see\nMosiah 3:19\n). Elder Christopher H. Kim’s message “\nHarden Not Your Heart\n” could also help your children understand the difference between a hard heart and a soft one (\nLiahona\n, May 2025, 118–20, especially the fifth paragraph).\nYou and your children could make a list of some actions that might show when we have a hard heart (for example, using unkind words or being unwilling to share). How can we show the Lord we want to have soft hearts?\nExodus 12:1–13\nThe sacrament can help me remember Jesus.\nThe Passover taught the Israelites to look forward to the Savior and His sacrifice for us. As you explore\nExodus 12:1–13\ntogether, help your children see connections between the details of the Passover and Jesus Christ’s Atonement (see also “\nThe Passover\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 70–74). For example, how is Jesus like the lamb described in\nverse 5\n?\n2:54\nThe Passover\nToday, we take the sacrament to remember Jesus’s sacrifice. You could show your children a picture of the sacrament and talk about how this ordinance helps us remember Jesus Christ. You might help your children find the word “remember” in the sacrament prayers (see\nMoroni 4–5\n). Or sing together a favorite hymn about the sacrament, and help your children notice the peaceful feeling they have when they think about the Savior. How can we seek that feeling when we take the sacrament?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "The Israelites were trapped. The Red Sea was on one side, and the army of Pharaoh was advancing on the other. Their escape from Egypt, it seemed, would be short lived. But God had a message for the Israelites that He wanted them to remember for generations: “Fear ye not. … The Lord shall fight for you” (\nExodus 14:13–14\n).\nSince that time, when God’s people have needed faith and courage, they have told this story. When Nephi wanted to inspire his brothers, he said, “Let us be strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground” (\n1 Nephi 4:2\n). When King Limhi wanted his captive people to “lift up [their] heads, and rejoice,” he reminded them of this same story (\nMosiah 7:19\n). So did Alma, when he wanted to testify to his son of God’s power (see\nAlma 36:28\n). And when we feel trapped—when we need a little more faith to “see the salvation of the Lord”—we can remember how “the Lord saved Israel that day” (\nExodus 14:13, 30\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nExodus 14\n;\nExodus 15:1–21\nThe Lord can do a “great work” in my life.\nAs you read\nExodus 14:1–10\n, imagine how the Israelites might have felt as they saw Pharaoh’s army closing in. Perhaps you feel that you need a miracle to survive a difficult challenge you are facing. What do you find in\nExodus 14:13–31\nthat inspires you to seek God’s power in your life? Ponder how you have seen His power in the past. What have you learned about Him from these experiences?\nExodus 15:1–19\nis a song of praise that the Israelites sang after the Lord parted the Red Sea. Which phrases in this song do you find especially meaningful? Maybe there’s a hymn that you feel like singing when the Lord has done something amazing for you, such as “\nRedeemer of Israel\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 6). Consider singing or listening to it as part of your worship today.\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 8:2–3\n.\nExodus 15:22–27\n;\n16:1–15\n;\n17:1–7\nThe Lord can make bitter things sweet.\nReading about Israel’s journey might lead you to think about things in your life that have seemed “bitter” like the waters of Marah (see\nExodus 15:23–27\n). How has the Lord made bitter things in your life sweet? What value have these experiences had in your life?\nYou’ll notice more examples of bitter experiences for the Israelites in\nExodus 16\nand\n17\n. It’s tempting to be critical of their murmuring or complaining, but as you read, consider whether you have ever done the same thing. What do you learn from the Israelites’ experiences that can help you murmur less and trust God more? What do these verses teach you about God?\nSee also\n1 Nephi 2:11–12\n.\nThe Israelites gathering manna. Neo-gothic fresco, Trnava (detail)\nExodus 16\nThe Lord offers me daily spiritual nourishment.\nSince we all need to eat, the Lord often compares spiritual things to food. Look for His spiritual lessons in the Israelites’ experiences with manna in\nExodus 16\n. For example, what do you find in the Lord’s instructions in\nExodus 16:16, 19, 22–26\nthat applies to your spiritual nourishment?\nTo discover other lessons the Lord may want you to learn from this miracle, ponder questions like these:\nWhat does the Lord give me that is like the daily manna that He gave the Israelites?\nWhat can I do that is like gathering manna?\nYou may find additional insights in one or more of these videos: “Daily Bread: Pattern,” “Daily Bread: Experience,” and “Daily Bread: Change” (Gospel Library).\n2:52\nDaily Bread: Pattern\n3:12\nDaily Bread: Experience\n3:0\nDaily Bread: Change\nThink of other things, besides eating, that you do every day. Why do certain things have to be done daily to be effective? What do you feel inspired to do to seek daily spiritual experiences?\nSee also Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “\nDaily Restoration\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 77–79; “Daily Restoration” (video), Gospel Library.\n5:27\nDaily Restoration\nExodus 17:1–7\nJesus Christ is my spiritual rock and living water.\nThink about the Savior as you read\nExodus 17:1–7\n. How is Jesus Christ like a rock to you? (see\nPsalm 62:6–7\n;\nHelaman 5:12\n). How is He like water? (see\nJohn 4:10–14\n;\n1 Corinthians 10:1–4\n;\n1 Nephi 11:25\n).\nLook for physical objects that testify of Christ.\nWhenever the scriptures describe things that could be symbols of Jesus Christ, like\nExodus 17:1–7\ndoes, it might be an opportunity for an object lesson. Looking at or touching a rock or water can make it easier to understand how these objects are like Jesus Christ. If you can involve multiple senses in learning, it will be more memorable and impactful.\nExodus 17:8–16\n;\n18:13–26\nDisciples help each other “bear the burden” of doing the Lord’s work.\nThere may be times in your life when you can relate to Moses—when others are depending on you, but your “hands [feel] heavy” (\nExodus 17:12\n). Other times, you might be more like Aaron, Hur, and Jethro, who supported Moses. Put yourself in the position of each of these people as you read\nExodus 17:8–16\n;\n18:13–26\n, and see what the Lord teaches you about His work.\nSee also\nMosiah 4:27\n;\n18:8–9\n.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhat was the purpose of the pillar of cloud and fire?\nWhat was symbolic about Israel’s crossing of the Red Sea?\nWhy did the Lord command Moses to destroy the Amalekites?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nExodus 14:5–22\nThe Lord can do a “great work” in my life.\nWhen the Lord parted the Red Sea, Moses and the Israelites saw how powerful He is. Let your children help you think of a fun way to reenact the story from\nExodus 14:5–22\n(see also “\nThe Passover\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 70–74). Maybe you could set up chairs or blankets and “divide” them like the Red Sea. Then you could share with each other how you have seen God’s power in your lives.\n2:54\nThe Passover\nWhat does\nDoctrine and Covenants 8:2–3\nadd to our understanding of the story in\nExodus 14\n? Consider telling your children about an experience when the Holy Ghost told you something in your mind or heart, and invite them to talk about their experiences. You could also sing a song about the Holy Ghost, such as “\nLet the Holy Spirit Guide\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 143).\nExodus 15:22–25\nThe Lord can make bitter things sweet.\nMaybe you and your children could drink something sweet and something bitter while studying\nExodus 15:22–25\ntogether. How has the Savior made “bitter” experiences in our lives “sweet”?\nExodus 15:23–25\n;\n16:14–15\n;\n17:1–6\nJesus is my Living Water, my Bread of Life, and my Rock.\nAs you and your children read\nExodus 15:23–25\n;\n16:14–15\n;\n17:1–6\n, let them help you find objects to help tell each story—like a branch (to heal the water at Marah), a jar or pot (to fill with manna), and a rock (for the water at Horeb). What do these stories remind us about what Jesus Christ does for us? As part of your discussion, you might read\nMatthew 7:24–27\n;\nJohn 4:10–14\n;\n6:29–35, 48–51\n;\nHelaman 5:12\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n.\nOne Before God\n, by Joseph Brickey (detail)\nExodus 17:8–16\n;\n18:13–26\nI can help “bear the burden” of doing the Lord’s work.\nAs you read\nExodus 17:8–16\n, you could invite a child to hold their hands high in the air. When the child gets tired, other children could help, the way Aaron and Hur helped Moses. What does this story teach about how we can help God’s kingdom be successful? You could also read\nExodus 18:13–26\nand talk about the heavy responsibilities of people who serve in your ward. What can we do today to help our Church leaders, just as Aaron and Hur helped the prophet Moses?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Although the children of Israel had murmured and wavered in the past, when Moses read the law at the foot of Mount Sinai, they made this covenant: “All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient” (\nExodus 24:7\n). God then called Moses onto the mountain, telling him to build a tabernacle so “that I may dwell among them” (\nExodus 25:8\n).\nBut while Moses was at the top of the mountain learning how the Israelites could have God’s presence among them, the Israelites were at the bottom of the mountain making a golden idol to worship instead. Soon after promising to “have no other gods,” they “turned aside quickly” from their promise (\nExodus 20:3\n;\n32:8\n; see also\nExodus 24:3\n). It was a surprising turn, but we know from experience that faith and commitment can sometimes be overcome by impatience, fear, or doubt. As we seek the Lord’s presence in our lives, it is encouraging to know the Lord did not give up on ancient Israel and He will not give up on us and the people we love—for He is “merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth” (\nExodus 34:6\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nExodus 19:3–6\nThe Lord’s covenant people are a treasure to Him.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught: “In the Old Testament, the Hebrew term from which\npeculiar\nwas translated is\nsegullah\n, which means ‘valued property,’ or ‘treasure.’ … For us to be identified by servants of the Lord as his\npeculiar\npeople is a compliment of the highest order” (“\nChildren of the Covenant\n,”\nEnsign\n, May 1995, 34). How do President Nelson’s words affect the way you understand\nExodus 19:3–6\n? How has the Lord shown you that He treasures you?\nExodus 19:10–11, 17\nSacred experiences require preparation.\nThe Lord told Moses that the children of Israel needed to be prepared before they could “meet with God” (\nExodus 19:10–11, 17\n) and keep a covenant with Him (see\nExodus 19:5\n). How do you prepare for spiritual experiences, including the sacrament and temple ordinances? How can you help others prepare? What do you learn about preparation from\nLuke 6:12–13\n;\nEnos 1:2–6\n;\nAlma 17:2–3\n?\nThis mountain in Egypt is traditionally believed to be Mount Sinai.\nExodus 20:1–17\nObedience to God’s commandments brings blessings.\nWhile the Israelites were gathered at the base of Mount Sinai, they heard the voice of God give the Ten Commandments (see\nDeuteronomy 4:12–13\n). These, of course, aren’t God’s only commandments—there are many others in the scriptures. So as you read\nExodus 20:1–17\n, ask yourself why God emphasized these ten in particular. Here’s a sample table you could use as you ponder the importance of the Ten Commandments in your life:\nCommandment\nIn other words, the Lord is asking me to …\nBlessings that come from living this commandment\nHow does keeping these ten commandments help you keep the two great commandments Jesus gave in\nMatthew 22:34–40\n?\nWhat are things that you may be tempted to put before God? What blessings have you seen from putting God first?\nHow would you respond to someone who says the Ten Commandments were given a long time ago and do not apply today? What examples from your life would you share as part of your response? How might the hymn “\nHow Gentle God’s Commands\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 125) affect the way you explain God’s commandments to others?\nHow has the Lord fulfilled the promise in\nExodus 20:6\nin your life?\nSee also “\nThe Great Commandment—Love the Lord\n,” in\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson\n(2014), 37–45; Dallin H. Oaks, “\nNo Other Gods\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 72–75; Topics and Questions, “\nCommandments\n,” Gospel Library.\nExodus 24:1–11\nMaking covenants shows my willingness to obey God’s law.\nAs you read\nExodus 24:3–8\n, consider the covenants you have made with God. While Israel’s covenant included rituals that are different from what God requires today, you may notice some similarities. For example,\nverses 4, 5, and 8\nmention an altar, animal sacrifices, and blood. What could these things represent, and how do they relate to your covenants?\nExodus 32–34\nSin is turning away from God; repentance is turning toward Him and away from evil.\nTry to put yourself in the Israelites’ place—you’re in the wilderness, Moses has been gone for 40 days, and a confrontation with the Canaanites over the promised land is in your future (see\nExodus 32:1–8\n). Why do you think the Israelites wanted a golden idol? What inspires you about Moses’s plea to the Lord in\nExodus 33:11–17\n?\nWhile the Israelites’ sin was serious, this story also includes a message of God’s mercy and forgiveness. What does\nExodus 34:1–10\nteach you about the Savior? (see\nExodus 32:30–32\n;\nMosiah 14:4–8\n;\n15:9\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:3–5\n).\nExodus 31:13–16\nThe Sabbath is a sign.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson explained: “In my much younger years, I studied the work of others who had compiled lists of things to do and things\nnot\nto do on the Sabbath. It wasn’t until later that I learned from the scriptures that my conduct and my attitude on the Sabbath constituted a\nsign\nbetween me and my Heavenly Father [see\nExodus 31:13\n;\nEzekiel 20:12, 20\n]. With that understanding, I no longer needed lists of dos and don’ts. When I had to make a decision whether or not an activity was appropriate for the Sabbath, I simply asked myself, ‘What\nsign\ndo I want to give to God?’ That question made my choices about the Sabbath day crystal clear” (“\nThe Sabbath Is a Delight\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 130). Ponder what sign you want to give God with your observance of the Sabbath.\nExodus 34:1–4\nWhat was the difference between the two sets of stone tables Moses made?\nWhen Moses came down from the mountain, he brought the law written on stone tables. After finding that the Israelites had broken their covenant, Moses broke the tables (see\nExodus 31:18\n;\n32:19\n). Later, God commanded Moses to make another set of stone tables and take them back to the mountain (see\nExodus 34:1–4\n). The\nJoseph Smith Translation of Exodus 34:1–2\n(in the Bible appendix) clarifies that the first set of stone tables included the ordinances of God’s “holy order,” or the Melchizedek Priesthood. The second set included “the law of a carnal commandment.” This was a lesser law administered by the “lesser priesthood” (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:17–27\n), which was meant to prepare the Israelites for the higher law and higher priesthood so they could enter into God’s presence.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhat was significant about the Israelites’ unwillingness to have God speak directly to them?\nWhy did the Israelites create a golden calf to worship?\nWho can see God’s face and live?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nExodus 20:3–17\nGod gives me commandments because He wants me to be happy.\nHow can you make learning about the Ten Commandments fun for your children? As you read\nExodus 20:3–17\ntogether, let your children help you find or draw a picture to represent each of the Ten Commandments. Then your children could take turns choosing a picture and talking about how they can live that commandment. Share with each other how living that commandment brings you happiness.\nYou could also sing a song like “\nKeep the Commandments\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 146–47). Help your children find words in the song that teach them why God wants us to keep His commandments.\nWhen children share spiritual experiences, their testimony grows.\nThe questions you ask can encourage your children to share how they feel about the Savior and how living the gospel has blessed them (see\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n32\n). When they do this, they are bearing testimony. Consider how you can do this as you discuss the blessings that come from living the Ten Commandments.\nExodus 20:12\nThe Lord wants me to honor my parents.\nHelp your children learn the phrase “Honour thy father and thy mother” (\nExodus 20:12\n). You may want to explain that to “honor” someone can mean to show respect for them or to bring them happiness. What did Jesus do to honor His mortal mother and His Heavenly Father? (see\nLuke 2:48–51\n;\nJohn 19:26–27\n). Perhaps your children could take turns acting out things they can do to honor their parents, while the other children guess what they are doing.\nExodus 31:13, 16–17\nHonoring the Sabbath is a sign of my love for the Lord.\nYour children might enjoy looking at examples of signs—such as road signs or signs on a building. What are the purposes of signs? Your children could then find the word “sign” in\nExodus 31:13, 16–17\n. What did the Lord say is a sign between us and Him? Share with each other some of the ways you and your family try to show your love for the Lord on the Sabbath.\nIllustration of Moses holding the Ten Commandments, by Sam Lawlor (detail)\nExodus 32:1–8, 19–24\n;\n34:6–7\nI will not “turn aside” from God’s ways.\nConsider using “\nMoses on Mount Sinai\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 77–82) to help your children learn the story in\nExodus 32:1–8, 19–24\n. Why was it wrong for the Israelites to worship a statue instead of God?\n2:55\nMoses on Mount Sinai\nIt might be fun to create a path on the floor (or find one near your home) to illustrate these words from\nExodus 32:8\n: “They have turned aside quickly out of the way.” While walking on the path, your children could talk about temptations we face to turn away from God. What helps us remain on God’s path—and return to it if we have strayed? (see\nExodus 34:6–7\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Leaving Egypt—as important as that was—didn’t fully accomplish God’s purposes for the children of Israel. Even a comfortable life in the promised land wasn’t God’s ultimate goal for them. These were only steps toward what God really wanted for His people: “Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy” (\nLeviticus 19:2\n). How did God plan to make His people holy after they had lived in captivity for generations? He commanded them to create a place of holiness in the wilderness—a tabernacle. He gave them covenants and laws to guide their actions and change their hearts. And He commanded them to make animal sacrifices to teach them about atonement for their sins. All of this was meant to point their minds, hearts, and lives toward the Savior. He is the true path to holiness, for the Israelites and for us. We have all spent some time in the captivity of sin, and we are all invited to leave sin behind and follow Jesus Christ, who has promised, “I am able to make you holy” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 60:7\n).\nFor an overview of the book of Leviticus, see “\nLeviticus\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nExodus 35–40\n;\nLeviticus 19\nThe Lord wants me to become holy.\nExodus 35–40\ndescribes the Israelites’ efforts to build a tabernacle, where sacred ordinances would help them become a holy people. As you read these chapters, look for the things the Lord asked His people to place in the tabernacle. What might these items represent? What do they suggest to you about increasing in holiness? Especially consider how these items turn your thoughts toward the Savior. A table like this might help you:\nWhat object did you find?\nWhat can this represent?\nWhat object did you find?\nArk of the covenant (\nExodus 37:1–9\n;\n40:20–21\n)\nWhat can this represent?\n(See\nExodus 25:20–22\n; Guide to the Scriptures, “\nArk of the Covenant\n”)\nWhat object did you find?\nAltar of incense (\nExodus 40:26–27\n; see also\nExodus 30:1, 6–8\n)\nWhat can this represent?\n(See\nRevelation 8:3–4\n)\nWhat object did you find?\nCandlestick or lampstand (\nExodus 37:17–24\n)\nWhat can this represent?\n(See\nMatthew 5:14–16\n;\nJohn 8:12\n)\nWhat object did you find?\nAltar of sacrifice (\nExodus 38:1–7\n; see also\nExodus 27:1\n;\n29:10–14\n)\nWhat can this represent?\n(See Guide to the Scriptures, “\nSacrifice\n”)\nWhat object did you find?\nLaver (basin) of water (\nExodus 30:17–21\n)\nWhat can this represent?\n(See\n2 Chronicles 4:6\n;\nIsaiah 1:16\n;\nJeremiah 33:8\n)\nOf course, simply being in holy places doesn’t make us holy.\nLeviticus 19\ndescribes laws and commandments the Lord gave to help the Israelites increase in holiness. What do you find in these commandments that could help you seek holiness from the Lord? What do you feel impressed to do to more fully live these principles?\nSee also Henry B. Eyring, “\nHoliness and the Plan of Happiness\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 100–103; “The Tabernacle” (video), Gospel Library.\n7:19\nThe Tabernacle\nUse sacred music.\nMusic has great power to invite the influence of the Spirit and build faith in Jesus Christ. The messages in hymns often reinforce the doctrine in the scriptures. For instance, singing a hymn like “\nMore Holiness Give Me\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 131) can reinforce some of the messages taught in\nLeviticus 19\n. It can also help you think about what it means to become more holy like the Savior and ponder how He is helping you increase in holiness.\nExodus 35:4–35\n;\n36:1–7\nThe Lord asks me to make my offerings with a willing heart.\nIn the year after leaving Egypt, the relationship of the children of Israel with Jehovah could be described as inconsistent. And yet, as you read\nExodus 35:4–35\nand\n36:1–7\n, notice how the Israelites responded to the commandment to build the tabernacle. What do you learn from the Israelites that could help you better serve the Lord?\nHe may not ask you for precious metals, linens, or wood for a tabernacle. What has the Lord given you, and what is He asking you to offer? When has your “heart stirred [you] up to come unto the work”?\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nSacrifice\n,” Gospel Library.\nThe children of Israel gave offerings for the tabernacle with “a willing heart” (\nExodus 35:5\n). Illustration by Corbert Gauthier, © Lifeway Collection/licensed from\ngoodsalt.com\nExodus 40:12–14\nTemple ordinances were given anciently.\nExodus 40:12–14\nrefers to ancient ordinances that are also administered in our day in the house of the Lord. Here are some additional verses that can help you learn about how these ordinances testify of Jesus Christ:\nWashing:\nPsalm 51:2\n;\nEzekiel 36:25–27\nClothing in holy garments:\nIsaiah 61:10\n;\nMatthew 22:11–14\n;\nRevelation 19:7–8\nAnointing:\nLuke 4:18–19\n;\nActs 10:38\nLeviticus 1:1–9\n;\n4\n;\n16\nBecause of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, I can be forgiven.\nMuch of the book of Leviticus may seem strange to us—animal sacrifices, rituals involving blood and water, and laws governing small details of life. But these rituals and laws were meant to teach principles that are familiar—repentance, holiness, and the Savior’s Atonement. To find these principles as you read\nLeviticus 1:1–9\n;\n4\n;\n16\n, consider questions like these:\nWhat words or phrases do I find that remind me of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice?\nWhat do I learn from these sacrifices about the Savior’s sacrifice?\nHow am I like the people who made these sacrifices?\nThe Lord doesn’t require animal sacrifices anymore. But sacrifice is still an important principle of the gospel. To learn about the kinds of sacrifice the Lord does require, study\n3 Nephi 9:19–20\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:34\n. How are you offering these kinds of sacrifices? What does\nMoses 5:7\nteach you about how you should view your sacrifices?\nSee also “\nThoughts to Keep in Mind: The Tabernacle and Sacrifice\n.”\nStudy Helps\nWhy did the Lord command Moses to wash, anoint, and clothe Aaron and his sons?\nWhat as the Day of Atonement?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nExodus 35:20–29\n;\n36:1\nGod has given me gifts to help with His work.\nAt the end of this outline is a picture of the Israelites’ wilderness tabernacle. You might want to look at it with your children and ask them what materials would have been needed to build the tabernacle. Then you could read together\nExodus 35:20–29\nto find out how these materials were provided. How has the Lord invited us to contribute to building His kingdom?\nConsider reading with them\nExodus 36:1\nto find out what the Lord gave Bezaleel and Aholiab to help build the tabernacle. You could then talk with your children about what you feel the Lord has given them to help build His kingdom. How can we use these things to bless others?\nRome Italy Temple\nExodus 40:17–34\nI can feel the Lord’s presence in holy places.\nExodus 40:17–34\nlists things that were part of the Israelites’ tabernacle. Maybe you and your children could find them in these verses and in the picture of the tabernacle at the end of this outline. Talk about how each part of the tabernacle could teach about the Savior or Heavenly Father. For example, the ark of testimony could remind us of God’s commandments, the altar could remind us of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice, and so on.\nWhat holy places do we have today that help us feel closer to Jesus Christ? As part of this conversation, you could watch together the video “Temples” (Gospel Library). You could also sing a song like “Holy Places” (Gospel Library). Share with each other how you feel about sacred places like the temple.\n5:41\nWhat Is a Temple?\nLeviticus 1:1–4\nBecause of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, I can be forgiven.\nThe animal sacrifices described in the Old Testament were meant to teach the children of Israel about forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Consider how reading about these sacrifices could do the same for your children. You could show pictures of Jesus Christ in Gethsemane and on the cross (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 56\n,\n57\n) as you read with the children\nLeviticus 1:1–4\n. Help them find words or phrases that remind them of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.\nYou might also read together\n3 Nephi 9:19–20\nto find out what we are commanded to sacrifice instead of animals. What does it mean to offer a broken heart and contrite spirit to the Lord?

        "content": "Even on foot, it wouldn’t take 40 years to travel from the wilderness of Sinai to the promised land in Canaan. But that’s how long the children of Israel needed—not to cover the geographical distance but to cover the spiritual distance: the distance between who they were and who they could become as God’s covenant people.\nThe book of Numbers describes some of what happened during those 40 years, including lessons the children of Israel needed to learn before entering the promised land. They learned about being faithful to the Lord’s servants (see\nNumbers 12\n). They learned about trusting the Lord’s power, even when the future seems hopeless (see\nNumbers 13–14\n). And they learned that being faithless brings spiritual harm, but they could repent and look to the Savior for healing (see\nNumbers 21:4–9\n).\nWe’re all like the Israelites in some ways. We know what it’s like to be in a spiritual wilderness, and the lessons they learned can help us prepare to enter our promised land: eternal life with our Heavenly Father.\nFor an overview of the book of Numbers, see “\nNumbers\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nNumbers 11:11–17, 24–29\n;\n12\nRevelation is available to everyone, but God guides His Church through His prophet.\nIn\nNumbers 11:11–17, 24–29\n, notice the problem Moses faced and the solution God proposed. What do you think Moses meant when he said he wished “that all the Lord’s people were prophets”? (\nverse 29\n). As you ponder this question, look for possible answers in President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nRevelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 93–96).\nSaying we can all receive revelation, however, doesn’t mean we all can lead God’s people the way Moses did. The event in\nNumbers 12\nmakes this clear. What cautions do you find in this chapter? What do you feel the Lord wants you to understand about personal revelation and following His prophet?\nSee also\n1 Nephi 10:17\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 28:1–7\n; Dallin H. Oaks, “\nTwo Lines of Communication\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2010, 83–86.\nFocus on what’s most important.\nSome people get overwhelmed with the weekly reading suggestions in\nCome, Follow Me\n.

Understanding and fully applying\none\nprinciple in a week could be more helpful than reading several chapters only superficially.\nNumbers 12:3\n“Moses was very meek.”\nSome people are surprised to learn that Moses, the mighty leader who stood before Pharaoh and performed stunning miracles with the Lord’s power, was also “very meek” (\nNumbers 12:3\n). What does it mean to be meek? Consider studying Elder David A. Bednar’s explanation in “\nMeek and Lowly of Heart\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 30–33) or “\nMeek, Meekness\n” in Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library).\nWhat do you learn from Moses’s examples of meekness in\nExodus 18:13–25\n;\nNumbers 11:26–29\n;\nNumbers 12\n;\nHebrews 11:24–27\n; and\nMoses 1:10–11\n? You might also ponder how the Savior showed meekness (see\nMatthew 11:29\n;\n27:11–14\n;\nLuke 22:41–42\n;\nJohn 13:4–5\n). What do these examples teach you?\nNumbers 13–14\nWith faith in the Lord, I can have hope for the future.\nAs you read\nNumbers 13–14\n, try to put yourself in the place of the Israelites. Why do you think they wanted to “return into Egypt”? (\nNumbers 14:3\n). How would you describe the other “spirit” Caleb had? (\nNumbers 14:24\n). What impresses you about the faith of Caleb and Joshua, and how might you apply their examples to situations you face?\nTen of the Israelite spies were afraid; Joshua and Caleb had faith.\nJoshua and Caleb: Obedient Spies\n, by Douglas Klauba. © Lifeway Collection/licensed from\ngoodsalt.com\nNumbers 21:4–9\nIf I look to Jesus Christ in faith, He can heal me spiritually.\nBook of Mormon prophets knew the story found in\nNumbers 21:4–9\nand understood its spiritual significance. Read their teachings about this story in\n1 Nephi 17:40–41\n;\nAlma 33:18–22\n; and\nHelaman 8:13–15\n. Here are some questions to ponder as you do:\nWhat could the brass serpent represent?\nWhat might the snakebites represent?\nThe Israelites had to “[behold] the serpent of brass” (\nNumbers 21:9\n) to be healed. Why do you think some people refused to look? Does something similar ever happen to you?\nWhat do you feel inspired to do to more fully “look upon the Son of God with faith” and be healed? (\nHelaman 8:15\n). You may find some ideas in President D. Todd Christofferson’s message “\nLook to God and Live\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2025, 86–90)\nReading these passages might remind you of other times in the scriptures when people needed to keep their focus on Christ. For example, compare the message of\nNumbers 21:4–9\nwith\nMatthew 14:25–31\nand\n1 Nephi 8:24–28\n(see also the pictures at the end of this week’s outline). What tends to draw us away from Christ?

Balak wanted him to curse the Israelites. Notice how Balak tried to persuade Balaam (see\nNumbers 22:5–7, 15–17\n), and think about temptations you might face to go against God’s will. What impresses you about Balaam’s responses in\nNumbers 22:18, 38\n;\n23:8, 12, 26\n;\n24:13\n? Sadly, Balaam eventually gave in to pressure and betrayed Israel (see\nNumbers 31:16\n;\nJude 1:11\n).

Then you could summarize for them\nNumbers 11:4–10\n, emphasizing that the Israelites had forgotten their blessings and were complaining. What blessings do we sometimes forget?\nAs you sing or listen to a song about gratitude, such as “\nCount Your Blessings\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 241), your children could draw pictures of blessings the Lord has given them.\nNumbers 12\nThe Lord wants me to follow His prophet.\nTo introduce\nNumbers 12\n, you could tell your children that the Lord was unhappy with Aaron and Miriam, Moses’s brother and sister. Invite them to read\nNumbers 12:1–8\nto find out why. Consider using the\nGospel Art Book\nto help your children find examples of people in the scriptures who respected the Lord’s prophet and were blessed. How are we blessed when we follow the Lord’s prophet?\nNumbers 21:6–9\nI can look to Jesus Christ.\nYou could use “\nMoses and the Brass Serpent\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 83–84, to help your children learn what happened in\nNumbers 21:6–9\n. How is the brass serpent like Jesus Christ? (see\nJohn 3:14–15\n). Your children might enjoy making a serpent out of paper and writing on it some simple things they can do to “look upon the Son of God with faith” (\nHelaman 8:15\n).\n1:2\nMoses and the Brass Serpent\nOlder children could choose one of the following scriptures and share what it adds to their understanding of the story:\n1 Nephi 17:41\n;\nAlma 33:18–20\n;\nHelaman 8:13–15\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:36\n.\nBronze Serpent\n, by Brent Evans\nNumbers 22–24\nI can follow God’s will, even if others try to persuade me not to.\nSummarize\nNumbers 22:1–18\nfor your children, emphasizing how Balaam refused to curse God’s people, even though Balak, the king of Moab, offered him honor and riches. Then you could help your children search the following verses for phrases that they feel show that Balaam wanted to follow God:\nNumbers 22:18\n;\n23:26\n;\n24:13\n. Perhaps your children could pick one phrase they like and write it on a card to help them remember to obey the Lord.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Moses’s earthly ministry began on a mountain, when God spoke to him from a burning bush (see\nExodus 3:1–10\n). It also ended on a mountain, more than 40 years later, when God gave him a glimpse of the promised land from the top of Mount Nebo (see\nDeuteronomy 34:1–4\n). Moses had spent his life preparing the children of Israel to enter that promised land, and the book of Deuteronomy records his final instructions, reminders, exhortations, and pleadings with the Israelites. Reading his words makes it clear that the real object of Moses’s ministry—the preparation the people needed—wasn’t about wilderness survival, conquering enemies, or building a nation. It was about learning to love God, obey Him, and remain loyal to Him. That’s the preparation we all need to enter the promised land of eternal life. So although Moses never set foot in the “land flowing with milk and honey” (\nExodus 3:8\n), because of his faith and faithfulness, he did enter the promised land that God has prepared for all those who follow Him.\nFor an overview of Deuteronomy, see “\nDeuteronomy\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDeuteronomy 6:4–7\n;\n8:2–5, 11–17\n;\n29:18–20\n;\n30:6–10, 14–20\n“Love the Lord thy God with all thine heart.”\nThe law of Moses included many outward ceremonies and rituals. As you’ll see in Moses’s counsel in Deuteronomy, the Lord was also concerned about His people’s inward state—the spiritual condition of their hearts.\nIn the passages below, look for the word\nheart\n, and ponder what it might symbolize. You might think of these passages as a kind of spiritual checkup on your heart. What diagnosis would you give yourself? What treatments would you prescribe to improve the spiritual health of your heart?

For ideas, see “\nLove God, love your neighbor\n” in\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n, 10–12.\nSee also M. Russell Ballard, “\nLovest Thou Me More Than These?\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 51–53.\nSeek your own spiritual insights.\nCome, Follow Me\nsuggests passages and principles to focus on in the scriptures, but don’t let that limit your study. As you read Deuteronomy, you might discover a principle that is not highlighted here. Let the Spirit guide you to what you need to learn.\nDeuteronomy 6:4–12, 20–25\n“Beware lest thou forget the Lord.”\nMost of the Israelites who would enter the promised land had not seen the plagues in Egypt or crossed the Red Sea. Moses knew that they—and future generations—would need to remember God’s miracles and God’s laws to remain God’s people.\nWhat counsel do you find in\nDeuteronomy 6:4–12, 20–25\nthat could help you remember the great things God has done for you? What are you inspired to do so that the word of the Lord will daily “be in thine heart”? (\nverse 6\n).\nYou might also study Brother Jan E. Newman’s message “\nPreserving the Voice of the Covenant People in the Rising Generation\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 36–38) and consider how you will pass your faith in Christ to future generations.\nSee also\nDeuteronomy 11:18–21\n; Dale G.

Notice what\nverses 1–15\nteach about why we help people in need and what our attitude should be about it.\nWhat does it mean to “open thine hand wide” to people in need? (\nverses 8, 11\n). What do you learn from the Lord’s example about helping people in need? (see\nverse 15\n).\nSee also “\nHave I Done Any Good?\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 223.\nDeuteronomy 18:15–19\nMoses was “like unto” Jesus Christ.\nPeter, Nephi, Moroni, and the Savior Himself all commented on the prophecy in\nDeuteronomy 18:15–19\n(see\nActs 3:20–23\n;\n1 Nephi 22:20–21\n;\nJoseph Smith—History 1:40\n;\n3 Nephi 20:23\n). What do you learn about the Savior from these verses? Think about what you’ve read about Moses over the past few weeks. How is Moses “like unto” Jesus Christ?\nJesus Christ told His people in ancient America, “I am he of whom the prophet Moses spake” (\n3 Nephi 20:23\n).\nDeuteronomy 29:9\n;\n30:15–20\nThe Lord invites me to choose between good and evil.\nIt might be interesting to compare Moses’s words in\nDeuteronomy 29:9\n;\n30:15–20\nwith some of Lehi’s final teachings to his family in\n2 Nephi 2:26–29\n;\n4:4\n. How did Lehi expand on what Moses taught? What do you find in these passages that inspires you to “choose life”?

Your children could point to the pictures as you read the words “heart,” “soul,” and “might” in the verse. How do we show the Lord that we love Him with all our heart, soul, and might?\nDeuteronomy 6:6–15\nI can keep the word of God in my heart.\nRead with your children the Lord’s counsel to the Israelites to put scripture passages where they would see them every day (see\nDeuteronomy 6:6–9\n). This might inspire you and your children to think of ways to make sure you don’t “forget the Lord” (\nverse 12\n) and to remember what He has done for you.\nYou might point out that\nDeuteronomy 6:13, 16\nand\n8:3\nhelped the Savior during an important moment in His life. To see how, read together\nMatthew 4:1–10\n. Then you could share with each other some scripture passages that have helped you in times of need.\nDeuteronomy 18:15–18\nProphets teach us about Jesus Christ.\nAs you read\nDeuteronomy 18:18\ntogether, help your children understand that the Prophet like Moses in this verse is Jesus Christ. Maybe you could look at pictures of things Moses did and things Jesus Christ did, and let your children match them (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 15\n,\n16\n,\n38\n,\n39\n). What has our prophet today taught us about the Savior?\nDeuteronomy 29:12–13\n;\n30:8–10\nBecause of my covenants, I am part of God’s people.\nTalking about\nDeuteronomy 29:12–13\nprovides an opportunity for you and your children to talk about covenants they will make or have made with Heavenly Father. What does it mean to be God’s people? How do our promises make us God’s people? (see\nverse 13\n; see also\nMosiah 18:8–10\n).\nIf your children need help understanding what a covenant is, suggest that they find a definition in “\nCovenant\n” in the Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library). What promises did God and the Israelites make with each other in\nDeuteronomy 30:8–10\n? What promises have we made with God? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37, 77\n). How do these promises connect us with Him? Consider singing together a song about covenants, such as “Standing on the Promises” (Gospel Library).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "It had taken several generations, but the Lord’s promise was about to be fulfilled: the children of Israel were finally going to inherit the promised land. But in their way stood the Jordan River, the walls of Jericho, and a mighty people who had rejected the Lord (see\n1 Nephi 17:35\n). And they would have to face all of that without their beloved leader Moses. The situation may have made some Israelites feel weak and fearful, but the Lord said, “Be strong and of a good courage.” What reason did they have to be courageous? It wasn’t because of their own strength—or even Moses’s or Joshua’s—but because “the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest” (\nJoshua 1:9\n). When we have our own rivers to cross and walls to bring down, wonderful things can happen in our lives because “the Lord will do wonders among [us]” (\nJoshua 3:5\n).\nFor an overview of the book of Joshua, see “\nJoshua, book of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJoshua 1:1–9\nGod will be with me as I strive to be faithful to Him.\nImagine what it might have been like for Joshua to be called to replace Moses. Notice what the Lord said in\nJoshua 1:1–9\nto encourage him. Think about the difficult challenges you face; what in these verses gives you courage?\nThe name Joshua (\nYehoshua\nor\nYeshua\nin Hebrew) means “Jehovah saves.” And the name\nJesus\ncomes from\nYeshua\n. So as you read about Joshua, consider his role in leading the children of Israel across the Jordan River and into the promised land. How was his mission similar to what Christ does for us?\nJoshua 1:8\nThe word of God can make my way prosperous.\nAs He encouraged Joshua, the Lord gave counsel in\nJoshua 1:8\nabout the scriptures, or “the word of the law.” Considering Joshua’s heavy responsibility, why might this counsel have been especially helpful?\nWhen the Lord invites us to read the scriptures, He often uses words that go beyond just reading. He also promises great blessings. The table below can help you discover these invitations and promised blessings:\nInvitation\nPromised blessings\nJoshua 1:8\nInvitation\nMeditate day and night\nPromised blessings\n1 Nephi 15:23–24\nInvitation\nPromised blessings\n2 Nephi 32:3\nInvitation\nPromised blessings\nMosiah 1:7\nInvitation\nPromised blessings\nProsper in the land\nHelaman 3:29–30\nInvitation\nPromised blessings\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:85\nInvitation\nPromised blessings\nRussell M.

Now may be a good time to evaluate your scripture study habits. What’s going well? What do you feel inspired to do to have more meaningful experiences with the word of God?\nSee also “\nAs I Search the Holy Scriptures\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 277.\nJoshua 2\nBoth faith and works are necessary for salvation.\nNew Testament Christians saw Rahab as an example of the power of both faith and works (see\nHebrews 11:31\n;\nJames 2:25\n). As you read\nJoshua 2\n, consider the role of Rahab’s faith and works in saving herself, her family, and the Israelite spies. What does this teach you about how your faith in Christ and your works can influence yourself and others?\nRahab at her window.\nWaiting for the Promise\n, by Elspeth Young (detail)\nJoshua 3–4\nWith faith in Jesus Christ, I can experience God’s “wonders.”\nThe Lord worked wonders among His people as He led them into the promised land, and He can do the same for you. Here are some questions to guide your study of\nJoshua 3–4\n:\nWhy do you think the Israelites needed to sanctify themselves before they crossed the Jordan River? (see\nJoshua 3:5\n).\nNote that the river parted only after “the feet of the priests … were dipped in the brim of the water” (\nJoshua 3:13, 15\n). Why is that significant?\nSeveral other significant events happened at the Jordan River—see\n2 Kings 2:6–15\n;\n5:1–14\n; and\nMark 1:9–11\n. What connections do you see between these events?\nHow has the Lord done “wonders” in your life? (\nJoshua 3:5\n). How can you experience—or recognize—those wonders more often? (for example, see\nJoshua 3:17\n).\nJoshua 6–8\nObedience invites God’s power into my life.\nJoshua 6–8\ndeals with battles over the lands of Jericho and Ai. As you read these chapters, consider how you battle temptation (for example, see\nJoshua 7:10–13\n). What do you learn about how God can help you and what you need to do to access His power? For example, what impresses you about the Lord’s instructions for taking Jericho? (see\nJoshua 6:1–5\n). Perhaps the account in\nJoshua 7\nwill inspire you to determine if “there is an accursed thing” in your life that you need to remove (\nJoshua 7:13\n).\nJoshua 23–24\n“Choose you this day whom ye will serve.”\nJoshua’s final teachings to the Israelites in\nJoshua 23–24\ninclude important warnings, counsel, and promised blessings. Perhaps you could make a list of what you find. Considering everything the Israelites had been through, why do you think Joshua chose to tell them these things at the end of his life? What do you find that inspires you to “cleave unto the Lord”? (\nJoshua 23:8\n).\nSee also Dale G. Renlund, “\nChoose You This Day\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 104–6.\nStudy Helps\nWhat was the significance of the parting of the Jordan River?\nWhy was Achan’s sin so serious?\nWhat occurred on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nJoshua 1–4\n;\n6\n“Be strong and of a good courage.”\nHere is one way to help your children “be strong and of a good courage” (\nJoshua 1:6\n) through Jesus Christ. Invite them to find a phrase that is repeated in\nJoshua 1:6, 9\n, and\n18\n, and write it down or memorize it. Help your children think of situations where they might need this message, just as Joshua did. You could also review together some of the stories in\nJoshua 1–4\n;\n6\n(see also “\nJoshua the Prophet\n” and “\nRahab and the Spies\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 85–91). How did the people in these stories show courage and strength in the Lord?\n2:59\nJoshua the Prophet\n1:39\nRahab and the Spies\nJoshua 1:8\nStudying the scriptures brings me blessings.\nReading\nJoshua 1:8\ncould inspire your children to read the scriptures on their own. Help them find words in this verse that teach them\nhow\nand\nwhy\nwe should read the scriptures. They could look for the same thing in\n1 Nephi 15:23–24\n;\n2 Nephi 31:20\n;\n32:3\n;\nJacob 4:6\n;\nHelaman 3:29–30\n. You could also help them make and carry out a plan to read the scriptures.\nJoshua 3–4\nI must be baptized to enter the kingdom of heaven.\nYou might use the story of the Israelites crossing the Jordan River as a symbol of baptism—giving up our old life in the wilderness and starting a new one in a covenant relationship with God. So as you read together\nJoshua 3–4\n(or “\nJoshua the Prophet\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 85–89), you could also look at a picture of Jesus being baptized and explain that Jesus was baptized in the same river the Israelites crossed. You could then sing a song such as “\nBaptism\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 100–101). Share with each other how being baptized is like starting a new life in Jesus Christ’s kingdom.\n2:59\nJoshua the Prophet\nJoshua 24:15\nI can choose to serve Jesus Christ.\nWhat could you do to help your children learn to choose to follow Jesus Christ, as Joshua invited the Israelites to do? You might invite them to:\nMemorize a short phrase\nfrom\nJoshua 24:15\n. Try to make it fun for your children. The number of words they memorize may depend on their age.\nFind stories\nabout people who chose to serve Jesus Christ. They could look in the\nFriend\nmagazine, the\nGospel Art Book\n, or\nOld Testament Stories\nand other scripture stories books.\nRole-play situations\nin which they can choose to follow and serve the Savior.\nUse a variety of activities.\n“All children are different, and as they develop, their needs will change. Varying your teaching methods will help you meet their diverse needs” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n31\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "We all know what it’s like to sin, feel bad about it, and then repent and resolve to change our ways. But too often we forget our earlier resolve, and, when temptation comes, we find ourselves committing the same sin. This pattern appears frequently in the book of Judges. Influenced by the beliefs and worship practices of the Canaanites—whom they were supposed to drive out of the land—the Israelites broke their covenants with the Lord and turned away from worshipping Him. As a result, they lost His protection and fell into captivity. And yet each time this happened, the Lord gave His covenant people the chance to repent and raised up a deliverer, a military leader called a “judge.” Not all of the judges in the book of Judges were righteous, but some of them exercised great faith in delivering the children of Israel and restoring them to their covenant relationship with the Lord. These stories remind us that no matter what has led us away from Jesus Christ, He is the Redeemer of Israel and is always willing to deliver us and welcome us back as we return to Him.\nFor an overview of the book of Judges, see “\nJudges, book of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJudges 2:1–19\n;\n3:5–12\nThe Lord forgives as often as I repent.\nThe book of Judges can be both a warning and an encouragement. Look for this warning and encouragement as you read\nJudges 2:1–19\n;\n3:5–12\n. How do you feel the warning and encouragement apply to you?\nFor example, if\nJudges 2:19\nwere about you and your temptations rather than about the ancient Israelites, what might it say? If\nJudges 3:9\nwere about what the Lord had done to deliver you, what might it say?\nConsider reading the question and answer on\npage 9\nof\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n. How do you feel this applies to the Israelites’ experience in the book of Judges? What does this teach you about Jesus Christ?\nJudges 4:1–15\nI can inspire others to have faith in the Lord.\nSometimes the faith of one person can inspire faith in many others. In\nJudges 4\n, that one person was Deborah. Read about her in\nJudges 4:1–15\n, and note the influence she had on people around her. Here are some questions to help you consider how her experience might apply to your life:\nHow would you describe the conditions the Israelites were in at the time? (see\nverses 1–3\n). What similarities do you see to conditions today—in individuals and society?\nWhat words or actions of Deborah show you that she had faith in the Lord? How did her faith influence others? What else impresses you about her?\nWhat do you think Deborah meant by her question in\nverse 14\n: “Is not the Lord gone out before thee?” How does the Lord “go out before” you? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:87–88\n).\nPonder how your faith in Jesus Christ could bless others the way Deborah’s faith blessed Barak and the other Israelites. To help you think about this, you might study Elder Neil L. Andersen’s message “\nWe Talk of Christ\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 88–91). Search the message for (1) reasons to speak more openly about the Savior and (2) ways to do it.\nThen you might make a list of things you know about Jesus Christ—from the scriptures, from words of living prophets, and from your personal experience. Who needs to know this? How will you share it?\nSee also\nMatthew 5:14–16\n;\n1 Peter 3:15\n; “\nEach Life That Touches Ours for Good\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 293.\nInvite sharing.\nIf you are a teacher—at home or at church—“give learners opportunities to share with each other what they are learning about the Savior and His gospel. Doing this will help them internalize the truths they are taught and express them” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n26\n). For example, when studying\nJudges 4\ntogether, you could give each learner something specific to look for in the chapter and then invite them to share with each other what they find.\nJudges 6–8\nThe Lord can work miracles when I trust in His ways.\nAs you read\nJudges 6–8\n, make note of instances where the Lord asked Gideon to believe something that might have seemed unlikely. Has He ever asked something similar of you?\nWhat do you feel the Lord is trying to teach you with this account? How have you seen the Lord do His work in ways that seemed unlikely?\nJudges 13–16\nGod strengthens me as I am faithful to my covenants.\nSamson lost both his physical strength and his spiritual strength because he violated his covenants with God, including those that applied specifically to Nazarites (for information about the Nazarites, see\nNumbers 6:1–6\n;\nJudges 13:7\n). As you read about Samson in\nJudges 13–16\n, note verses that show that the Lord was with Samson, as well as verses showing that Samson was not fully committed to the Lord.\nYou might also ponder the covenants you have made with the Lord. How have these covenants brought His power into your life? What do you learn from Samson’s experiences that inspires you to stay true to your covenants with God?\nSister Ann M. Dibb taught: “Samson was born with great potential. His mother was promised, ‘He shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines’ [\nJudges 13:5\n]. But as Samson grew, he looked more to the world’s temptations than to God’s direction. He made choices because they ‘pleaseth [him] well’ [\nJudges 14:3\n] rather than because those choices were right. Repeatedly, the scriptures use the phrase ‘and he went down’ [\nJudges 14:7\n] as they tell of Samson’s journeys, actions, and choices. Instead of arising and shining forth to fulfill his great potential, Samson was overcome by the world, lost his God-given power, and died a tragic, early death” (“\nArise and Shine Forth\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2012, 118).\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nCovenants and Responsibilities\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 93–96; Ulisses Soares, “\nCovenant Confidence through Jesus Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 17–21.\nStudy Helps\nWhat were some of the false gods of the Canaanites?\nWhat does it mean that Deborah was a prophetess?\nWas it appropriate for Gideon to ask God for a sign?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the first Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “Appendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path.”\nJudges 3:7–9, 12–15\nJesus Christ is my Deliverer.\nJudges 3\ndescribes a pattern that teaches about the Savior’s power to deliver us from sin. To help your children identify this pattern, you could write down these phrases: “did evil,” “cried unto the Lord,” and “raised up a deliverer.” Then your children could look for these phrases in\nJudges 3:7–9\nand\nJudges 3:12–15\n. What do we learn about the Lord from this pattern?\nTo emphasize that Jesus Christ is our Deliverer, you could gather several pictures of people, including a picture of Jesus, and place them face down. Let your children take turns flipping over the pictures. When they find the picture of Jesus, sing a song about Him, such as “\nHe Sent His Son\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 34–35), and tell your children about how He has delivered you.\nJudges 4:1–15\nI can inspire others to have faith in the Lord.\nYou can use “\nDeborah the Prophetess\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 92–95, to tell your children the story in\nJudges 4\n. Share with each other what you admire about Deborah. How did her faith in the Lord bless the people around her? What can we do to help others have more faith in Jesus Christ?\n2:9\nDeborah the Prophetess\nJudges 7:1–21\nThe Lord can use small things to do great work.\nUse\nJudges 7:4–7\n, this week’s activity page, or “\nThe Army of Gideon\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 96–99, to teach your children about how the Lord made Israel’s army smaller. Why did the Lord want Gideon’s army to be so small? (see\nJudges 7:2\n).\n2:37\nThe Army of Gideon\nYour children could draw pictures of a sword, shield, trumpet, lamp, and pitcher and talk about which of these objects they would want in a battle. Then they could read\nJudges 7:16\nto learn what the Lord told Gideon’s army to use. As you read about the battle in\nJudges 7:19–21\n, share with each other what you learn about the Lord from this story.\nSamson Puts Down the Pillars\n, by James Tissot and others\nJudges 13:5\nKeeping covenants gives me strength.\nSamson’s covenants with the Lord gave him physical strength, just as our covenants give us spiritual strength. Your children might enjoy doing some physical exercises and discussing how those exercises can help make our bodies strong. How does keeping our covenants make our spirits strong? (see\nMosiah 18:8–10\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Sometimes we imagine that our lives should follow a clear path from beginning to end. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, after all. And yet life is often full of delays and detours that take us in unexpected directions.\nRuth and Hannah surely understood this. Ruth was not an Israelite, but she married one, and when her husband died, she had a choice to make. Would she return to her family and her old, familiar life, or would she embrace the Israelite faith and a new home with her mother-in-law? (see\nRuth 1:4–18\n). Hannah’s plan for her life was to bear children, but she could not, and that left her “in bitterness of soul” (see\n1 Samuel 1:1–10\n). As you read about Ruth and Hannah, consider the faith they must have had to travel their unexpected paths. Then think about your own journey. It’s different from Ruth’s and Hannah’s—and anyone else’s. But throughout the trials and surprises between here and your eternal destination, you can learn to say with Hannah, “My heart rejoiceth in the Lord” (\n1 Samuel 2:1\n).\nSee also the Bible Dictionary for an overview of the books of\nRuth\nand\n1 Samuel\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nRuth\nJesus Christ can turn tragedy into triumph.\nLife is hard for a widow in any era. But when Ruth’s husband died, her situation was especially hard. In Israelite culture at the time, a woman without a husband or sons had no right to property and very few ways to earn a living. As you read Ruth’s story, notice how the Lord turned tragedy into great blessings. What do you notice about Ruth that might have helped her? How did Boaz redeem Ruth from her desperate situation? (see\nRuth 4:4–10\n). How were both Ruth and Boaz like Jesus Christ?\nSee also “\nBe Still, My Soul\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 124.\nRuth\n;\n1 Samuel 1\nI can trust that God will guide and help me regardless of my situation.\nPerhaps you have suffered a great loss, as Ruth and Naomi did (see\nRuth 1:1–5\n). Or maybe, like Hannah, you long for blessings you have not yet received (see\n1 Samuel 1:1–10\n). How did these women show their faith in God? What do you learn from their examples?\nOf course, not everyone who prays for a child receives one, and not everyone whose spouse dies remarries. But everyone who turns to the Savior receives His help and guidance. Consider how you have “come to trust” the Lord (\nRuth 2:12\n) during your difficult times.\nSee also Amy A. Wright, “\nAbide the Day in Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 9–11.\nFor This Child I Prayed\n, by Elspeth Young\n1 Samuel 2\n;\n4–7\nTo receive the Lord’s help, I need to trust Him and obey His commandments.\nWhen their enemies attacked, the Israelites apparently thought that simply possessing the ark of the covenant would protect them. As you read\n1 Samuel 4–6\n, think about why that didn’t work. (Note also the unrighteous actions of Eli’s sons, who served as priests in the tabernacle, in\n1 Samuel 2:12–25\n.) What do you think the Lord was trying to teach His people? What do you learn from what happened to the Philistines after capturing the ark? (see\nchapters 5–6\n). What do you learn from Israel’s efforts to regain the Lord’s protection in\n1 Samuel 7\n?\nYou might be inspired by reading Hannah’s poem of praise in\n1 Samuel 2:1–10\n. What do you find in her words that could have helped Eli’s sons and the rest of the Israelites?\n1 Samuel 3\nI can hear and obey the voice of the Lord.\nAt times, you may feel like Samuel, who heard the voice of the Lord but did not recognize it. Like all of us, Samuel had to learn how to recognize the Lord’s voice. As you study\n1 Samuel 3\n, what do you learn from this young boy about hearing and obeying the Lord’s voice? You might also search these additional scriptures and make a list of guidelines that can help a person recognize the Lord’s voice:\n1 Kings 19:11–12\n;\nLuke 24:15–32\n;\n3 Nephi 11:3–7\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:22–23\n;\n8:2–3\n;\n9:7–9\n.\nOther times, you may feel that the heavens are shut and that God does not want to communicate with you. President Russell M. Nelson said, “Does God really\nwant\nto speak to you? Yes!” (“\nRevelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 93–96). As you study President Nelson’s message, what do you find that inspires you to hear and obey the voice of the Lord? What does President Nelson invite you to do, and what blessings does he promise? You can also find invitations and promised blessings about revelation in “\nWalk in God’s light\n” (\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n, 16–20). Consider choosing one thing you can do to “increase your spiritual capacity to receive revelation.”\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhat did it mean to glean a field?\nWhy was it significant that Boaz was one of Naomi’s “next kinsmen”?\nWhy did Naomi instruct Ruth to lay at the feet of Boaz?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nRuth\nI can show love and kindness to people around me.\nAs you share with your children the story of Ruth (you could use “\nRuth and Naomi\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 100–103), invite them to raise their hands every time they hear an act of kindness in the story. They could also share how they feel when others are kind to them, or when they are kind to others. How has the Savior been kind to us? How can we follow His example? (see “\nKindness Begins with Me,\n”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 145).\n2:0\nRuth and Naomi\nRuth\n;\n1 Samuel 1\nI can have faith in the Lord.\nThe stories of Ruth and Hannah can inspire your children to stay faithful during hard times. Consider helping them create a simple chart with the headings\nTrials\n,\nActions\n,\nBlessings\n. Then you could read together\nRuth 1:3–5, 8, 16\n;\n2:1–3, 8–12\n;\n4:13–17\n;\n1 Samuel 1:1–18\nand write under the headings what they find in these verses. How did Ruth and Hannah show their faith in the Lord? You or your children could then share examples of how the Lord has blessed you during hard times.\n1 Samuel 1:1–18\nHeavenly Father hears and answers my prayers.\nTo learn about Hannah, your children could read\n1 Samuel 1:1–18\nor “\nHannah\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n(104–5) or watch “Hannah’s Faith” (video, Gospel Library). It might be fun to toss a ball to a child and invite them to tell part of the story before passing the ball to someone else. What do we learn about prayer from Hannah’s example?\n1:15\nHannah\n3:9\nHannah's Faith\nSamuel Tells Eli the Truth\n, by Robert T. Barrett\n1 Samuel 3:1–10\nI can hear and obey the Lord’s voice.\nPerhaps a simple role-play could help your children learn from Samuel’s experience with revelation. One child could pretend to be Samuel, and another could pretend to be Eli as you read\n1 Samuel 3:1–10\n(see also “\nSamuel the Prophet\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 106–9, or the video “Samuel and Eli,” Gospel Library). What do we learn from Samuel about how to hear the voice of the Lord? How do we show that we are willing to hear when the Lord speaks to us?\n2:10\nSamuel the Prophet\n1:58\nSamuel and Eli\nAsk your children how they would explain to someone how the Lord speaks to them. You could help them look for answers in\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:22–23\n;\n8:2–3\n;\n9:7–9\n.\nHelp your children learn to recognize the Spirit.\nIt’s not easy to discern between our own feelings and the Holy Ghost. Everyone struggles with this from time to time. Take every opportunity you can to help your children recognize when they are feeling the influence of the Spirit. For example, as you read\n1 Samuel 3:1–10\nand the suggested verses in the Doctrine and Covenants, you could share experiences in which the Lord has taught you in your mind and heart.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Saul was a keeper of donkeys. Though tall and handsome, he was “little in [his] own sight” and self-conscious about his family heritage (see\n1 Samuel 9:2–3, 21\n;\n15:17\n). On the day he was to be presented before Israel as their king, he didn’t show up; he was so nervous he “hid himself” (\n1 Samuel 10:21–22\n). Looking at Saul, you might not have guessed that he would lead the Israelites to victory over their enemies—or that he would later become prideful and rebel against the Lord.\nDavid was a keeper of sheep. He wasn’t as physically impressive as his seven older brothers. On the day Samuel came to choose a new king for Israel, it didn’t seem worthwhile to include David among the possible candidates, so he was left out in the fields with the sheep. Looking at David, you might not have guessed that he would have the faith and courage to defeat a giant and become Israel’s most successful king.\nBut the Lord sees past our labels, our physical appearance, our insecurities. He looks, instead, “on the heart” (\n1 Samuel 16:7\n). And even when our heart isn’t quite right, if we’re willing, He will give us “another heart” (\n1 Samuel 10:9\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n1 Samuel 8\nJesus Christ is my King.\n1 Samuel 8\ntells of an event that would forever change the destiny of the Israelites. For protection against their enemies, the Israelites wanted what their neighbors had—a king to rule over them. As you read about their request and the Lord’s response, think about who you look to for safety and guidance. Consider what it means to let the Lord “reign over [you]” (\n1 Samuel 8:7\n).\nOver the coming weeks, you will read about a number of kings called to lead Israel. As you learn about them, consider the following questions:\nHow were the Lord’s warnings fulfilled in\n1 Samuel 8:10–18\n?\nHow were the children of Israel affected by their choice to have an earthly king?\nHow is Jesus Christ different from earthly kings? Consider what worldly influences you may need to remove from your life to let Christ be your King.\nSee also “\nRejoice, the Lord Is King!\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 66.\n1 Samuel 9–10\n;\n16:1–13\nGod calls people by prophecy to serve in His kingdom.\nRead about how God chose Israel’s kings in\n1 Samuel 9–10\nand\n16\n(see especially\n9:15–17\n;\n10:1–12\n;\n16:1–13\n). Look for passages that help you understand what it means to “be called of God, by prophecy” in the Lord’s Church today (\nArticles of Faith 1:5\n). You might consider putting yourself in the place of the leader extending the calling (Samuel), the person being called (Saul and David), and the people they are called to serve (the Israelites). What do you learn from their words and actions in these chapters?\nIllustration of Samuel anointing Saul, by P. Mann, © Lifeway Collection/licensed from\ngoodsalt.com\n1 Samuel 13:5–14\n;\n15\n“To obey is better than sacrifice.”\nConsidering how timid Saul seemed in\n1 Samuel 10\n, it’s surprising to read about his “rebellion” and “stubbornness” after he became king (\n1 Samuel 15:23\n). Why do you think this happened? In\n1 Samuel 13:5–14\n, what attitudes and behaviors do you see that led to his downfall?\nIn\n1 Samuel 15\n, you’ll read about a commandment from the Lord that Saul didn’t obey because he thought he had a good reason. To learn from Saul’s poor choices, look at\nverse 22\nand replace the words “sacrifice” and “fat of rams” with things that seem good but are not as important as hearing and obeying the Lord. How have you been blessed as you’ve put the Lord’s will first in your life?\n1 Samuel 16:6–12\n“The Lord looketh on the heart.”\nHave you ever made a decision based on “the outward appearance” of something or someone, only to find out that you were wrong? Maybe you ate something that wasn’t as good as it looked. Or maybe you judged someone unfairly.\nWhen Samuel was looking for a new king of Israel, the Lord taught him a better way. Read about it in\n1 Samuel 16:6–7\n, and consider making a list of ways people judge others “on the outward appearance.” You can find some examples in Elder Christophe G. Giraud-Carrier’s message “\nWe Are His Children\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 114–16). What does it mean to look “on the heart,” as the Lord does? (\n1 Samuel 16:7\n). You can find examples of this, too, in Elder Giraud-Carrier’s message. Maybe you can think of other times when the Savior looked past a person’s outward appearance. (See, for instance,\nMark 12:41–44\n;\nLuke 5:1–11\n;\n19:1–9\n;\nJohn 4:5–30\n;\nMoses 6:31–36\n.) What do you learn from these examples?\nHow can you follow the Savior’s example in the way you see others—and yourself? How might doing so affect your interactions with others? Consider telling someone about the goodness you see in their heart.\nSee also Ulisses Soares, “\nBrothers and Sisters in Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 70–73.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhy was it wrong for Saul to perform a burnt offering?\nWhat was the purpose of David’s anointing?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n1 Samuel 8\nJesus Christ is my King.\nAs you read\n1 Samuel 8\nwith your children, help them find reasons Samuel told the Israelites that having a king was a bad idea. Why is it better to have Jesus Christ as our king? Maybe you could make a paper crown together and take turns wearing it and sharing something we can do to show that we want Jesus to be our King. (See also\nJeremiah 23:5\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:59\n.)\n1 Samuel 8:6\n;\n9:15–17\n;\n10:1–24\n;\n16:1–13\nPeople who serve in the Church are called by God.\nThe accounts of God choosing Saul and David to be kings can help your children understand how people are called to serve in the Church today by revelation. To teach them these stories, you could write down events from the stories on strips of paper, and your children could put them in the correct order as you read the scripture passages together (see also “\nYoung David\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 110–11). Then you could talk about times when God blessed you with spiritual power to fulfill an assignment or calling (see\n1 Samuel 10:9–10\n).\n1:16\nYoung David\nThis might also be a good time to teach your children the\nfifth article of faith\n. Tell them how you received your calling in the Church. How do you know that you were called of God?\nThe Prophet Samuel Anoints David to Be King of Israel in Bethlehem\n, by Balage Balogh\n1 Samuel 16:1–13\nThe Lord looks on the heart.\nAn object lesson could help your children understand the principle in\n1 Samuel 16:7\n. For example, you could show them some food or a book with a wrapper or cover that doesn’t match its true contents. What do\n1 Samuel 16:7\nand this object lesson suggest about how we should view ourselves and other people? Sing a song that emphasizes this principle, such as “\nLove One Another\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 136).\nUse object lessons.\nWhen your children have something to see and touch related to a gospel principle, they’re more likely to remember it. For instance, as you read\n1 Samuel 16:7\nwith them, you could let them help you find examples of optical illusions to illustrate the point that we should try to see as the Lord does—by looking “on the heart”—rather than judgments based on “the outward appearance.”\nYou and your children could share experiences in which you learned why you should “look on the heart,” not just “the outward appearance” (\nverse 7\n). You might also take turns telling each other about the good qualities you see in each other’s hearts.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Ever since the tribes of Israel had settled in the promised land, the Philistines had been an ongoing threat to their safety. The Lord had delivered them many times in the past, but now the elders of Israel demanded, “We will have a king … [to] go out before us, and fight our battles” (\n1 Samuel 8:19–20\n). So Saul was anointed king. And yet when the menacing giant Goliath hurled his challenge to the armies of Israel, Saul—like the rest of his army—was “greatly afraid” (\n1 Samuel 17:11\n). On that day, it wasn’t King Saul who saved Israel but a humble shepherd boy named David, who was wearing no armor but was clothed with impenetrable faith in the Lord. This battle proved to Israel, and to anyone who has spiritual battles to fight, that “the Lord saveth not with sword and spear” and that “the battle is the Lord’s” (\n1 Samuel 17:47\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n1 Samuel 17\nWith the help of the Lord, I can overcome any challenge.\nThe story of David and Goliath is one of the best-known stories in the scriptures. Of course, we usually focus on David. But this time, as you study\n1 Samuel 17\n, ponder also the words of other people in this chapter (see the list below). What do you learn about them and their motives? What do you learn about David? How is he different?\nGoliath:\nverses 8–10, 43–44\nEliab:\nverse 28\nSaul:\nverse 33\nDavid:\nverses 26, 32, 34–37, 39, 45–47\nYour story, though not as well-known as David’s, is sure to include Goliath-size challenges to overcome and opportunities to exercise faith in the Lord. What does David’s example teach you about facing the adversity in your story? You might also read President Camille N. Johnson’s message “\nInvite Christ to Author Your Story\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 80–82) with one of your challenges in mind. Look for answers to questions like these: How does the Lord want me to view my challenges? How has He helped me in the past? How can I show that I trust Him to write my story?\nYou may already know that there are some tragic chapters later in David’s story (see, for example,\n2 Samuel 11\n). If you had the opportunity to give David some advice after his battle with Goliath, what would you say? How might this advice apply to your life?\nSee also “The Lord Will Deliver Me” (video), Gospel Library.\n3:24\nThe Lord Will Deliver Me\n1 Samuel 17:26–50\nOne person with faith in Christ can make a difference.\nIn addition to personal challenges, we also face large, complex problems that affect the whole world. When forces of evil are “gathered together … to battle” against the forces of good (\n1 Samuel 17:1\n), we might wonder how our individual efforts could possibly make a difference. What do you find in David’s story that gives you hope? Sister Andrea M. Spannaus taught that the five stones David carried into his battle with Goliath could represent things we need to win our spiritual battles. Read her message “\nFaithful to the End\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 59–61). How can you access these sources of strength in your life?\nSee also “\nLet Us All Press On\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 243.\nTrue Friendship and Self-Respect\n, by Wilson Ong (detail)\n1 Samuel 18\n“Jonathan loved [David] as his own soul.”\nAs you read\n1 Samuel 18\n, consider contrasting Saul and his son Jonathan (who, if not for David, could have assumed he would be the next king). How did Saul and Jonathan react to David’s success? What can you learn from this experience?\nWhat do you find in Jonathan’s attitudes and actions that reminds you of Jesus Christ?\n“Liken the scriptures” (\n1 Nephi 19:23\n).\nThe scriptures provide great opportunities to learn from the motivations and actions of people like David, Jonathan, and Saul. You’ll find that no one in the scriptures is flawless. So as you read, for example, about David’s faithful choices, be open to learning also from his mistakes. Doing so can help us identify potential weaknesses in ourselves and “learn to be more wise than [others] have been” (\nMormon 9:31\n).\n1 Samuel 24–26\nForgiveness is the sure path to peace and healing.\nIn\n1 Samuel 24–26\n, look for lessons about pride, forgiveness, and self-control. You might also consider reading Elder Mark A. Bragg’s message “\nChristlike Poise\n” as part of your study (\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 60–63). How did David, Abigail, and others demonstrate—or fail to demonstrate—Christlike poise in these chapters? What opportunities do you have to show Christlike poise?\nSister Kristen Yee’s message “\nBeauty for Ashes: The Healing Path of Forgiveness\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 36–39) can help you study\n1 Samuel 25\n. How is Abigail like Jesus Christ?\n2 Samuel 5:17–25\nThe Lord can give me direction.\nEven after David defeated Goliath, his problems with the Philistines were not over. As you read\n2 Samuel 5:17–25\n, consider how David’s example can help you in the challenges you face (see also\n1 Samuel 23:2, 10–11\n;\n30:8\n;\n2 Samuel 2:1\n). How are you being blessed by acting on the revelation you receive?\n2 Samuel 7\nWhat is the “house” the Lord promised to David?\nWhen David offered to build a house, meaning a temple, for the Lord (see\n2 Samuel 7:1–3\n), the Lord responded that David’s\nson\nwould build it (see\nverses 12–15\n; see also\n1 Chronicles 17:1–15\n). The Lord also said that He in turn would build David a “house,” meaning a posterity, and that his throne would last forever (see\n2 Samuel 7:11, 16, 25–29\n;\nPsalm 89:3–4, 35–37\n). This promise was fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our Eternal King, who was a descendant of David (see\nMatthew 1:1\n;\nLuke 1:32–33\n;\nJohn 18:33–37\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhat is meant by the title “Lord of Hosts”?\nWhy was Uzzah smitten by God for trying to steady the ark?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n1 Samuel 17:20–54\nFaith in Jesus Christ can help me have courage.\nYou may want to use “\nDavid and Goliath\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 112–16, to help your children become familiar with what happened in\n1 Samuel 17:20–54\n. Then you could let them retell the story using the pictures or line drawings in this outline. Ask them what they think the Lord wants them to learn from this story.\n2:36\nDavid and Goliath\nYou and your children could also make a list of some difficult challenges they might face during their life. Then help them find things David said that can help with these challenges (see\n1 Samuel 17:26, 32, 34–37, 45–47\n). Share how Jesus Christ has helped you during challenges.\nYour children could march like they are David going to fight Goliath while singing a song about being courageous, such as “\nI Will Be Valiant\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 162).\n1 Samuel 18:1–4\nGood friends can be a blessing from God.\nHow can you help your children learn from Jonathan and David’s friendship? One way would be to give each child two paper hearts, one to represent David and the other to represent Jonathan. Then read together a few phrases from\n1 Samuel 18:1–4\nthat emphasize the love these two friends felt for each other. Your children could then write or draw on their paper hearts how they can show love to a friend.\n2 Samuel 5:19, 23\nIf I need guidance, I can ask Heavenly Father.\nIn these chapters, David became the king of Israel. It might be fun for your children to pretend to be a king or queen. What laws would they make? Where would they go for help? Help your children discover that when David needed help, he “inquired,” or prayed, for answers. For example, as you read\n2 Samuel 5:19, 23\n, invite the children to listen for the word “inquired” and to fold their arms when they hear it. Why would David need the Lord’s help in his new role?\nTell each other about times when you prayed for Heavenly Father’s help. What difference did it make to have Him help you?\n2 Samuel 7:16–17\nJesus Christ is my Eternal King.\nThe kings we read about in the Old Testament all had flaws, and their kingdoms all ended. But Jesus Christ is a perfect King and will reign forever. You can help your children discover this by reading together what the prophet Nathan told King David in\n2 Samuel 7:16–17\n. How could David’s kingdom have no end? Help your children find and read scripture passages that teach that Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, is our King, such as\nLuke 1:32–33\n;\nJohn 18:33–37\n; and\nRevelation 19:16\n. How is Jesus different from earthly kings? How do we honor Jesus Christ as our Eternal King?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Saul, David, and Solomon, the first three kings of Israel, all started out with so much promise. Humble, courageous, and wise, they each found favor with the Lord—at least at first. Sadly, each king also gave in to human weaknesses and temptation. They put their own desires before the Lord’s. And as we’ve seen over and over in the scriptures—and in our own lives—that led to tragedy.\nBut something important happened during the reign of Solomon that provided some hope for stability in the lives of the covenant people. Solomon built a temple. It was to be a more permanent house of the Lord than the tabernacle had been. And it would represent a more permanent presence of the Lord among His people. Solomon knew that the people would continue to face weakness and trials of various kinds. In dedicating the new holy house, Solomon pleaded with the Lord, “If they … return unto thee with all their heart, … then hear thou their prayer” (\n1 Kings 8:47–48\n). That’s part of what temple covenants do for us—they create a connection to God. They secure for us the promise that through our repentance and His mercy, He can “dwell among [us]” and never forsake us (\n1 Kings 6:13\n).\nFor an overview of the book of 1 Kings, see “\nKings, books of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Samuel 11\n;\n12:1–14\nThe Lord can help me make good choices when I am tempted to sin.\nSometimes we look at people who seem strong in their faith, and we assume that they are unaffected by temptation. David’s tragic choices described in\n2 Samuel 11\nclearly show that this isn’t the case. Consider what lessons you can learn from his experiences. Questions like these might help you study\n2 Samuel 11–12\n:\nWhat choices did David make that led him down an increasingly sinful path? What righteous choices could he have made instead? (See also the video “To Look Upon,” Gospel Library.)\n4:15\nTo Look Upon\nUsing videos.\nVideos can help you visualize accounts from the scriptures and consider how they apply to you. Consider how you can use them to enhance teaching and learning. For example, while watching “To Look Upon” (Gospel Library), consider pausing the video at various points to ponder or discuss some of the questions suggested in this activity.\nHow is the adversary trying to lead you down sinful paths? What choices could you make now to stay spiritually safe?\nNote David’s reaction to Nathan’s story in\n2 Samuel 12:1–6\n. What does his reaction suggest about how David viewed himself? What has the Lord done to help you see yourself more accurately?\nHow would you summarize the events of\n2 Samuel 11–12\nin a one-sentence warning?\nReading about David’s bad choices could lead you to learn about the dangers of pornography and sexual sin. A good resource for this is\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n, especially the sections titled “\nWhat to do in the moment\n” and “\nYour body is sacred\n” (pages 21–28). Maybe you could look in that resource for counsel that would have helped David make better choices. Or you could read “\nJesus Christ will help you\n” (pages 6–9), looking for something that would have helped David return to the Lord.\nConsider singing a hymn like “\nI Need Thee Every Hour\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 98) and pondering how the Savior has strengthened you when you’ve faced temptation.\nSee also\n2 Nephi 28:20–24\n; Ulisses Soares, “\nSeek Christ in Every Thought\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 82–85; “\nTaking Charge of Technology\n,” Gospel Library; “Watch Your Step” (video), Gospel Library.\n2:36\nWatch Your Step\n1 Kings 3:1–15\nThe gift of discernment helps me distinguish between right and wrong.\nIf the Lord said to you, “Ask what I shall give thee” (\n1 Kings 3:5\n), what would you ask for? What impresses you about Solomon’s request? Ponder why “an understanding heart” to “discern between good and bad” (\nverse 9\n) is a valuable gift. What can you do to seek this gift?\nSee also\nMoroni 7:12–19\n.\n1 Kings 6–8\n;\n9:1–9\nThrough covenants made in the Lord’s house, the Lord dwells with me.\nIn\n1 Kings 6–7\nyou’ll find a detailed description of the sacred house that Solomon built for the Lord. The details may not seem as important to you as they were to the ancient Israelites. But reading these chapters might give you a sense for how important it was to them to have a house of the Lord. Why is it important to you?\nYou might ponder what the different parts of Solomon’s temple might symbolize. For example, consider what the cherubim, trees, and flowers in\n1 Kings 6:35\nmight represent. (See also\nGenesis 3:24\n.)\nChapter 8\nrecords Solomon’s prayer upon completing the temple (see\nverses 22–61\n). Consider making a list of the blessings Solomon asked for. What impresses you about these blessings? (Note also the Lord’s promises in\n2 Kings 6:11–13\n;\n9:1–9\n.) If you’ve been to the Lord’s house, think about your experiences worshipping there. How has keeping temple covenants helped you access the Lord’s blessings?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 109\n; Henry B. Eyring, “\nI Love to See the Temple\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 28–31.\nBarranquilla Colombia Temple\n1 Kings 8:61\n;\n11:1–11\n“His heart was not perfect with the Lord.”\nWhat does it mean to “let your heart … be perfect with the Lord”? (\n1 Kings 8:61\n). Is that different from our actions being perfect? How so? Read\n1 Kings 11:1–11\n, and notice what the Lord said about Solomon’s heart. You might ponder whether there are influences in your life that could turn your heart away from the Lord and toward “other gods.”\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWho was Nathan?\nWhat was the molten sea on the back of 12 oxen?\nWhat does it mean that the Lord would put His name upon the temple?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n2 Samuel 11\nThe Lord can help me when I am tempted.\n“\nKing David\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 117–20, can help you tell your children the story in\n2 Samuel 11\n. You might ask your children to identify the wrong choices David made and suggest good choices he could have made instead. What are some things we can do when we are being tempted that can help us make the right choice?\n2:11\nKing David\nReading about David’s tragic sins might be a good opportunity to discuss the dangers of pornography. The video “What Should I Do When I See Pornography?” (Gospel Library) has helpful guidance. Help your children make a plan about what they will do when they encounter pornography.\n5:46\nWhat should I do when I see pornography?\n1 Kings 8:22–61\nMaking covenants in the Lord’s house—and keeping them—helps me walk in His ways.\nAs you and your children learn about the dedication of the temple in\n1 Kings 8\n, you could look at the pictures of temples in this week’s outline. Let your children talk about details they see in the pictures. You might emphasize\nverses 57–58\n. What does it mean to “walk in all [the Lord’s] ways”? (\n1 Kings 8:58\n). Maybe your children could take a step for each answer they give.\nTell your children how keeping the covenants you make in the temple helps you walk in the Lord’s ways. You might tell them what these covenants are (see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n27.2\n, Gospel Library). You could also sing a song together like “\nI Love to See the Temple\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 95).\nIllustration of Solomon’s temple, by Sam Lawlor\n1 Kings 11:1–11\nI can put the Lord first in my life.\nReading about how Solomon’s wives influenced him could lead to a conversation about examples of “other gods”—or things that people worship or love instead of the Lord. How do we show that we love Him more than anything else in our lives?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "The house of Israel was in disarray. The kingdom had divided, with ten tribes forming the Northern Kingdom of Israel and two tribes forming the Southern Kingdom of Judah. But worse than their separation from each other was both kingdoms’ separation from their covenants. Wicked kings led the people away from the Lord, and many people wavered in their faith.\nIn this setting, the Lord called Elijah to be a prophet. His life shows that a person can have great faith in the Lord even in bad circumstances. Sometimes the Lord responds to such faith with impressive, public miracles, like fire falling from heaven. But He also works quiet, private miracles, like feeding a faithful widow and her son. And most often the Lord’s miracles are so individual that they are known only to one person—for example, when the Lord reveals Himself to you through “a still small voice” (\n1 Kings 19:12\n).\nFor more about Elijah, see “\nElijah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n1 Kings 12:1–20\nChristlike leaders serve the people they lead.\nHow would you describe the mistake King Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, made in\n1 Kings 12:1–14\n? What Christlike attributes could have helped Rehoboam save his kingdom? (see\nverse 7\n;\nMatthew 20:25–28\n;\nMosiah 2:10–21\n). How can you use these attributes as a leader—whether in a Church calling or as a leader of your own life?\n1 Kings 17:8–16\n;\n19:19–21\nAn invitation to sacrifice is an opportunity to exercise my faith in Jesus Christ.\nThe prophet Elijah asked a widow to give him food and water before feeding herself and her starving son. Why would he do that? Elijah’s request could be seen as a blessing for this small family. They needed the Lord’s blessings, and sacrifice brings blessings—including the blessing of stronger faith.\nAs you read\n1 Kings 17:8–16\n, imagine you were this widow. What impresses you about her? You could also make a list of choices that require faith in Jesus Christ (for examples, see\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide to Making Choices\n[2022]). What do you learn from this widow about exercising faith?\nHow are Elisha’s actions in\n1 Kings 19:19–21\nsimilar to the widow’s actions?\nThink about sacrifices you’ve made to follow the Savior. What does\n1 Kings 17:8–16\n;\n19:19–21\nteach you about these sacrifices? How does your knowledge of the Savior help you when He asks you to make sacrifices? How has He blessed you?\nSee also\nMatthew 4:18–22\n;\n6:25–33\n;\nLuke 4:24–26\n; “Elijah and the Widow of Zarephath” (video), Gospel Library; “\nWhen Faith Endures\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 128.\n10:13\nElijah and the Widow of Zarephath\n1 Kings 18\n“If the Lord be God, follow him.”\nThe Israelites might have felt they had good reasons to worship Baal, who was known as the god of storms and rain. After three years of drought, they desperately needed rain. And worshipping Baal was socially accepted and promoted by the king and queen. As you read\n1 Kings 18\n, think about why someone in our day might be indecisive about following the Lord. In this chapter, what do you think the Lord was trying to teach about Himself? What experiences have helped you commit to following the Savior?\nSee also D. Todd Christofferson, “\nChoice and Commitment\n” (worldwide devotional for young adults, Jan. 12, 2020), Gospel Library.\nIllustration of Elijah, by Wilson Ong\n1 Kings 19:1–18\nThe Lord often speaks in quiet, simple ways.\nSadly, the miracle on Mount Carmel didn’t make Elijah’s mission any easier. In fact, his life was in danger, and he had to hide in a cave in the wilderness. There, struggling with loneliness and discouragement, he had an experience with the Lord that was very different from the experience on Mount Carmel. What does Elijah’s experience in\n1 Kings 19:1–18\nteach you about how the Lord communicates with you in your times of need?\nPonder times when you feel the Lord has spoken to you. How would you describe the way He communicates with you? Why are the words “still” and “small” good ways to describe the voice of the Spirit? What other words do you find in\nHelaman 5:30\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:22–23\n;\n11:12–14\n? What do you need to do to receive the Lord’s guidance more often?\nSee also\nPsalm 46:10\n.\nUse multiple senses to enhance learning.\nWe all learn about the world through our five senses. Using those senses can also enhance gospel learning. For example, think of images or sounds you could use to illustrate the words “still” and “small” as you learn or teach about the Lord’s voice in\n1 Kings 19\n.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n1 Kings 17\nThe Lord blesses me as I have faith in Him.\nTo help your children learn the stories of faith in\n1 Kings 17\n, you could show them pictures or objects to illustrate the stories, such as birds, bread, or a boy. As you tell your children these stories, invite them to find the picture or object that goes with each story. “\nElijah the Prophet\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 121–24) can help you tell these stories. What does each story teach us about showing faith in Jesus Christ?\n1:58\nElijah the Prophet\nHelp your children think of ways they can show their faith in Jesus Christ. Sing with them a song about faith, such as “I Have Faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ” (Gospel Library), and share with each other what you learn about faith from the song.\nIllustration of Elijah and the healing of the widow’s son, by Charles Edmund Brock\n1 Kings 17:8–16\nWhen the Lord asks me to sacrifice, I can obey in faith.\nPerhaps your children could draw a picture of what the Lord asked the widow to give Elijah (see\n1 Kings 17:12–13\n) and what the widow received in return (see\n1 Kings 17:15–16\n). (See also this week’s activity page.) They could also look for pictures of other people who gave up something they wanted for something better. Invite your children to find pictures in the\nGospel Art Book\nor\nCome, Follow Me\n. What does the Lord ask us to sacrifice? How does He bless us?\n1 Kings 18:17–39\nI can choose to follow Jesus Christ.\nAs you read\n1 Kings 18:17–39\ntogether, your children could pick a verse and draw a picture of what it describes. They could use their pictures to tell the story in their own words. (See also “\nElijah and the Priests of Baal\n,” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 125–28.)\n2:17\nElijah and the Priests of Baal\nHelp your children think of situations when they might need to decide whether or not to follow Jesus Christ. Maybe they could draw pictures of themselves making the right choice. Share with each other why you choose to follow Jesus.\n1 Kings 19:9–12\nThe Lord speaks to me through the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost.\nAs you summarize\n1 Kings 19:9–12\n, invite your children to do actions to represent the strong wind, the earthquake, and the fire. Then invite them to sit still as you say together, in a quiet voice, “after the fire a still small voice” (\nverse 12\n). (See also “\nThe Lord Speaks to Elijah\n,” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 129–31.) Tell your children about times when you have experienced the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost.\n1:48\nThe Lord Speaks to Elijah\nQuietly sing a song about the Spirit, such as “\nThe Still Small Voice\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 106–7).

        "content": "A prophet’s main mission is to teach and testify of the Savior Jesus Christ. Our record of the prophet Elisha, however, doesn’t include much of his teaching or testifying. What the record does include is the miracles Elisha performed, including raising a child from the dead (see\n2 Kings 4:18–37\n), feeding a multitude with just a little food (see\n2 Kings 4:42–44\n), and healing a leper (see\n2 Kings 5:1–14\n). So while we don’t have Elisha’s words about Christ, we do have Elisha’s ministry and miracles, which do testify of Christ. They are powerful manifestations of the Lord’s life-giving, nourishing, and healing power. Miracles happen more often in our lives than we sometimes realize. To see them, we need to seek the faith Elisha had when he prayed on behalf of his fearful young servant: “Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see” (\n2 Kings 6:17\n).\nFor more information about 2 Kings, see “\nKings, books of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Kings 2–6\nGod can work miracles in my life.\nMiracles show us God’s power. They can help us overcome the difficulties of mortality—like a barren land that needs pure water (see\n2 Kings 2:19–22\n) or a lost ax that needs to be recovered (see\n2 Kings 6:4–7\n). But most importantly, miracles can turn us to the Lord. As you read\n2 Kings 2–6\n, consider listing the miracles you find, and ponder the spiritual lessons you learn from each one.\nYou might also compare the miracles Elisha performed with miracles that Jesus Christ performed (see\n2 Kings 4:8–37\nand\nLuke 7:11–16\n;\n2 Kings 4:42–44\nand\nJohn 6:1–13\n;\n2 Kings 5:1–15\nand\nLuke 17:11–19\n).

As you read\n2 Kings 4:8–17\n;\n7:1–16\n, think about how you respond to the word of the Lord through His prophets today. What teachings, prophecies, or promises have you heard from living prophets? What are you doing to act in faith on their words?\nSee also\n3 Nephi 29:6\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:37–38\n; “\nTeachings of Presidents” collection\n, Gospel Library.\n2 Kings 5\nAs I am humble and obedient, Jesus Christ can heal me.\nAs you read\n2 Kings 5\n, consider comparing Naaman’s leprosy with a spiritual challenge you are facing.\nIs there someone like the “little maid” in your life, encouraging you to seek guidance about your challenge from the Lord’s prophets? (see\nverses 2–3, 13\n).\nWhat is the Lord inviting you to do that might seem too simple—like “wash, and be clean”? (\nverse 13\n). What might be keeping you from accepting His simple invitations?\nHow can you show humility as Naaman did?\nNote how Naaman’s experience affected his faith in the God of Israel (see\nverse 15\n). What can you learn from this?\nSee also\nLuke 4:27\n;\n1 Peter 5:5–7\n;\nAlma 37:3–7\n;\nEther 12:27\n; L. Whitney Clayton, “\nWhatsoever He Saith unto You, Do It\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 97–99; “Naaman and Elisha” (video), Gospel Library.\n14:30\nNaaman and Elisha\nCompare the scriptures to your life.\nSometimes it’s easier to find personal meaning in the scriptures when you compare physical things in a story with spiritual things in your life. For example, while you study\n2 Kings 2–7\n, you could compare situations in your life to things like leprosy, a borrowed ax, the Jordan River, or a large invading army. What lessons might the Lord have for you in these accounts?\n2 Kings 6:8–23\n“They that be with us are more than they that be with them.”\nAs you try to follow Christ, have you ever felt like Elisha’s young servant—outnumbered and fearful? Imagine you were in his place as you read\n2 Kings 6:8–23\n. How does this story change the way you think and feel about your trials, your responsibilities, or your efforts to live the gospel?\nAs you ponder, consider President Henry B. Eyring’s words: “Like that servant of Elisha, there are more with you than those you can see opposed to you. Some who are with you will be invisible to your mortal eyes. The Lord will bear you up and will at times do it by calling others to stand with you” (“\nO Ye That Embark\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2008, 58).\nConsider making a list of “they that be with [you]” (\nverse 16\n)—people God has placed in your life to support you. You might ask Him to help you identify them by opening your spiritual eyes. He has probably also placed you in others’ lives to help them. How can you draw strength and support from each other?\nWhen have you felt the support that the Lord describes in\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:88\n?\nYou might also study Sister Michelle D. Craig’s message “\nEyes to See\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 15–17). Ask yourself, “What does God want me to see?”\nReferring to the story in\n2 Kings 6:8–23\n, Elder Ronald A. Rasband said: “We may or may not have chariots of fire sent to dispel our fears and conquer our demons, but the lesson is clear. The Lord is with us, mindful of us and blessing us in ways only He can do. Prayer can call down the strength and the revelation that we need to center our thoughts on Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice. The Lord knew that at times we would feel fear. I have been there and so have you. … In this Church we may be few in number by the way the world counts influence, but when we open our spiritual eyes, ‘they that be with us are more than they that be with them’ [\n2 Kings 6:16\n]” (“\nBe Not Troubled\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 18, 19). How would you use these words to help someone who feels anxious or afraid?\nSee also “\nDearest Children, God Is Near You\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 96.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n2 Kings 4\nGod can work miracles in my life.\nAfter helping your children understand what a miracle is, invite them to list as many examples of miracles as they can. Pictures in the\nGospel Art Book\nor\nCome, Follow Me\ncan help. Then they could look for miracles in\n2 Kings 4:1–7, 14–17, 32–35, 38–44\n. What do these miracles teach about Heavenly Father?\nYou and your children could talk about how God has shown His love through miracles. You could also sing together a song such as “God’s Gracious Love” (Gospel Library).\nStand as a Witness\n, by Kwani Povi Winder\n2 Kings 5:1–15\nI can choose to do what God commands through His prophet.\nHelp your children learn the story in\n2 Kings 5:1–3, 9–14\n. Consider using “\nElisha Heals Naaman\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 134–37) or the picture of Naaman in this week’s outline. Why didn’t Naaman want to wash in the Jordan River, even though Elisha said that this would heal his disease? How was Naaman blessed when he followed Elisha’s instructions? You might share with each other experiences when you obeyed the Lord, even when you weren’t sure you wanted to.\n1:52\nElisha Heals Naaman\nYou might also emphasize\n2 Kings 5:13\n, where Naaman’s servants helped him decide to obey the prophet Elisha. Your children could then talk about ways they can help their friends or family members listen to and obey the prophet.\n2 Kings 6:8–17\nI am not alone.\nYou and your children could imagine you are surrounded by an army with swords, horses, and chariots. How would you feel? What would you do? Your children could then close their eyes while you read\n2 Kings 6:16–17\nto them. (See also “\nElisha and the Lord’s Army\n,” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 138–39, or the picture at the end of this outline.) When you get to the words “open his eyes” (\nverse 17\n), ask the children to open their eyes. Talk about what the servant saw. Share with your children ways you have felt that the Lord was with you during your challenges, even when it seemed like you were alone.\n1:9\nElisha and the Lord’s Army\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Despite the prophet Elisha’s powerful ministry, the people of the Northern Kingdom of Israel did not repent. Eventually, the Assyrian Empire conquered and scattered the ten tribes of Israel. Meanwhile, the Southern Kingdom of Judah wasn’t doing much better: idolatry was also widespread there.\nAmid all this spiritual decay, the scriptures mention two kings of Judah who, for a time, turned their people back to the Lord. One was Hezekiah. During his reign, the Assyrians conquered much of Judah. But Hezekiah and his people showed faith in the Lord, who saved Jerusalem in a miraculous way. Later, after another period of apostasy, Josiah became king. Inspired in part by a rediscovery of the book of the law of Moses, Josiah brought reforms that revived the religious life of his people.\nLike Israel and Judah, we all make both good and bad choices. When we sense that our lives need some reforms, we can take encouragement from these two bright spots in the dark years of Judah’s history. Perhaps the examples of Hezekiah and Josiah can inspire us to “trust in the Lord our God” (\n2 Kings 18:22\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Kings 18–19\nI can stay true to the Lord when my faith is challenged.\nMost of us have experiences that challenge our faith. For Hezekiah and his people, one of those challenges came when the Assyrian army approached Jerusalem. As you read\n2 Kings 18–19\n, imagine that you lived in Jerusalem during this time. How might you have felt, for example, hearing the Assyrians’ taunts in\n2 Kings 18:28–37\n;\n19:10–13\n? What would you have done? Compare the Assyrians’ reasons for the Israelites not to trust the Lord with the reasons Satan gives for us to doubt our faith today. You could also contrast the Assyrians’ reasons with your reasons why you\ndo\ntrust the Lord.\nWhat do you learn from Hezekiah’s actions in this situation? (see\n2 Kings 19:1–7, 14–19\n). How did the Lord respond? (see\n2 Kings 19:35–37\n). Why do you think Hezekiah remained faithful? (see\n2 Kings 18:5–7\n). Ponder how the Lord has sustained you in challenging times. What do you feel inspired to do to increase your trust in Him?\nPresident Jeffrey R. Holland’s message “\nFear Not: Believe Only!\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 34–36) has helpful counsel for times of fear or doubt. A hymn like “\nLet Us All Press On\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 243) could also have encouraging messages. What do you find in these resources that helps you?\nSee also\n2 Chronicles 31–32\n;\n3 Nephi 3–4\n; Jörg Klebingat, “\nValiant Discipleship in the Latter Days\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 107–10.\nUse scripture study helps.\nThe Church provides many resources to help you understand the scriptures. For example, in the Gospel Library you can find the\nGuide to the Scriptures\n,\nTopics and Questions\n, and\nChurch magazines\n. In addition, as you read the Old Testament, you can find helpful context and insights in the “Thoughts to Keep in Mind” articles in\nCome, Follow Me\n. The article titled “J\nesus Will Say to All Israel, ‘Come Home’\n” might help your study of\n2 Kings 16–25\n.\n2 Kings 19:20–37\nAll things are in the Lord’s hands.\nSennacherib, the king of Assyria, had good reason to believe that his army would conquer Jerusalem (see\n2 Kings 17\n;\n18:33–34\n;\n19:11–13\n). But the Lord had a message regarding Sennacherib, given through the prophet Isaiah. It’s recorded in\n2 Kings 19:20–34\n. What truths do you find in the Lord’s message that help you have faith in Him and His plan?\n2 Kings 21–23\nThe scriptures can turn my heart to the Lord.\nHave you ever felt that you were lacking something spiritually? Maybe you felt that your relationship with God could be stronger. What helped you turn back to Him? Ponder these questions as you read\n2 Kings 21–23\n, which describes how the Kingdom of Judah fell away from the Lord under King Manasseh (see\n2 Kings 21\n) and how King Josiah helped the people turn back to Him (see\n2 Kings 22–23\n). How and why did Josiah and his people change? (see\n2 Kings 22:8–11\n;\n23:1–6, 21, 24\n).\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball called the story of King Josiah “one of the finest stories in all of the scriptures” (\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball\n[2006], 62). Read President Kimball’s words about King Josiah (\npages 62–64\n). Perhaps you can think of an experience when a passage of scripture “work[ed] mightily” in you. What might you do to receive more experiences like that?\nSee also\nAlma 31:5\n; “Josiah and the Book of the Law” (video), Gospel Library.\n12:25\nJosiah and the Book of the Law\n2 Kings 23:1–25\nA covenant is a whole-souled commitment between me and the Lord.\nWhat impresses you about the covenant Josiah made in\n2 Kings 23:3\n? As you continue reading\nchapter 23\n, notice what Josiah did to show his commitment to the Lord (see also the picture at the end of this outline). How can you show your commitment to Him?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n2 Kings 18:3–6\n;\n19:14–19\nI can trust Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nIn\n2 Kings 18:3, 5–6\n, help your children discover what made Hezekiah a good king. Then as you read together\n2 Kings 19:14–19\n, they could discover how he showed that he trusted the Lord. You could look at a picture of Jesus and talk about why we can trust Him. How can we show that we trust the Lord?\n2 Kings 22:1–7\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ can trust me.\nIn\n2 Kings 22:1\n, help your children discover how old Josiah was when he became king. What do we learn about Josiah in\nverse 2\n? Consider an activity that could illustrate following the Lord and not turning “aside to the right hand or to the left.”\nThe workers described in\n2 Kings 22:3–7\nwere trusted with the money to rebuild the temple “because they dealt faithfully” (\nverse 7\n). After reading these verses, you and your children could talk about things you have been trusted with. How can we be trustworthy like the workers in these verses?\nA scribe bringing a scroll of scripture to King Josiah; illustration by Robert T. Barrett\n2 Kings 22:8–11\n;\n23:2–3\nThe scriptures teach me to follow Jesus Christ.\nTo introduce the story of King Josiah in\n2 Kings 22–23\n, you could hide a copy of the scriptures somewhere in the room. Invite your children to find it. Then you could share what happened when one of Josiah’s priests found the scriptures in the temple (see\n2 Kings 22:8–11\n; see also “\nKing Josiah\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 148–49). What might happen to us if we didn’t have the scriptures? Share with each other why you are glad we have the scriptures today.\n1:36\nKing Josiah\nAfter reading\n2 Kings 23:2–3\n, you and your children could talk about scriptures that have inspired you to “walk after the Lord” (\nverse 3\n). You could also sing a song about the scriptures, such as “\nSearch, Ponder, and Pray\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 109).\n2 Kings 23:1–3\nI will keep my covenants with God.\nWhen Josiah and his people learned the commandments of God, they made a covenant to live them. Read about this with your children in\n2 Kings 23:1–3\n, and help them find words or phrases that show how the people felt about the Lord’s commandments. Maybe your children could stand and talk about what it might mean to “[stand] to the covenant.” Then they could walk in place and talk about what it might mean to “walk after the Lord.” Next, they could place their hands on their hearts and suggest ways we can keep our covenants “with all [our] heart.”\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "The Kingdom of Judah was surrounded. Armies from three powerful enemy nations were all advancing at once, prepared for battle. In this desperate moment of need, Jehoshaphat, King of Judah, turned to the King of heaven and earth. Jehoshaphat gathered his people at the temple and prayed. He acknowledged their human weakness and pleaded for deliverance. In response, the Lord promised His protection: “Fear not, nor be dismayed” (\n2 Chronicles 20:17\n).\nWe might not have an invading army at our doorstep threatening to destroy us, but sometimes we do feel surrounded by adversity and evil. Our path to deliverance is the same one Jehoshaphat sought, and our prayer can be like his too: “O our God, … we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee” (\n2 Chronicles 20:12\n).\nIn\n2 Chronicles 14–30\n, you will read about Jehoshaphat and other kings in Judah. Consider how their faith-driven reforms, victories, and challenges can apply to your own life.\nFor an overview of the book of 2 Chronicles, see “\nChronicles\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Chronicles 14–16\nTrusting in God will bring me peace.\nWhen Asa was the king of Judah, he faced many challenges—just like we all do today.

Look for evidence of that pressure in\n2 Chronicles 18:1–12\n. What evidence do you find of Micaiah’s courage and integrity in\nverses 13–27\n? (Note that in\nverse 14\n, Micaiah gives a sarcastic response; his real answer is in\nverse 16\n.) How are Micaiah’s words fulfilled in\nverses 28–34\n?\nWhat are some situations in which you might face pressure like Micaiah faced? What gives you courage to stand up for the Lord and His teachings?\nIn the days of King Jehoshaphat, three nations attacked Jerusalem.\n2 Chronicles 20:1–25\nIn difficult times, I can turn to God and His prophets.\nAs you read\n2 Chronicles 20:1–12\n, look for what King Jehoshaphat did when multiple nations came to attack Judah. How could you apply his actions in the challenging circumstances you face?\nThe Lord’s response to Jehoshaphat’s prayer is found in\nverses 14–17\n. What phrases do you find there that could comfort you or someone you know during difficult times?\nThe following day, the people of Jerusalem went out to meet the opposing army. As you read\n2 Chronicles 20:20\n, look for the message Jehoshaphat gave to the people of Jerusalem. How were his words fulfilled? (see\nverses 22–23\n). How has God blessed you for believing in Him and following His prophets?\nPresident Russell M. Nelson said: “My experience is that once you stop putting question marks behind the prophet’s statements and put exclamation points instead, and\ndo it\n, the blessings just pour. I never ask myself, ‘When does the prophet speak as a prophet and when does he not?’ My interest has been, ‘How can I be more like him?’” (in Lane Johnson, “\nRussell M. Nelson: A Study in Obedience\n,”\nEnsign\n, Aug. 1982, 24).\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 21:4–6\n; “A Secure Anchor” (video), Gospel Library; “\nMake inspired choices\n,”\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n(2022), 4–5.\n3:37\nA Secure Anchor\nIdentify simple statements of truth.\nElder Neal A. Maxwell taught: “The scriptures offer us so many doctrinal diamonds. And when the light of the Spirit plays upon their several facets, they sparkle with celestial sense and illuminate the path we are to follow” (“\nAccording to the Desire of [Our] Hearts\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 1996, 21). As you study the scriptures, consider taking time to identify, mark, and ponder short yet powerful messages. Some examples can be found in\n2 Chronicles 14:11\n;\n15:7\n;\n18:13\n;\n20:15\n;\n26:5\n. What other “doctrinal diamonds” can you find?\n2 Chronicles 26:3–21\nPride leads to destruction.\nAs with many other kings of Judah, Uzziah’s reign began with great accomplishments but ended with tragedy. Look for this pattern in\n2 Chronicles 26\n. What would you say was the turning point in Uzziah’s life?\nAs you read\nverses 16–23\n, keep in mind that at this time, only priests were allowed to burn incense in the temple. Why do you think King Uzziah disobeyed God? What do you learn from this tragic experience?\nSee also “\nBe Thou Humble\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 130.\n2 Chronicles 30\nI can be a peacemaker.\nIn\n2 Chronicles 30\n, Hezekiah was the king of Judah. He invited the rival Kingdom of Israel to gather in Jerusalem to celebrate Passover—something the Israelites hadn’t been able to do for many years (see\nverses 1–12\n). What impresses you about the invitation and how it was received—both by the Israelite guests and by their hosts in Judah?\nBecause it had been so long, some visitors to Jerusalem were not familiar with the details of how to participate in Passover. As you read\n2 Chronicles 30:18–27\n, what do you learn from Hezekiah’s response and the results of his response?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nPeacemakers Needed\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 98–101.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n2 Chronicles 14–16\n;\n20\nI can trust God.\nTo introduce the idea of trusting the Lord, you might show your children something you trust to keep you dry when it rains, like an umbrella or jacket. Let them talk about why we can trust these things. Then help them compare that to our trust in the Lord. Why do we trust Him to keep us safe spiritually?\nYou could help your children discover how King Asa and King Jehoshaphat responded to challenges by trusting in the Lord (see\n2 Chronicles 14:11\n;\n20:3–5, 12\n). Share with each other ways you can show the Lord that you trust Him.\n2 Chronicles 20:1–29\nGod will hear and answer my prayers.\nThis week’s activity page can help your children understand the story of Jehoshaphat’s prayer and the Lord’s answer. You and your children could share times when God heard and answered your prayers. Consider including times when the answers came in ways or at times that you didn’t expect. A song about prayer, such as “\nI Pray in Faith\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 14), could help build your children’s faith.\n2 Chronicles 26:3–23\nI can be humble.\nTo learn about the dangers of pride, your children could build a tower with blocks or small cups. As they place each block or cup on the tower, help them identify one of Uzziah’s accomplishments from\n2 Chronicles 26:3–15\n. After they finish the tower, discuss with your children how Uzziah could keep it tall and strong. What could make it fall? Then, as you read\nverse 16\n, you could talk about what it means to have our hearts “lifted up to [our] destruction.” Share with your children what happened to Uzziah in\nverses 16–23\n. Let them knock down their tower. Talk about what we can do to stay humble.\nKing Hezekiah and the People Thank God\n, © Lifeway Collection/licensed from goodsalt.com\n2 Chronicles 30\nI can be a peacemaker.\nThe picture above shows when Hezekiah invited Judah’s neighbors from the Kingdom of Israel to celebrate Passover with them. You could look at this image with your children and read\n2 Chronicles 30:18–19\n, which explains that some of the guests had not washed themselves according to the law of Moses.

But God had not forgotten them. In fact, He had declared through His prophet, “I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return” (\nJeremiah 29:10\n). True to this prophecy, the Lord made a way for His people to return—both to Jerusalem and, more importantly, to their covenants. And He raised up servants who accomplished “a great work” (\nNehemiah 6:3\n): A governor named Zerubbabel oversaw the rebuilding of the house of the Lord. Ezra, a priest and scribe, helped the people turn their hearts back to the Lord’s law. And Nehemiah led the rebuilding of the protective walls around Jerusalem. They met opposition, but they also got help from unexpected sources. Their experiences can inform and inspire ours because we too are doing a great work. And like theirs, our work has much to do with the house of the Lord, the law of the Lord, and the spiritual protection we find in Him.\nFor an overview of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, see “\nEzra\n” and “\nNehemiah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nEzra 1\nThe Lord inspires people to accomplish His purposes.\nAfter Persia conquered Babylonia, the Lord inspired the Persian king, Cyrus, to send a group of Jews to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.

How do you think you might have felt if you had been one of the Jews who witnessed this? (see\nPsalm 137\n). Notice how the Jews felt, decades later, when they were allowed to return and rebuild the temple (see\nEzra 3:8–13\n;\n6:16–22\n). That might prompt you to ponder your own feelings about the Lord and His house. Why is the building of a temple a reason to celebrate?\nThe temple of Zerubbabel; illustration by Sam Lawlor\nEzra 4–7\n;\nNehemiah 2\n;\n4\n;\n6\nGod has an important work for me to do.\nThe Lord’s work rarely goes unopposed. This was true of the efforts led by Zerubbabel and Nehemiah. Here’s a simple approach that can help you learn from these stories and consider how you can do the Lord’s work despite opposition:\nGod’s work for Zerubbabel (\nEzra 4:3\n):\nCreate a Note\nGod’s work for Nehemiah (\nNehemiah 2:17–18\n):\nCreate a Note\nGod’s work for me:\nCreate a Note\nOpposition Zerubbabel faced (\nEzra 4:4–24\n):\nCreate a Note\nOpposition Nehemiah faced (\nNehemiah 2:19\n;\n4:1–3, 7–8\n;\n6:1–13\n):\nCreate a Note\nOpposition I face:\nCreate a Note\nHow Zerubbabel responded (\nEzra 5:1–2\n):\nCreate a Note\nHow Nehemiah responded (\nNehemiah 2:20\n;\n4:6, 9\n;\n6:3–15\n):\nCreate a Note\nHow I can respond:\nCreate a Note\nFor help comparing Nehemiah’s experience to your life, you might study President Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “\nWe Are Doing a Great Work and Cannot Come Down\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2009, 59–62), especially\nthe last two sections\n. As you think about the work God has given you, you might study the “\nYoung Women Theme\n” or the “\nAaronic Priesthood Quorum Theme\n” (Gospel Library). Or you could look in a hymn like “\nAs Sisters in Zion\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 309) or “\nYe Elders of Israel\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 319).\nWhat do you think it means to have “a mind to work” in the service of the Savior? (\nNehemiah 4:6\n). What might it mean to have “the good hand of … God upon [you]” as you do His work? (\nNehemiah 2:8\n; see also\nNehemiah 2:18\n;\nEzra 7:6, 9, 27–28\n). How have you seen His hand in your efforts to serve Him?\nNehemiah 8\nI am blessed when I study the scriptures.\nFor generations in captivity, the Jews had limited access to “the book of the law of Moses” (\nNehemiah 8:1\n). In\nNehemiah 8\n, Ezra read the law to the people. What do you find in this chapter that shows how Ezra and his people felt about God and His word? (see especially\nverses 1–12\n). What in your life shows how you feel about God and His word?\nSee also\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson\n(2014),\n115–24\n.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nEzra 3:8–13\n;\n6:16–22\nThe house of the Lord is a place of joy.\nTo teach your children about the joy the Jews felt when their temple was rebuilt, you could show them a picture like the one below. Talk about why these people might be happy to be at the house of the Lord. You could also tell your children why the temple is a place of joy for you. How has the temple helped you feel closer to Heavenly Father and the Savior?\nAs you read\nEzra 3:10–13\nwith your children, help them find words that show how the Jews felt when the temple was being rebuilt. When you get to the end of\nverse 13\n, maybe you could shout for joy together. Help your children think of reasons to be joyful that the Lord has given us temples. How can we show that joy?\nConsider singing a song about the temple with your children, such as the second verse of “Welcome Home” (Gospel Library). After each line, you could pause to ask a child to share something he or she loves about the temple. You might also look at\npictures of temples\nwhile you sing.\nNehemiah 2:17–20\n;\n6:1–9\nThe Lord will help me do His “great work.”\nShare with your children the story of Nehemiah (see\nNehemiah 2:17–20\n;\n6:1–9\n; or “\nNehemiah\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 173–74). As you read\nNehemiah 2:20\n, you and your children could “arise” and pretend to help build the walls of Jerusalem. Or your children might enjoy building a wall with blocks or other objects. As they do, you could help them think of important things Heavenly Father wants us to do.\n1:38\nNehemiah\nAs you read\nNehemiah 6:9\n, invite your children to raise their hands when they hear you say “strengthen my hands.” Tell the children about a time when you felt God strengthen your hands to do His work.\nNehemiah 8:1–12\nThe scriptures are a blessing.\nRead aloud some phrases from\nNehemiah 8:2–3, 5–6, 8–9, 12\nthat describe what the people did when they heard Ezra read the scriptures. As you read, your children could act out these phrases. Then you could share with each other how you feel when you read or hear the scriptures.\nAs you read together\nNehemiah 8:8\n, you could ask your children what helps them understand the scriptures. Show them how to use scripture study aids like the\nGuide to the Scriptures\nand\nTopics and Questions\n(Gospel Library). Invite your children to share something they have learned about the Savior from the scriptures.\nLook for eternal truth in the scriptures.\n“The scriptures … are filled with gospel truths, but sometimes it takes conscious effort to find them. As you are learning together from the scriptures, stop and ask those you teach what gospel truths they notice. Help them see how these truths relate to Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. Sometimes eternal truths are stated in the scriptures, and sometimes they are illustrated in the stories and lives of the people we read about. It can also be helpful to explore together the historical background of the verses you are reading, as well as the meaning of the verses and how they apply to us today” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n22\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "title": "Esther",
        "content": "Many events in the book of Esther might seem like luck or coincidence. How else do you explain how an orphaned Jewish girl became the queen of Persia at just the right time to save her people from slaughter? What are the chances that Esther’s cousin Mordecai would happen to overhear a plot to assassinate the king? Were these coincidences, or were they part of a divine plan? Elder Ronald A. Rasband noted: “What may appear to be a random chance is, in fact, overseen by a loving Father in Heaven. … The Lord is in the small details of our lives” (“\nBy Divine Design\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 56). We might not always recognize the Lord’s influence in these “small details.” But we learn from Esther’s experience that He can guide our path and prepare us “for such a time” (\nEsther 4:14\n) when we can be instruments in His hands to fulfill His purposes.\nFor an overview of the book of Esther, see “\nEsther, book of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nEsther\nThe Lord puts me in situations where I can bless others.\nPresident Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught that each of us “stands at a unique place and has an important task that only [we] can perform. … The Lord gave you your responsibilities for a reason. There may be people and hearts only you can reach and touch. Perhaps no one else could do it in quite the same way” (“\nLift Where You Stand\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2008, 56).\nAs you read the story of Esther, ponder how this statement applies to her. Look for ways the Lord made it possible for her to save the Jews (see, for example,\nEsther 2:21–23\n;\n3:10–14\n;\n4:14–16\n). Then ponder how He has given you opportunities to bless others. What are some circumstances or relationships that He has guided you to “for such a time as this”? (\nEsther 4:14\n). If you have a patriarchal blessing, consider reading it to learn more about the work the Lord has for you to do. What can you do to accomplish this work?\nSee also “For Such a Time as This” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\n13:44\nFor Such a Time as This\nWe learn more by doing than by listening.\nElder David A. Bednar counseled teachers: “Our intent ought not to be ‘What do I tell them?’ Instead, the questions to ask ourselves are ‘What can I invite them to do? What inspired questions can I ask that, if they are willing to respond, will begin to invite the Holy Ghost into their lives?’” (in\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n25\n). If you are teaching your family or a class about Esther, what could you ask them to do that will help them learn?\n“When Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not … then was Haman full of wrath” (\nEsther 3:5\n).\nEsther 3\n;\n5:9–14\n;\n7\nPride and anger can lead to downfall.\nIn the book of Esther, we learn from the faithfulness of Esther and Mordecai, but we also learn from the pride and anger of Haman. As you read\nEsther 3\n;\n5:9–14\n, note Haman’s feelings, words, and actions. What do they reveal about him and his motivations? What consequences did he face? (see\nEsther 7\n). Reading about Haman may prompt you to evaluate what motivates your feelings and actions. Are you inspired to make any changes? How can you turn to Heavenly Father for help?\nSee also\nProverbs 16:32\n;\nAlma 5:28\n.\nEsther 3–4\n;\n5:2–3\n;\n8:11–12\nFasting shows that I trust and rely on the Lord.\nNotice why Esther and the rest of the Jews decided to fast (see\nEsther 3:13\n;\n4:1–3, 10–17\n). How did fasting bless them? (see\nEsther 5:2–3\n;\n8:11–12\n). Why does the Lord ask us to fast? (see Topics and Questions, “\nFasting and Fast Offerings\n,” Gospel Library). Consider how you can make fasting a greater blessing in your life.\nSee also\nIsaiah 58:6–12\n; “Fasting: Young Single Adult Ward, Amanda” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\n2:41\nFasting: Young Single Adult Ward, Amanda\nEsther 3:1–11\n;\n4:10–17\n;\n5:1–4\n;\n9:17–19\nDoing the right thing often requires great courage.\nWhen Mordecai and Esther stood up for their beliefs and their people, they put their lives at risk. Our choices might have less severe consequences, but doing the right thing can still require courage. What do you learn from\nEsther 3:1–4\n;\n4:10–17\nabout having courage to do the right thing? Note the different consequences Mordecai and Esther experienced after showing courage (see\nEsther 3:5–11\n;\n5:1–4\n). What did Esther and Mordecai need to know about God to make the choices they made?\nThink of situations where you need courage to stand up for what’s right. What do you learn from Esther and Mordecai that can help you find courage in the Lord?\nEsther’s courage led to “a day of gladness” (see\nEsther 9:17–19\n). How has Christlike courage given you “a day of gladness”?\nSee also “Courage,” “Dare to Stand Alone” (videos), Gospel Library; “\nTrue to the Faith\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 254.\n3:19\nCourage\n4:20\nDare to Stand Alone\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nEsther 2:5–7\nI can serve my family.\nYou might feel inspired to use\nEsther 2:7\nto teach your children about helping family members in need, as Mordecai did for Esther. You could read the verse together or summarize it in your own words. Then you and your children could think of family members who might need your help. Make a plan to help them.\nEsther 3:1–11\n;\n4:10–17\nThe Lord can help me be brave.\nThe examples of Esther and Mordecai can help your children understand that bravery means doing what is right even when you are afraid. Consider writing the phrases\nMordecai was brave when he …\nand\nEsther was brave when she …\n. As you learn the story of Esther together, your children could suggest ways to finish the sentences. You could read\nEsther 3:1–11\n;\n4:10–17\nor “\nQueen Esther\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 166–70) or look at the pictures in this outline. Then write\nI will be brave by …\n, and invite your children to list things Heavenly Father wants them to do that require courage. A song about courage, such as “\nDare to Do Right\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 158), could help.\n2:45\nQueen Esther\nYou could also learn about times when Jesus Christ was brave—for example, when He suffered for our sins in Gethsemane and on the cross (see\nMatthew 26:36–39\n;\n27:33–35\n). Ask your children to share a time when they were brave, and share your own experiences as well.\nEsther 4:1–3, 10–17\nFasting brings the Lord’s blessings.\nReading\nEsther 4:1–3, 10–17\ncould help you teach your children about fasting. Why did Esther and the Jews fast? Tell your children why you fast. You could also ask them how they would explain fasting to a friend who has never done it before. How could we help our friends understand the blessings that come from fasting?\nEncourage your children to think of something they might need the Lord’s help with. Suggest they make that part of their fast during the next fast Sunday.\nBecause Esther was brave, she was able to save the Lord’s people.\nEsther 4:14\nI can be an instrument in God’s hands.\nHelp your children understand that when Esther was afraid, Mordecai encouraged her by explaining that the Lord had helped her become the queen “for such a time as this” (\nEsther 4:14\n). What did Mordecai mean by this? Talk with each other about how Esther was an instrument for the Lord. How can we be instruments for the Lord?\nHow could you help your children understand what an instrument is? Maybe you could invite someone to play a song on a musical instrument or show a picture of someone using a tool. You could then talk about what it means to be an instrument in God’s hands.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "It’s natural to wonder why bad things happen to good people—or, for that matter, why good things happen to bad people. Why would God, who is just, allow that? The book of Job explores questions like these. Job was one of those good people to whom a lot of bad things happened. Because of Job’s trials, his friends wondered if he really was good after all. Job asserted his own righteousness and wondered if God really is just after all. But despite his suffering and wondering, Job maintained his integrity and faith in Jesus Christ. In the book of Job, faith is questioned and tested but never completely abandoned. That doesn’t mean all the questions are answered. But the book of Job teaches that until they are answered, questions can coexist with faith. And regardless of what happens in the meantime, we can say of our Lord, “Yet will I trust in him” (\nJob 13:15\n).\nFor an overview of the book of Job, see “\nJob\n” in the Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJob 1–3\n;\n12–13\nI can trust God in all circumstances.\nThe opening chapters of Job emphasize, in a poetic way, Satan’s role as our adversary or accuser; they don’t describe an actual interaction between God and Satan. As you read what Satan said about Job (see\nJob 1:9–11\n;\n2:4–5\n), you might ask yourself, “Why do I remain faithful to God?” Why would it be dangerous to obey the Lord solely for the reason Satan suggested?\nWhat impresses you about Job’s responses to his trials? (see\nJob 1:20–22\n;\n2:9–10\n).\nJob’s friends suggested that God was punishing him (see\nJob 4–5\n;\n8\n;\n11\n). What problems do you see with this idea? Read Job’s response in\nchapters 12–13\n. What did Job know about God that enabled him to keep trusting? What do you know about God that helps you face challenges?\nJob 19\nJesus Christ is my Redeemer.\nSometimes we learn the most important truths during our most difficult times. Ponder the trials Job described in\nJob 19:1–22\nand the truths he proclaimed in\nverses 23–27\n. How do you know that your Redeemer lives? What difference does this knowledge make in your life?\nConsider singing or listening to a hymn about Jesus Christ, such as “\nI Know That My Redeemer Lives\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 136). What words from this hymn express your feelings about Him?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:1–12\n;\n122\n.\nJob 21–24\n“When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.”\nIn\nJob 21–24\n, you’ll read a debate between Job and his friends. At the heart of this debate was a question many people have asked: Why do righteous people sometimes suffer?\nAlthough we don’t have all the answers, in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, we have some truths that can help us make sense of adversity and suffering. Below are latter-day scriptures that contain some of these truths. What do these scriptures teach you about Heavenly Father and His plan?\n2 Nephi 2:11–13\nMosiah 23:21–23\n;\n24:10–16\nEther 12:27\nDoctrine and Covenants 58:3–5\nAbraham 3:22–26\nYou could also read President Spencer W. Kimball’s teachings about adversity in “\nTragedy or Destiny?\n” (\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball\n[2011]), 11–21).\nBased on what you have studied, how might you answer a question like “Why does God allow righteous people to suffer?”\nCalm and Stars\n, by Yongsung Kim. Image courtesy of havenlight.com\nJob 38–40\n;\n42\nGod’s perspective is greater than mine.\nFrustrated with his friends’ accusations (see\nJob 16:1–5\n;\n19:1–3\n), Job repeatedly asked God why he had to suffer so much (see\nJob 19:6–7\n;\n23:1–9\n;\n31\n). The Lord did not give a clear reason in the book of Job. But He did teach an important message in\nchapters 38–40\n. How would you summarize that message? For example, what do you learn from the Lord’s questions in\nJob 38:1–7, 18–24\n?\nYou’ll notice that the Lord spoke to Job about some of His creations and other mighty works (see\nJob 38–39\n). You might look at some of those creations (or pictures of them). How do these things help you think differently about God? about your trials? How did they change Job’s perspective? (see\nJob 42:1–6\n; see also\nMoses 1:8–10\n).\nHere are two general conference messages that can help change our perspective: Tamara W. Runia, “\nSeeing God’s Family through the Overview Lens\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 62–69); Russell M. Nelson, “\nThink Celestial!\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 117–20). In either message, look for something that you’ll want to remember the next time your trials seem overwhelming. How will you remind yourself of what you learned?\nBe creative.\nLearning doesn’t have to consist only of reading, thinking, and talking. Sometimes the most memorable learning comes in physically active ways. For example, when you read about how the Lord changed Job’s perspective in\nJob 38–40\n, you might take a walk and look at some of the Lord’s creations, large and small. Or you might look at an object from different perspectives—from above, below, up close, far away, and so on.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nJob 1–2\n;\n12\n;\n19\nFaith in Jesus Christ will help me during hard times.\nEncourage your children to tell you what they know about Job. If they need help, you could point them to\nJob 1:1, 13–22\n;\n2:7–10\nor to “\nJob\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 145–47). How did Job respond to challenges? (see\nJob 1:21\n;\n2:10\n).\n1:55\nJob\nJob was faithful in his challenges because of what he knew about the Lord. Maybe you and your children could look at pictures of Jesus Christ interacting with others (such as the one below or pictures in the\nGospel Art Book\n). Talk about what you know about Him and what He is like. Here are some verses that show what Job knew about the Lord:\nJob 12:10, 13, 16\n;\n19:25–27\n. Why is it valuable to know these things about Him?\nHe Healed Them All\n, by Michael Malm\nJob 14:14\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I will live again after I die.\nJob asked an important question in\nJob 14:14\n. Maybe you and your children could take turns sharing how you would answer Job. You could look for ideas in\nAlma 11:42–44\n, in the video “In a Coming Day” (Gospel Library), or in a song about the Resurrection, such as “\nDid Jesus Really Live Again?\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 64).\n1:11\n#BECAUSEofHIM: An Easter Message of Hope and Triumph\nJob 16:1–5\n;\n22:5\nGood friends uplift and encourage each other.\nWhen Job was sad, his friends said that God was punishing him because he had sinned (see\nJob 22:5\n). If we were Job’s friends, how would we try to help him? How can our words help others when they are sad? (see\nJob 16:5\n). Consider showing one or more of the pictures in this outline as you discuss these questions.\nConsider asking your children to list some qualities of a good friend and to name a friend who has these qualities. Then you could look at a picture of Jesus Christ. In what ways is Jesus a good friend to each of us? You might think of someone who’s going through a hard time. Plan how you will be a Christlike friend to them.\nJob 19:23–27\nJesus Christ is my Redeemer.\nAfter reading\nJob 19:23–27\n, you and your children could talk about how you know that our Redeemer lives. You might work together to put your testimony (or drawings of the Savior) in a book (see\nverse 23\n).\nYou could also sing a song that testifies of the Savior, such as “\nI Know That My Redeemer Lives\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 136). Share phrases from the hymn that strengthen your faith in Him. Why is it important to know that Jesus Christ lives?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "We don’t know for certain who wrote the Psalms. Some are attributed to King David, but for most of them, the writers remain anonymous. Yet after reading the Psalms, we feel as if we know the hearts of the psalmists, even if we don’t know their names. We do know that the Psalms were an important part of worship among the Israelites, and we know that the Savior quoted them often. In the Psalms, we get a window into the soul of God’s ancient people. We see how they felt about God, what they worried about, and how they found peace. As believers today, all over the world, we still use these words in our worship of God. It’s almost like the writers of the Psalms had a window into\nour\nsouls, because they expressed how we feel about God, what we worry about, and how we find peace.\nFor an overview of the book of Psalms, see “\nPsalms\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nPsalms 1\n;\n23\n;\n26–28\n;\n46\n“I have trusted … in the Lord.”\nAs you read the Psalms, you might notice how often the writers express fear, sorrow, or anxiety. Such feelings are normal, even for people of faith. But what makes the Psalms inspiring is that they also offer inspiring solutions, including complete trust in the Lord. As you read\nPsalms 1\n;\n23\n;\n26–28\n;\n46\n, write down:\nInvitations to trust the Lord.\nWords that describe Him.\nWords that describe the peace, strength, and other blessings He provides.\nWords that describe people who trust Him.\nAlso watch for the vivid imagery and symbols that the Psalms use to teach about the Savior. For example, in\nPsalm 23\n, what do phrases like “lie down in green pastures” or “still waters” (\nverse 2\n) bring to mind? What could the comforting “rod” and “staff” (\nverse 4\n) symbolize? What might it mean for our “cup” (\nverse 5\n) to run over?\nPsalms 2\n;\n22\nJesus Christ is the promised Messiah.\nSeveral of the psalms point to the mortal life of Jesus Christ. Christians in New Testament times saw these connections too. Consider reading the following scripture references. Look for connections between the words in these psalms and the life of the Savior:\nPsalm 2:1–3\nand\nActs 4:24–28\nPsalm 2:7\nand\nActs 13:30–33\nPsalm 22:1\nand\nMatthew 27:45–46\nPsalm 22:7–8\nand\nMatthew 27:39–43\nPsalm 22:16\nand\nLuke 23:32–33\nPsalm 22:18\nand\nMatthew 27:35\nPsalm 31:5\nand\nLuke 23:46\nWhat do you learn from studying these connections? What scriptural prophecies and promises haven’t been fulfilled yet? What do you find in these promises that gives you hope for the future?\nPsalms 8\n;\n19\n;\n33\n“The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.”\nReading\nPsalms 8\n;\n19\n;\n33\nmight inspire you to consider the Lord’s many wonderful creations. Pay attention to your feelings as you do. You might also want to sing or ponder the words of a song related to these psalms, such as “\nHow Great Thou Art\n” (\nHymns\n, 86). How do the Lord’s creations “declare the glory of God” to you? (\nPsalm 19:1\n).\nHere are some other hymns inspired by the Psalms:\nPsalm 23\n:\n“\nThe Lord Is My Shepherd\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 108)\nPsalms 23:6\n;\n150\n:\n“\nPraise to the Lord, the Almighty\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 72)\nPsalm 26:8\n:\n“\nWe Love Thy House, O God\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 247)\nPsalm 27:1\n:\n“\nThe Lord Is My Light\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 89)\nPsalms 33:1–6\n;\n95:1–6\n:\n“\nFor the Beauty of the Earth\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 92)\nPsalm 37:3–9\n:\n“\nBe Still, My Soul\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 124)\nPsalm 148\n:\n“\nAll Creatures of Our God and King\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 62)\nUse music.\nPresident Dallin H. Oaks said: “The singing of hymns is one of the best ways to put ourselves in tune with the Spirit of the Lord. … Sacred music has a unique capacity to communicate our feelings of love for the Lord. This kind of communication is a wonderful aid to our worship. … Our hymns contain matchless doctrinal sermons, surpassed only by the scriptures in their truth and poetic impact” (“\nWorship through Music\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 1994, 10, 11). What hymns related to the Psalms could you listen to or sing to enhance your worship this week?\nPsalms 19:7–11\n;\n29\nThe word of the Lord is powerful, “rejoicing the heart.”\nIn the Psalms, words like\ntestimony\n,\nstatutes\n,\ncommandment\n, and\njudgments\ncan refer to the word of the Lord. Keep that in mind as you read\nPsalm 19:7–11\n. What do these verses suggest to you about the word of the Lord? What does\nPsalm 29\nteach you about His voice? In your experience, how has the word or voice of the Lord matched these descriptions?\nPsalms 24\n;\n26–27\nThe Savior can help me be pure so I can enter God’s presence.\nBecause the temple at Jerusalem was built on a hill, the phrase “hill of the Lord” (\nPsalm 24:3\n) could refer to the temple or to the presence of God. What does this add to your understanding of\nPsalm 24\n? What does it mean to you to have “clean hands, and a pure heart”? (\nverse 4\n). As you read\nPsalms 26–27\n, what else do you learn about the house of the Lord?\nAt times, we might be discouraged to hear that we need to be pure to enter the presence of God. After all, we all struggle, and none of us are perfect. What hope do you find in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “\nClean Hands and a Pure Heart\n”? (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2007, 80–83). How could you use his message to help someone who feels overwhelmed with wanting to be perfect? Consider how you can receive the Savior’s help in your efforts to have “clean hands, and a pure heart.”\nSee also Bradley R. Wilcox, “\nWorthiness Is Not Flawlessness\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 61–67.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nPsalms 23\n;\n27–28\n;\n32\n;\n46\nThe Lord offers me peace, strength, and guidance.\nConsider writing\nThe Lord is …\nInvite your children to look for ways to complete that sentence using scriptures like these:\nPsalms 23:1\n;\n27:1\n;\n28:1\n;\n28:7\n;\n32:7\n;\n46:1\n. What do these verses teach us about how the Lord can help us?\nYou could discuss with your children what a lamb needs to be safe and healthy. Then, as you read together\nPsalm 23\n, help your children compare what a shepherd does for a lamb with what Jesus does for us. What do we need to be spiritually safe and healthy? Sing together a song that could give them ideas, such as “\nI Feel My Savior’s Love\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 74–75).\nConcepción Chile Temple\nPsalm 24:3–4\nTo enter the temple, we need “clean hands, and a pure heart.”\nAs you read\nPsalm 24:3\ntogether, your children could look for words that remind them of the temple. They could also look at a picture of a temple. Then you could read together\nverse 4\nto learn who can enter the temple. You could talk about how hands get dirty and how we clean them. How do we get spiritually dirty? How does the Savior help clean us spiritually?\nPsalm 30:5\nJesus Christ can turn sadness into joy.\nIf you have young children, you could invite them to pretend to cry while you read from\nPsalm 30:5\n, “Weeping may endure for a night.” Then ask them to express joy as you read, “But joy cometh in the morning.” Repeat this phrase a few times.\nShow a picture of the Savior, and tell your children what He has done for you that brings you joy. You could also give each child a turn to hold the picture and share what Jesus has done that brings them joy.\nPsalm 46:10\n“Be still, and know that I am God.”\nHelp your children memorize the first line from\nPsalm 46:10\n: “Be still, and know that I am God.” What could it mean to “be still”? Maybe you could spend some time practicing being still. You could also share with each other experiences when being “still” strengthened your relationship with God. Help your children think of times during the day when they can “be still” to feel close to Heavenly Father.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "The writers of the Psalms shared deeply personal feelings in their poetry. They wrote about feeling discouraged, afraid, and remorseful. At times, they even felt abandoned by God, and some psalms carry a tone of frustration or desperation. If you’ve ever felt that way, reading the Psalms can help you know that you aren’t the only one. But you’ll also find psalms that can encourage you when you’re having such feelings, because the psalmists also praised the Lord for His goodness, marveled at His power, and rejoiced in His mercy. They knew that we are burdened by evil and sin but that the Lord is “good, and ready to forgive” (\nPsalm 86:5\n). They understood that having faith in the Lord doesn’t mean that you’ll never struggle with anxiety, sin, or fear. It means that you know who to turn to when you do.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nPsalms 49\n;\n62:5–12\nRedemption comes only through Jesus Christ.\nPsalm 49\nhas a message for “both low and high, rich and poor” (\nverse 2\n). What would you say this message is? What do you feel\nPsalm 62:5–12\nadds to that message?\nReading these psalms might inspire you to ponder the ways we are tempted to trust something other than God for redemption (see\nPsalm 49:6–7\n). How is your life influenced by your testimony that “God will redeem [your] soul from the power of the grave”? (\nPsalm 49:15\n).\nPsalms 51\n;\n85–86\nBecause of the Savior’s mercy, I can be forgiven.\nKing David wrote\nPsalm 51\nafter he recognized his desperate need for forgiveness—something we all need. Which verses describe feelings you’ve had? What do you find in this psalm that gives you hope for forgiveness?\nYou might also search\nPsalm 51\nfor clues about what it means to repent. Make a list of what you find. See if you can add to your list by searching President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nWe Can Do Better and Be Better\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 67–69).\nHow would you describe what it feels like to receive forgiveness through Christ? If you need help describing your feelings, you could look in\nPsalms 51:1–2, 7–12\n;\n85:2–9\n. Some people like to draw or find pictures to express their feelings; you might try that. You could also sing or listen to a hymn about the Savior, such as “\nI Stand All Amazed\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 193).\nTo repent, we need faith not only that Jesus Christ\ncan\ncleanse us but also that He\nwill\n. What do you find in\nPsalm 86:5, 13, 15\nthat helps you know the Savior is both able and willing to forgive?\nSee also\nAlma 36\n; Peter F. Meurs, “\nHe Could Heal\nMe\n!,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 39–41.\nPsalms 51:13–15\n;\n66:5–20\n;\n71:15–24\nMy testimony of Jesus Christ can help others come unto Him.\nPonder how you gained your testimony of Jesus Christ and His atoning power. Then, as you study\nPsalms 51:13–15\n;\n66:5–20\n;\n71:15–24\n, think about how you can invite others to “come and see the works of God” (\nPsalm 66:5\n). If you were to “declare what [the Lord] hath done for [your] soul” (\nPsalm 66:16\n), what would you declare?\nWhat does it mean to you to “talk of [His] righteousness all the day long”? (\nPsalm 71:24\n).\nSee also\nAlma 26\n.\n“Come and hear, … and I will declare what [God] hath done for my soul” (\nPsalm 66:16\n).\nPsalms 63\n;\n69\n;\n77–78\nThe Lord will help me in my time of need.\nSeveral psalms describe what it’s like to feel distant from God and desperately need His help (see\nPsalms 63:1, 8\n;\n69:1–8, 18–21\n;\n77:1–9\n). In\nPsalms 63\n;\n69\n;\n77–78\n, what do you find that gave the psalmists reassurance?\nWhen you are distressed, how does it help you to “remember the works of the Lord” and His “wonders of old”? (\nPsalm 77:11\n). Some of those wonders are described in\nPsalm 78\n. As you read about them, ponder what helps you “set [your] hope in God” (\nverse 7\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “Appendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path.”\nPsalms 51\n;\n86:5, 13, 15\nWhen I make a wrong choice, Jesus can help me change.\nTo help your children discover truths about repentance in\nPsalm 51\n, you could draw a large heart. Then you could help your children write inside the heart bad things Satan tempts us to do. How do we get these things out of our hearts? Ask your children to find the word “heart” in\nPsalm 51:10, 17\n. Talk about what these verses teach about repentance. Let your children erase the words inside the heart and write new words that describe the ways Jesus can change us when we repent.\nYou might want to help your children learn what it means to have “a broken and a contrite heart” (\nPsalm 51:17\n). They could take turns breaking open something that has a hard shell, such as an egg or a nut. You could help them compare the shell to things that keep us from feeling Heavenly Father’s love. How can we open our heart to Him?\nYou could also look at a picture of the Savior together and ask your children what words they would use to describe Him. Invite them to find words that describe Him in\nPsalm 86:5, 13, 15\n. Why is it important to know these things about Him?\nPsalm 61:2–3\nJesus Christ is my rock.\nYour children might enjoy drawing pictures of the symbols in\nPsalm 61:2–3\n. How is Jesus Christ like a high “rock” (\nverse 2\n), “a shelter,” and “a strong tower”? (\nverse 3\n).\n“Thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower” (\nPsalm 61:3\n).\nPsalms 66:16\n;\n77:11\n;\n78:6–7\n“I will remember the works of the Lord.”\nAsk your children to share some of their favorite scripture stories (pictures from the\nGospel Art Book\nmight help). What do these stories teach us about the Lord? You could read together\nPsalm 66:16\nand take turns answering the question “What has the Lord done for my soul”?\nAs you read\nPsalms 77:11\n;\n78:6–7\ntogether, you could share with each other how you try to “remember the works of the Lord” (\nPsalm 77:11\n), including His works in your life. How does the sacrament help us “always remember”? (\nMoroni 4:3\n;\n5:2\n).\nPsalm 71:8\nI can tell others about Jesus Christ.\nAfter reading\nPsalm 71:8\nwith your children, invite them to draw a large mouth. Ask them to help you “fill” the mouth with pictures or words representing things we can tell others about Jesus Christ.\nYou could pass around a picture of Jesus Christ. The person holding the picture could say one thing they know about Him. How can we help other people know these things?\nChildren have much to share.\n“When children learn something new, they naturally want to share it with others. Encourage this desire by giving children opportunities to teach gospel principles to each other, their family members, and their friends. Also ask them to share with you their thoughts, feelings, and experiences related to the principles you are teaching. You will find that they have insights that are simple, pure, and powerful” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n32\n).\nPsalm 86:7\nHeavenly Father hears and answers my prayers.\nMany of the psalms are like prayers to God. As you read Psalms with your children, you might show them things we can use to communicate with people who are far away, such as a phone or a letter. Then read\nPsalm 86:7\n. How do we “call upon” Heavenly Father? How does He answer us?\nYou could sing together a song about prayer, such as “\nA Child’s Prayer\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 12–13; see also Susan H. Porter, “\nPray, He Is There\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 77–79). Tell each other about times when God answered your prayers.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "The traditional Jewish name for the book of Psalms is\nTehillim\n, a Hebrew word that means “praises.” It’s related to the exclamation\nhallelujah\n(meaning “praise Jehovah” or “praise the Lord”). If you had to choose one word to sum up the main message of the Psalms,\npraise\nwould be a good choice. Some psalms contain the direct invitation to “praise ye the Lord” (see especially\nPsalms 146–50\n), and all of them can inspire worship and praise. The Psalms invite us to acknowledge the Lord’s power, His mercy, and the great things He has done. We can never repay Him for any of this, but we can praise Him. That praise might take different forms for different people—it might involve singing, praying, or bearing testimony. It often leads to a deeper commitment to the Lord and to following His teachings. Whatever “praise ye the Lord” means in your life, you can find inspiration to do it as you read and ponder the Psalms.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nPsalms 102–3\n;\n116\nThe Lord can comfort me in my suffering.\nNote how\nPsalm 102:1–11\ndescribes feelings of anxiety and isolation that often come during challenges. Maybe you or others you know have experienced such feelings. As you read\nPsalms 102:12–28\n;\n103\n;\n116\n, look for phrases that give you confidence to “call upon the name of the Lord” in your trials (\nPsalm 116:13\n). You might want to mark, memorize, or share with others phrases that give you hope in Him.\nSee also\nIsaiah 25:8\n;\nHebrews 2:17–18\n;\nAlma 7:11–13\n; Camille N.

Here are a few examples:\nPsalm 110:1–4\n(see\nMatthew 22:41–45\n;\nHebrews 5:4–10\n;\n6:20\n)\nPsalm 118:22\n(see\nMatthew 21:42\n;\nActs 4:10–11\n;\n1 Peter 2:7\n)\nPsalm 118:25–26\n(see\nMatthew 21:9\n)\nWhat do these verses teach you about Jesus Christ? Why is it important to know this about Him?\nPsalm 119\nGod’s word will keep me on His path.\nPsalm 119\ncontains many phrases that compare our lives to a journey back to Heavenly Father. As you read, look for words like “walk,” “path,” “way,” “feet,” and “wander.” Ponder your own life’s journey—where you have been, where you are now, and where you are heading. What do you learn from this psalm about your journey back home? What have you learned by watching the paths of others? According to this psalm, what has God provided to help you stay on His path?\nThink about a time when following a path or a map helped you travel somewhere successfully. What does that experience teach you about following God’s path?\nIn many other scriptures, the Lord and His prophets speak of a path. Below are some examples. Consider searching these verses and writing down or sharing with others what you learn.\nScripture\nWhat I learn about the path to God\nScripture\nProverbs 4:11–19\nScripture\nMatthew 7:13–14\nScripture\n1 Nephi 8:20–28\nScripture\n2 Nephi 31:17–21\nScripture\nAlma 7:9, 19–20\nScripture\nDoctrine and Covenants 25:2\nHow can these truths help you stay on God’s path?\nWhat additional insights can you learn from the following counsel from President Russell M. Nelson?\n“If our journey through life is to be successful, we need to follow divine direction. The Lord said, ‘Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not’ [\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:36\n]. And the Psalmist wrote, ‘Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path’ [\nPsalm 119:105\n]. …\n“In your journey through life, you meet many obstacles and make some mistakes. Scriptural guidance helps you to recognize error and make the necessary correction. You stop going in the wrong direction. You carefully study the scriptural road map. Then you proceed with repentance and restitution required to get on the ‘strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life’ [\n2 Nephi 31:18\n]” (“\nLiving by Scriptural Guidance\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 2000, 17).\nSee also Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “\nThe Prodigal and the Road That Leads Home\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 86–88.\nPsalms 134–36\nThe Lord is more powerful than any idol.\nNotice why, according to\nPsalm 135:15–18\n, it is foolish to trust in false gods. What might you be tempted to trust in that is similar to an idol? You might make a list of the things the Lord can do, as the psalmists did in\nPsalms 134–36\n. What powerful things has He done for you?\nPsalm 139\nThe Lord knows my heart.\nWhat do you find in\nPsalm 139\nthat helps you understand that the Lord is aware of you—your thoughts and actions, strengths and weaknesses? How does this truth influence your life and your choices?\nPsalms 146–50\n“Praise ye the Lord.”\nAs you read these final psalms of praise, think about reasons you have to praise the Lord. Why is it important to praise Him? What are some ways you can praise Him?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nPsalm 102:1–2\nThe Lord comforts me and gives me hope.\nYou or one of your children could read\nPsalm 102:1–2\n, looking for how the Lord helps us during our difficulties. How can we find His help? You could also share with each other times when you needed help and felt that God heard your prayers.\nPsalm 119:105\nGod’s word is like a light.\nYour children might have fun talking about what it feels like to be in the dark. Or they could discuss things that are hard to do in the dark. You might invite them to do something with their eyes closed, such as draw a picture. What do we learn from\nPsalm 119:105\nabout light and the word of God?\nLook for something Heavenly Father has given us to help us stay on His path in the following verses:\nPsalms 119:47–48\n;\n119:105\n;\n1 Nephi 11:25\n;\n2 Nephi 31:20\n. What can we do to stay on God’s path?\nYour children might enjoy looking at pictures of the things mentioned in\nPsalm 119:105\n. They could place the pictures in order as they read the verse. You could also sing a related song together, such as “\nTeach Me to Walk in the Light\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 177) or “\nI Will Walk with Jesus\n” (Gospel Library).\nPsalm 139:1–3, 23–24\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ know me and love me.\nConsider making short lists of things you know about each of your children. As you read the lists one at a time, ask the children to guess who you are describing. Then, after reading\nPsalm 139:1–3\ntogether, you could list things that Heavenly Father and Jesus know about us.\nWrite the words of\nPsalm 139:23–24\non a piece of paper or a board. Invite your children to underline words that describe things God can do for us. Why would we want God to do these things?\nPsalm 146:1, 5–9\nI can praise the Lord.\nMaybe your children could share experiences when someone praised them or told them they did a good job. Share some of the good things from\nPsalm 146:6–9\nthat the Lord has done (help your children understand unfamiliar words). Invite your children to talk about other things He does for us. How can we praise Him for those things?\nLearn at home; share with others.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson has taught that the home should be the “center of gospel learning” (“\nBecoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 13). What can you do this week to deepen your personal or family study of Psalms? After your study, consider sharing with others what you learned and felt. You could do this in conversation, through text or social media, or at church.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "You might think of the book of Proverbs as a collection of wise counsel from loving parents (see\nProverbs 1:8\n). Its main message is that if you seek wisdom—especially God’s wisdom—life will go well. But Proverbs is followed by the book of Ecclesiastes, which seems to say, “It’s not that simple.” The Preacher quoted in Ecclesiastes observed that he “gave [his] heart to know wisdom” but still found “vexation of spirit” and “much grief” (\nEcclesiastes 1:17–18\n). In various ways, the book asks, “Can there be real meaning in a world where everything seems vain, temporary, and uncertain?”\nAnd yet, while the two books look at life from different perspectives, they teach similar truths. Ecclesiastes declares: “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man” (\nEcclesiastes 12:13\n). This is the same principle found throughout Proverbs: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart” (\nProverbs 3:5\n; see also\nverse 7\n). Life is always better—if not always perfect—when we trust and follow the Lord Jesus Christ.\nFor an overview of these books, see “\nProverbs, book of\n” and “\nEcclesiastes\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nProverbs 1–4\n;\n15–16\n;\nEcclesiastes 1–3\n;\n11–12\n“Incline thine ear unto wisdom.”\nThe books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are filled with insights about wisdom. Consider marking the word “wisdom” and related words, like “knowledge” and “understanding,” as you find them in\nProverbs 1–4\n;\n15–16\n;\nEcclesiastes 1–3\n;\n11–12\n. How do these chapters affect the way you think about wisdom? Based on what you find, how would you describe the wisdom that “the Lord giveth”? (\nProverbs 2:6\n). What blessings come from God’s wisdom?\nSee also\nMatthew 7:24–27\n;\n25:1–13\n.\nHelp learners share what they’re learning.\n“Give learners opportunities to share with each other what they are learning about the Savior and His gospel. Doing this will help them internalize the truths they are taught and express them. It will also help them gain confidence in their ability to share truths in other settings” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n26\n). For example, you could invite learners to write down some references from Proverbs or Ecclesiastes where they found insights about God’s wisdom. Then invite learners to talk about what they learned.\nProverbs 1:7\n;\n2:5\n;\n3:7\n;\n15:33\n;\n16:6\n;\n31:30\n;\nEcclesiastes 12:13\n“Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord.”\nAnother theme found throughout Proverbs and Ecclesiastes is “the fear of the Lord.” Watch for this phrase as you read. What do you feel it means to fear the Lord? Look for insights in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “\nTherefore They Hushed Their Fears\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 46–49). How is fear of the Lord different from other kinds of fear?\nSee also\nProverbs 8:13\n.\nProverbs 3:5–7\n;\n4\n“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart.”\nHow would you try to persuade someone that it’s better to “trust in the Lord” than to “lean … unto [our] own understanding”? (\nProverbs 3:5\n). What comparisons or object lessons would you use? As you ponder\nProverbs 3:5–7\n, think of ways you might complete sentences like these:\nTrusting the Lord is like … Leaning on our own understanding is like …\nWhy is it unwise to lean on our own understanding? How have you discovered that the Lord is trustworthy?\nEven so, we might find it difficult to trust the Lord at times. Why is that? Elder Gerrit W. Gong suggests some reasons, along with helpful counsel, in “\nTrust Again\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 97–99). What stories or teachings do you find in this message that might help someone restore their trust in the Lord?\nBoth\nProverbs 3:6\nand\nProverbs 4\ncompare life to a “path” or a “way.” What do you think it means to let the Lord “direct [your] paths”? (\nProverbs 3:6\n). What do you find in\nchapter 4\nthat helps you “ponder the path of [your] feet”? (\nverse 26\n). For example, what do\nverses 11–12\nand\n18–19\nteach about the blessings of following the right path? What do\nverses 26–27\nmean to you?\nSee also\n2 Nephi 31:18–21\n; “\nLord, I Would Follow Thee\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 220.\nProverbs 15\n;\n16:24–32\n“A soft answer turneth away wrath.”\nSome of the ideas in\nProverbs 15–16\nmight inspire you to improve the way you communicate with others, especially loved ones. For example, think about specific times when “a soft answer” helped to “[turn] away wrath” (\nProverbs 15:1\n).\nYou might also think of times when the Savior exemplified the teachings in\nProverbs 15:1–4, 18\n(see\nMark 12:13–17\n;\nJohn 8:1–11\n). How can you follow His example as you interact with others?\nHow might the counsel in\nProverbs 15\n;\n16:24–32\napply to today’s digital communication? See if you can find a verse in these chapters that you could rephrase as advice about interacting over social media or through text.\nSee also Neil L. Andersen, “\nFollowing Jesus: Being a Peacemaker\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 17–20; Ronald A. Rasband, “\nWords Matter\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 70–77;\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n(2022),\n11–12\n.\nWho Can Find a Virtuous Woman? II\n, by Louise Parker\nProverbs 31:10–31\n“A woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.”\nProverbs 31:10–31\ndescribes “a virtuous woman,” or a woman of great spiritual strength, capability, and influence. You might try summarizing in your own words what each of these verses says about virtuous women. Which of these traits can you emulate?\nEcclesiastes 1–3\n;\n12\nMortal life is temporary.\nWhy is it valuable for you to remember that much in this world, as\nEcclesiastes 1–2\nasserts, is “vanity” (or temporary and often unimportant)? What do you find in\nEcclesiastes 12\nthat gives life eternal value?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nProverbs 1:7\n;\n2:5\n;\n15:33\n;\n16:6\n;\nEcclesiastes 12:13\nTo “fear God” means to love and obey Him.\nTo help your children understand passages about fearing God, you could substitute the word “fear” with words like\nreverence\n,\nlove\n, or\nobedience\n(see also\nHebrews 12:28\n). How does this affect the way we think about these verses? How do we show that we fear the Lord?\nProverbs 3:5–7\nI can trust in the Lord with all my heart.\nYou and your children could make up actions to go with\nProverbs 3:5–7\n, like making a heart with your hands, leaning to one side, walking in place, and pointing to your eyes. How can we show that we trust Jesus Christ with all our hearts?\nTo show what it means to “lean not unto thine own understanding” (\nProverbs 3:5\n), consider inviting your children to lean against something sturdy and stable, like a wall. Then they could try leaning against something that is not sturdy, like a broom. Or they could try leaning a stick or a pencil against objects of varying sturdiness, such as a book or a piece of paper. Why is it important to “trust in the Lord” (\nverse 5\n) and not our “own understanding”?\nLearning to Trust the Lord\n, by Kathleen Peterson\nProverbs 15:1, 18\nI can use kind words.\nPerhaps you and your children can think of situations when you or they might feel angry. Read\nProverbs 15:1\ntogether, and help your children apply this verse to the situations they thought of. Maybe they could practice some “soft answers.” A song about kindness, such as “\nLove Is Spoken Here\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 190–91), could reinforce this principle.\nTo learn what it means to be “slow to anger” (\nProverbs 15:18\n), you and your children could share times when you (or someone you know) felt angry but chose to be kind. Help your children think of things we can be\nquick to\nif we are “slow to anger.” For example, we can be quick to think about Jesus, to ask Heavenly Father for help, to think of a Primary song, or, if possible, to walk away.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Even if this is your first time reading the book of Isaiah, you might find passages that sound familiar. That’s because, of all the Old Testament prophets, Isaiah is the one most often quoted in other books of scripture, including by the Savior Himself. Isaiah’s words also appear often in hymns and other sacred music.\nWhy is Isaiah quoted so often? Surely one reason is that Isaiah had a gift for expressing the word of God in vivid, memorable language. But it’s more than that. Isaiah has inspired prophets for generations because the truths he taught transcended his own generation (between 740 and 701 BC). He wrote of God’s great work of redemption, which is much bigger than one nation or one time period. From Isaiah, Nephi learned that he and his people, though separated from the rest of Israel, were still part of God’s covenant people. In Isaiah, New Testament writers found prophecies about the Messiah that were fulfilled right before their eyes. And in Isaiah, Joseph Smith found inspiration for the latter-day work of gathering Israel and building Zion. When you read Isaiah, what will you find?\nFor more about Isaiah and his writings, see “\nIsaiah\n” in the Bible Dictionary. For information about the time when Isaiah lived, see\n2 Kings 15–20\nand\n2 Chronicles 26–32\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 1–12\nThe words of Isaiah will all be fulfilled.\nThe Savior taught that “all things that [Isaiah] spake have been and shall be, even according to the words which he spake” (\n3 Nephi 23:3\n). As you study the book of Isaiah, consider making a chart of prophecies with headings like these:\nIsaiah’s day\n,\nThe Savior’s mortal ministry\n, and\nThe latter days\n. Note that many of Isaiah’s prophecies are fulfilled in more than one way (see Bible Dictionary, “\nIsaiah\n”).\nPresident Dallin H. Oaks taught: “The book of Isaiah contains numerous prophecies that seem to have multiple fulfillments. One seems to involve the people of Isaiah’s day or the circumstances of the next generation. Another meaning, often symbolic, seems to refer to events in the meridian of time, when Jerusalem was destroyed and her people scattered after the crucifixion of the Son of God. Still another meaning or fulfillment of the same prophecy seems to relate to the events attending the Second Coming of the Savior. The fact that many of these prophecies can have multiple meanings underscores the importance of our seeking revelation from the Holy Ghost to help us interpret them” (“\nScripture Reading and Revelation\n,”\nEnsign\n, Jan. 1995, 8).\nUnderstanding Isaiah.\nThe Savior said, “Search these things diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah” (\n3 Nephi 23:1\n; see also\nverses 2–3\n). Yet to many, Isaiah can be difficult to understand. The following ideas might help:\nPonder the symbols and metaphors Isaiah used.\nAsk yourself, “What am I learning about Jesus Christ?” (see\n1 Nephi 19:23\n).\nLook for topics that feel relevant to our time.\nUse study helps, such as a dictionary, the footnotes, chapter headings, and the\nGuide to the Scriptures\n.\nIsaiah 1\n;\n3–5\nProphets warn about sin and promise hope through repentance.\nLike prophets in all times, Isaiah continually warned the people about their spiritual condition. As you read\nIsaiah 1\n;\n3\n;\n5\n, look for phrases that describe how the people were doing spiritually (see, for example,\nIsaiah 1:2–4, 21–23\n;\n3:9, 16–17\n;\n5:11–12, 20–23\n). What similar problems do you see in our time? You might also look for verses that warn about the consequences of the Israelites’ spiritual condition (such as\nIsaiah 1:7\n;\n3:17–26\n;\n5:5–7, 13–15\n).\nIn addition to warnings, Isaiah gave messages of hope for redemption through the Savior (see, for example,\nIsaiah 1:16–19, 25–27\n;\n3:10\n;\n4\n). What do you learn about the Lord from these messages? How is the Lord’s message in these verses different from what Satan wants us to believe?\nLike Isaiah, prophets today warn us about sin and its consequences, and they provide messages of hope through Jesus Christ. What examples can you think of? You might want to review a message from a past general conference, looking for such warnings and promises.\nIsaiah 2\n;\n4\n;\n11–12\nGod will do a great work in the latter days.\nMany of Isaiah’s prophecies have specific meaning for our day. To find them, look for future-tense verbs (such as “shall be” or “shall go”). For example, look for these verbs as you read\nIsaiah 2\n;\n4\n;\n11–12\n. You might even try replacing them with present-tense verbs (like\nis\nor\nis going\n). Which prophecies are especially inspiring to you? What do you learn from these prophecies about Zion, building temples, and gathering Israel?\nIsaiah 2:2–3\nis especially relevant for Latter-day Saints. How are these prophecies being fulfilled? What do you learn about the Lord’s “ways” and “paths” in His house? (\nverse 3\n).\nSee also\nIsaiah 5:26\n; “\nHigh on the Mountain Top\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 5.\nIsaiah 6\nProphets are called by God.\nIn\nIsaiah 6\n, Isaiah recounted his call to be a prophet. As you read this chapter, what impresses you about Isaiah’s experience? How does this chapter influence the way you think about the Lord, His prophets, and the work they are called to do?\n“For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given” (\nIsaiah 9:6\n).\nIsaiah 7–9\nGod promised to send Jesus Christ to be my Savior.\nDuring Isaiah’s ministry, Israel formed an alliance with Syria to defend itself against Assyria. Israel and Syria wanted to force Ahaz, the king of Judah, to join them. But Isaiah prophesied that the alliance would fail and counseled Ahaz to trust in the Lord (\nIsaiah 7:7–9\n;\n8:12–13\n).\nWhile Isaiah counseled Ahaz, he made several well-known prophecies, such as those found in\nIsaiah 7:14\n;\n8:13–14\n;\n9:2, 6–7\n. Whatever these prophecies meant to Ahaz, they clearly apply to Jesus Christ (see also\nMatthew 1:21–23\n;\n4:16\n;\n21:44\n;\nLuke 1:31–33\n). Why is “Immanuel” a good title for the Savior? (see\nMatthew 1:23\n). How has He been a “Counsellor” or “Prince of Peace” to you? (\nIsaiah 9:7\n). What else do you learn about the Savior from these verses?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nIsaiah 1:2–4, 16–19\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I can repent and be clean.\nIn\nIsaiah 1:2–4\n, you and your children could find reasons that the Lord was not happy with the people. Note the comparison with animals in\nverse 3\n—who is our “master”? How do we show that we know Him?\nTo visualize\nIsaiah 1:16–18\n, you and your children could look at something bright red and something pure white. Or maybe you could work together to wash something. How do we become unclean spiritually? How does Jesus help us become clean? What do we learn about the Savior from these verses? Share with your children how you feel about Him and what He has done for you.\nIsaiah 2:2–4\nIn the temple, I learn about Jesus Christ.\nIsaiah foresaw a time when “the mountain of the Lord’s house” would attract people from “all nations” (\nIsaiah 2:2\n). How can you help your children feel excited about going to the Lord’s house? You could invite them to draw a picture of their home. Then read together\nIsaiah 2:2\n, and invite them to draw a picture of “the Lord’s house,” which is a temple. Read\nIsaiah 2:3\ntogether. Invite them to add to their pictures many people coming to the temple, including their families.\nYou could also read\nIsaiah 2:2–3\ntogether and identify something that inspires you and your children to go to the temple. Then, after reading\nIsaiah 2:4\ntogether, you could discuss how the temple brings them peace. Consider singing a song about the temple, such as “\nI Love to See the Temple\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 95). Help your children find words in the song that teach what the temple is and what we do there.\nSalt Lake Temple\nIsaiah 7:14\n;\n9:6–7\nJesus Christ came to earth to be my Savior.\nTo introduce Isaiah’s prophecies of Christ, you and your children could talk about titles of people, like president, bishop, or teacher. What do these titles tell us about these people? Help your children find titles of Jesus Christ in\nIsaiah 7:14\nand\n9:6–7\n(see also this week’s activity page). What do each of these titles teach about Him? What else do we learn about Jesus Christ from these verses?\nYou could also share with your children “\nIsaiah the Prophet\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 150–51). Pause periodically to ask what Isaiah knew about Jesus Christ many years before He was born. You can then use\nMatthew 1:21–23\n;\nLuke 1:31–33\nto talk about how Isaiah’s prophecies in\nIsaiah 7:14\n;\n9:6–7\nwere fulfilled.\n1:18\nIsaiah the Prophet\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "One thing that the Lord asks prophets to do is to warn about the consequences of sin. For Old Testament prophets, this often meant telling the rulers of mighty kingdoms that they needed to repent. It was a dangerous task, but Isaiah was fearless, and his warnings to the kingdoms of his day—including Israel, Judah, and surrounding nations—were bold (see\nIsaiah 13–23\n).\nHowever, Isaiah also had a message of hope. Even though the prophesied destructions did come upon these kingdoms, Isaiah foresaw a chance for restoration and renewal. The Lord would invite His people to return to Him. He would make “the parched ground … become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water” (\nIsaiah 35:7\n). He would perform “a marvellous work and a wonder” (\nIsaiah 29:14\n), restoring to Israel the blessings He had promised them. Neither Isaiah nor anyone else alive at that time lived to see this marvelous work. But we are seeing it today. In fact, we are part of it.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 13:1–11, 19–22\n;\n14:1–20\nPride and worldliness will fail.\nIn Isaiah’s day, Babylon was a mighty kingdom with a powerful ruler. Now Babylon is ancient history. So why is Isaiah’s message to Babylon, in\nIsaiah 13–14\n, important to us today? Because Babylon symbolizes pride, greed, and sin, things that still surround us today. Think about this symbolism as you read\nIsaiah 13:1–11, 19–22\n;\n14:1–20\n. You might consider questions like these:\nWhat similarities do you see between the pride of the Babylonian king and the pride of Satan? (see\nIsaiah 14:4–20\n;\nMoses 4:1–4\n). What warnings do you find for yourself in these verses?\nHow does the Savior provide “rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear”? (\nIsaiah 14:3\n).\n“He will swallow up death in victory” (\nIsaiah 25:8\n).\nIsaiah 22:22–23\n;\n24:21–23\n;\n25:6–8\n;\n26:19\n;\n28:16\nJesus Christ is the promised Messiah.\nThe teachings of Isaiah often refer to the Savior’s mission, including His atoning sacrifice, Resurrection, and Second Coming. What aspects of His mission come to mind as you read these verses:\nIsaiah 22:22–23\n;\n24:21–23\n;\n25:6–8\n;\n26:19\n;\n28:16\n? What other passages do you find that remind you of the Savior?\nGive learners opportunities to bear testimony of Jesus Christ.\n“To be a teacher of Jesus Christ’s gospel means to help others understand and rely on His teachings, redeeming power, and perfect love” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n8\n). One simple way to do that every time you teach is to ask a question like “What did you find in the scriptures this week that taught you something about the Savior?” Then let learners share their experiences and strengthen each other’s faith.\nIsaiah 24:1–12\n;\n28:1–8\n;\n29:7–13\n;\n30:8–14\nTurning away from the Lord brings spiritual danger.\nIn His mercy, the Lord sent Isaiah to warn the covenant people that they were straying from Him. See if you can find the spiritual warning signs of this in\nIsaiah 24:5\n;\n29:13\n;\n30:8–12\n. Why are these attitudes and actions spiritually dangerous?\nTo warn about the consequences of turning away from the Lord, Isaiah used some memorable comparisons. As you study them, ask yourself how turning away from the Lord is like:\nA sad, empty earth (\nIsaiah 24:1–12\n).\nDrunkenness (\nIsaiah 28:7–8\n).\nHunger and thirst (\nIsaiah 29:7–10\n).\nA broken wall or vessel (\nIsaiah 30:13–14\n).\nWhy is it important to you to stay close to the Lord?\nIsaiah 29\n;\n30:18–26\n;\n35\nThe Lord can restore what is lost or broken.\nHave you ever lost something that you thought you would never find again? Or maybe something broke, and you worried that it could never be repaired. When we turn away from the Lord, Satan wants us to think that we can never return or be healed. However, Isaiah described some of the marvelous things the Lord will do to help us return to Him. What do you learn from\nIsaiah 29:13–24\n;\n30:18–26\n;\n35\nabout the Lord, His love, and His power? Perhaps you could find a phrase in these passages that gives you hope when you need healing. You could also look in Sister Amy A. Wright’s message “\nChrist Heals That Which Is Broken\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 81–84).\nOne way the Lord manifests His power and mercy is through the Restoration of His gospel.\nIsaiah 29\ncontains several passages that have parallels with events of the Restoration. For example:\nCompare\nIsaiah 29:11–12\nwith\n2 Nephi 27:6–26\nand\nJoseph Smith—History 1:63–65\n.\nCompare\nIsaiah 29:13–14\nwith\nDoctrine and Covenants 4\nand\nJoseph Smith—History 1:17–19\n.\nCompare\nIsaiah 29:18–24\nwith the\ntitle page of the Book of Mormon\n.\nIn your opinion, why are “marvellous” and “wonder” (\nIsaiah 29:14\n) good words to describe the Lord restoring His gospel? How can you help fulfill the prophecies about the Restoration? For ideas, look in Elder Gerrit W. Gong’s message “\nAll Nations, Kindreds, and Tongues\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 38–41).\nSee also “\nThe Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: A Bicentennial Proclamation to the World\n” (Gospel Library); “\nThe Morning Breaks\n,”\nHymns\n, no 1.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nIsaiah 14:3\n;\n25:8–9\n;\n28:16\nJesus Christ can save me from sin and death.\nHow will you help your children see the Savior in the writings of Isaiah? You might help them find phrases that remind them of Him in\nIsaiah 14:3\n;\n25:8\n; or\n28:16\n. They could also match these verses from Isaiah with other verses that teach about the Savior, such as\nMatthew 11:28–30\n;\n1 Corinthians 15:53–57\n;\nHelaman 5:12\n. What great things has the Lord done for us?\nAfter reading\nIsaiah 25:8–9\ntogether, you could look at pictures of the Savior in Gethsemane, on the cross, and after His Resurrection. Let your children talk about what is happening in the pictures and why they love Jesus and “rejoice in his salvation” (\nverse 9\n).\nYou might choose to tell your children about the sadness you felt when someone you love passed away. Testify of the comfort you receive because of Jesus Christ. Maybe your children could draw a crying face and then erase the tears as you read\nIsaiah 25:8\ntogether.\nThy Will Be Done\n, by Ken Spencer\nIsaiah 25:4–6\nJesus gives me “refuge from the storm.”\nHave you and your children ever experienced the blessing of safe shelter during a storm or shade on a hot summer day? Or have you enjoyed a good meal when you were hungry? Talk about these experiences as you read\nIsaiah 25:4–6\n. How is Jesus like these things?\nIsaiah 29:11–18, 24\nThe Restoration of the gospel is a “marvellous work.”\nAs you and your children read\nIsaiah 29:14\n, share with them other words that mean the same thing as “marvellous” and “wonder.” Let them help you find objects or pictures that represent some of the Lord’s marvelous works during the latter days. These might include a copy of the Book of Mormon, a picture of a temple, or a picture of the First Vision (there’s one at the beginning of this outline). Then your children could choose an item and share why it is marvelous to them.\nA song about the Restoration of the gospel could go well with\nIsaiah 29\n, such as “\nOn a Golden Springtime\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 88). And perhaps a personal experience could help the children understand what\nrestoration\nmeans. For example, you and your children could talk about something that you lost and how you found it. Help your children compare this to the Restoration of the gospel. According to\nIsaiah 29:13–15\n, why do we need the Restoration? What marvelous works is the Lord doing to restore His gospel? (see this week’s activity page).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "“Comfort” is the first word of\nIsaiah chapter 40\n. It marks the beginning of a different tone, a different emphasis in the prophet’s message. Isaiah’s earlier writings warned Israel and Judah about destruction and captivity that would come because of their sins. But these later prophecies were meant to comfort the Jewish people over 150 years in the future—after Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed and the people were taken captive by Babylon. These prophecies, however, reach even further into the future than to the defeated, disheartened Israelites. They speak to us, who also sometimes feel defeated, disheartened, and even lost.\nIsaiah’s message to his people and to us is simple: “Fear not” (\nIsaiah 43:1\n). All is not lost. The Lord has not forgotten you, and He has power over situations that seem out of your control. Isn’t the Lord, who “created the heavens” (\nIsaiah 42:5\n), more powerful than Babylon, than sin, than whatever is holding you captive? “Return unto me,” He pleads, “for I have redeemed thee” (\nIsaiah 44:22\n). He can heal, restore, strengthen, forgive, and comfort—whatever is needed for you, in your case, to be redeemed.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 40–49\nJesus Christ can comfort me and give me hope.\nWhen the Israelites were captives in Babylon, many may have wondered if they had forever lost their place as God’s chosen, covenant people. As you read\nIsaiah 40–49\n, look for passages that might have provided comfort and hope. For each passage you find, ponder and record what the Lord might be saying to\nyou\nin these verses. Here are a few you might start with:\n40:11, 29–31\n:\n41:10–13, 17–18\n:\n42:6–7\n:\n43:1–7, 25\n:\n44:1–4, 21–24\n:\n46:3–4\n:\n49:7–16\n:\nWhat do you feel the Lord wants you to know about Him?\nYou might notice that the hymn “\nHow Firm a Foundation\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 85) draws on Isaiah’s words in\nIsaiah 41:10\n;\n43:2–5\n;\n46:4\n. Consider singing or listening to this hymn, looking for parallels between the lyrics and these verses from Isaiah. How has the Lord fulfilled the promises in these verses in your life?\nSee also Patrick Kearon, “\nHe Is Risen with Healing in His Wings: We Can Be More Than Conquerors\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 37–40.\nUse additional scripture.\nSometimes we can understand the Old Testament better if we supplement our study with verses from the Book of Mormon. For example, the Book of Mormon prophets Nephi and Jacob had access to the writings of Isaiah on the plates of brass (see\n1 Nephi 19:22–23\n), and they used these prophecies to teach about the Savior. To learn how Nephi and Jacob likened\nIsaiah 48–49\nto their people, see\n1 Nephi 22\n. That may help you liken these chapters to your own life.\nBy obeying the Lord, we can have “peace … as a river” (\nIsaiah 48:18\n).\nIsaiah 40–49\n“Thou art my servant.”\nThroughout\nIsaiah 40–49\nthe Lord speaks of His “servant” and His “witnesses.” These words can refer to Jesus Christ (see\nIsaiah 42:1–7\n), to the house of Israel (see\nIsaiah 45:4\n), and to King Cyrus, who allowed the Jewish people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (see\nIsaiah 44:26–28\n;\n45:1–4\n). You might also consider how the passages apply to you as a servant and a witness of the Lord. For example, ponder questions like these:\nIsaiah 40:1–3, 9–11\n;\n43:9–12\n.\nIn what sense are you a witness of Jesus Christ? What are the “good tidings” that you can share as His witness? You might imagine that you have been called to the witness stand in a court trial. In this trial, Jesus Christ has been charged with making the claim recorded in\nIsaiah 43:11\n. What testimony could you give in support of Jesus’s claim? What evidence from your life would you present?\nIsaiah 41:8–13\n;\n42:6\n;\n44:21\n.\nWhat has the Lord called you to do? Consider Church callings as well as other opportunities to serve Him. How has He “formed” or prepared you to become His servant? How does He support you as you serve?\nIsaiah 49:1–9\n.\nWhat messages do you find in these verses that can help when your efforts and service seem to be “for nought, and in vain”? (\nverse 4\n).\nIsaiah 40:3–8, 15–23\n;\n42:15–16\n;\n47:7–11\nGod’s power is greater than worldly power.\nIsaiah repeatedly reminded his people of God’s matchless power, even compared to the oppressive worldly power that surrounded them. Look for this message as you read\nIsaiah 40:3–8, 15–23\n;\n42:15–16\n; and\n47:7–11\n(note that\nchapter 47\nis addressed to Israel’s captor, Babylon). What do these passages teach you about worldly things? What do they teach you about God? Ponder why this message might have been valuable to Jewish people in captivity. Why is it valuable to you?\nIsaiah 48:10\n;\n49:13–16\nThe Lord can refine me through my afflictions.\nAs you read\nIsaiah 48:10\n, ponder your own “furnace of affliction.” How is the Lord “refining” you? How does\nIsaiah 49:13–16\nhelp you when you suffer afflictions?\nSee also “The Refiner’s Fire” (video), Gospel Library.\n5:2\nThe Refiner's Fire\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nIsaiah 40:3–5\nI can help prepare “the way of the Lord.”\nThink of some ways to illustrate what it might mean to “prepare … the way of the Lord,” as described in\nIsaiah 40:3–5\n. For example, you and your children could straighten something that’s crooked, clear a cluttered floor, or make a clear path in rocky ground. You could also show pictures of John the Baptist and Joseph Smith (see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n35\n,\n87\n). How did they prepare the way for the Lord’s coming? (see\nLuke 3:2–18\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 135:3\n). How can we help? This might be an opportunity to talk about how Aaronic Priesthood holders help prepare the way of the Lord (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:26–28\n).\nIsaiah 43:10\nI can be a witness of the Lord.\nAfter reading\nIsaiah 43:10\ntogether, you could talk about what it means to be a witness. Share with each other things you have experienced that you can be a “witness” of—for example, a food you have tasted, a place you have visited, or a person you know. What does it mean to be the Lord’s witness? What can we tell other people about Him?\nIsaiah 44:3–4\n;\n45:8\nThe Lord will “pour” His blessings on me.\nAfter reading these verses, your children could water a plant and talk about blessings the Lord has poured out on them. What happens to a plant when we water it? How have the Lord’s blessings helped us grow?\nOur “righteousness [can be] as the waves of the sea” (\nIsaiah 48:18\n).\nIsaiah 48:17–18\nKeeping God’s commandments brings peace.\nPictures or videos of rivers and ocean waves could help your children visualize\nIsaiah 48:18\n(such as the pictures in this outline). Your children might enjoy moving their hands and arms like a river and waves of the sea. How can peace be like a river? How can righteousness be like waves? Talk about how keeping God’s commandments has helped you feel peaceful like a river or strong like a wave.\nSing together a song about commandments, such as “\nKeep the Commandments\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 146–47). What does this song teach about why we should keep God’s commandments?\nIsaiah 49:14–16\nThe Lord will never forget me.\nIsaiah 49:14–16\ncan be a great comfort to your children for years to come. As you read\nverse 14\n, you could talk about what might make people feel forgotten or forsaken. How do we know the Lord has not forgotten us?\nTo introduce\nverses 15–16\n, you could ask your children about someone who they will never forget, like a family member or friend. According to\nIsaiah 49:15–16\n, why will the Lord never forget us? Then you could share with each other your feelings about Jesus Christ.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Throughout his ministry, Isaiah spoke of a mighty deliverer. These prophecies would have been especially precious to the Israelites centuries later when they were in captivity in Babylon. Someone who could tear down the walls of Babylon would be a mighty conqueror indeed. But that isn’t the kind of Messiah that Isaiah described in\nchapters 52–53\n: “He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him. … We did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted” (\nIsaiah 53:3–4\n).\nBy sending such an unexpected deliverer, God taught us about true deliverance. To save us from oppression and affliction, God sent One who Himself “was oppressed, and … afflicted.” Where some expected a lion, He sent a lamb (see\nIsaiah 53:7\n). Surely, God’s ways are not our ways (see\nIsaiah 55:8–9\n). Jesus Christ frees us not by just opening the prison but by taking our place there. He relieves us from our chains of grief and sorrow by bearing them Himself (see\nIsaiah 53:4–5, 12\n). He does not save us from a distance. He suffers with us, in acts of “everlasting kindness” that “shall not depart from thee” (\nIsaiah 54:8, 10\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 50–52\nThe future is bright for the Lord’s people.\nEven though the Israelites spent many years in captivity—and even though that captivity was a result of their own poor choices—the Lord wanted them to look to the future with hope. What do you find in Isaiah’s message that gives you hope? A chart like this one might help you study:\nWhat I learn about God\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:2, 5–9\n;\n51:3–8, 15–16\n;\n52:3, 9–10\n)\nMessages of hope\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:9\n;\n51:3–5, 11–12, 22–23\n;\n52:9–10\n)\nWhat I can do to make hope a reality\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:10\n;\n51:1–2, 6–9\n;\n52:1–3, 9–11\n)\nSee also\nMosiah 12:20–24\n;\n15:13–18\n;\n3 Nephi 20:29–46\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 113:7–10\n; Russell M. Nelson, “\nEmbrace the Future with Faith\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 73–76.\nBecause of Love\n, by Angela Johnson\nHelp learners come unto Jesus Christ.\n“Nothing you do as a teacher will bless learners more than helping them know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and feel Their love” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n8\n). As you prepare to teach\nIsaiah 50–57\nto others, consider how you can help them see connections between Israel’s challenges, Isaiah’s prophecies of Christ, and receiving divine help with their own struggles.\nIsaiah 53\nJesus Christ took upon Himself my sins and sorrows.\nFew chapters in scripture describe Jesus Christ’s redemptive mission more beautifully than\nIsaiah 53\n. Consider activities like these to better understand and apply these powerful teachings:\nPonder or discuss how stories and movies often depict heroes who rescue people. Contrast those depictions with the descriptions of the Savior in\nIsaiah 53\n.\nAfter reading each verse, pause to contemplate what the Savior suffered—the “griefs,” “sorrows,” and “transgressions” He bore—for all people and specifically for you. You might replace words like “we” and “our” with “I” and “my” as you read. What feelings or thoughts do these verses inspire in you?\nConsider watching the video “My Kingdom Is Not of This World” (Gospel Library), and ponder how the prophecies in\nIsaiah 53\nwere fulfilled. What are some of the griefs and sorrows the Savior carries for you?\n5:25\nMy Kingdom Is Not of This World\nFind pictures of the events surrounding the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 56–60\n). You could then find phrases in\nIsaiah 53\nthat describe the events in the pictures. What do these teachings inspire you to do?\nSee also “\nBehold the Great Redeemer Die\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 191.\nIsaiah 54\n;\n57:15–19\nJesus Christ wants me to return to Him.\nWe all have times when we feel distant from the Lord because of our sins or weaknesses. Some have even given up hope that He will ever forgive them.\nIsaiah 54\nand\n57\nare great chapters to read for reassurance and encouragement during such times. Particularly in\nIsaiah 54:4–10\n;\n57:15–19\n, what words teach you how the Savior feels about you? What difference does it make in your life to know these things about Him?\nPresident Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:\n“It matters not how completely ruined our lives may seem. It matters not how scarlet our sins, how deep our bitterness, how lonely, abandoned, or broken our hearts may be. Even those who are without hope, who live in despair, who have betrayed trust, surrendered their integrity, or turned away from God can be rebuilt. …\n“The joyous news of the gospel is this: because of the eternal plan of happiness provided by our loving Heavenly Father and through the infinite sacrifice of Jesus the Christ, we can not only be redeemed from our fallen state and restored to purity, but we can also transcend mortal imagination and become heirs of eternal life and partakers of God’s indescribable glory” (“\nHe Will Place You on His Shoulders and Carry You Home\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 102).\nSee also Patrick Kearon, “\nGod’s Intent Is to Bring You Home\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 87–89.\nIsaiah 55–56\nThe Lord invites all to “take hold of my covenant.”\nFor generations, Israel had been identified as God’s covenant people. However, God’s plan has always included more than just one nation, for “every one that thirsteth” is invited to “come … to the waters” (\nIsaiah 55:1\n). Keep this in mind as you read\nIsaiah 55\nand\n56\n, and ponder what it means to be God’s people. What is God’s message to those who feel “utterly separated” from Him? (\nIsaiah 56:3\n). Consider marking verses that describe attitudes and actions of those who “take hold of my covenant” (see\nIsaiah 56:4–7\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nIsaiah 51–52\nThe Lord invites me to “put on [my] strength.”\nIt might be fun for your children to discover phrases like “awake,” “stand up,” and “put on thy strength” in\nIsaiah 51:9, 17\n;\n52:1–2, 9\nand then act out those phrases. After doing so, you could talk about what it means to awake, stand up, and put on strength spiritually. What is the Lord asking us to do in these verses?\nYour children could also read\nIsaiah 51:1, 4, 7\nand identify who the Lord is speaking to and what He wants them to do. What does it mean to “hearken unto” the Lord? How can we show the Lord that we “hearken unto” Him?\nIsaiah 53:3–9\nJesus Christ took upon Himself my sins and sorrows.\nYou and your children could look at several pictures showing the suffering and death of Jesus Christ (see, for example,\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n56\n,\n57\n,\n58\n). Then you could read together\nIsaiah 53:3–6, 9\nand look for words that describe what is happening in the pictures. Help your children understand that Isaiah shared these truths hundreds of years before they happened. Why would it be important for people to know these things so many years in advance? (see\nAlma 39:15–19\n).\nAfter reading from\nIsaiah 53:4\n, “He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,” your children could try to lift a heavy object (or pretend to lift one). Talk about how “grief” and “sorrow” or sadness can feel heavy and hard to carry. Why did Jesus carry our “griefs,” “sorrows,” and “iniquities” or sins? (see also\nAlma 7:11–12\n).\nIsaiah 55:6\nI can seek the Lord and call upon Him.\nTo teach your children about\nIsaiah 55:6\n, you could hide a picture of Jesus somewhere in the room. You could invite your children to find the picture and name one way they can “seek … the Lord while he may be found.” A song like “\nSeek the Lord Early\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 108) could give them ideas. Then you could let one of the children hide the picture and repeat the activity.\nIsaiah 55:8–9\nThe Lord’s ways are higher than mine.\nAfter reading\nIsaiah 55:9\n, it might be fun for your children to stand on a stool and talk about how things look different when you are “higher.” Or they could draw a picture of what\nIsaiah 55:9\nmeans to them. You could then discuss some of the Lord’s ways that are higher than our ways. For example, what is His way of treating sinners? (see\nMark 2:15–17\n). What is His way of leading others? (see\nMatthew 20:25–28\n). Share with your children how you have learned to trust the Lord’s higher ways and thoughts.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Early in His ministry, Jesus Christ visited a synagogue in Nazareth, where He was raised. He stood there to read from the scriptures, opened the book of Isaiah, and read what we now know as\nIsaiah 61:1–2\n. He then announced, “This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.” This was one of the Savior’s most straightforward declarations that He was the Anointed One, who would “heal the brokenhearted” and “preach deliverance to the captives” (see\nLuke 4:16–21\n). This scripture was indeed fulfilled on that day. And, like many other prophecies of Isaiah, it is also being fulfilled in our day. The Savior continues to heal the brokenhearted who come unto Him. There are still many captives who need deliverance. And there is a glorious future to prepare for—a time when the Lord will “create new heavens and a new earth” (\nIsaiah 65:17\n) and “cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations” (\nIsaiah 61:11\n). Reading Isaiah opens our eyes to what the Lord has already done, what He is doing, and what He will yet do for His people.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 58:3–12\nFasting builds spiritual power and blesses people in need.\nWhy would anyone voluntarily go without food when food is available? As you study\nIsaiah 58:3–12\n, you might think about your reasons for fasting—as well as the Lord’s reasons for giving this law. Here are some other questions to ponder:\nWhy can fasting sometimes be perceived like more of a burden than a blessing? (see\nIsaiah 58:3–5\n). How do the Lord’s teachings in this chapter change that perception for you?\nWhat might it mean to “loose the bands of wickedness” and “break every yoke”? (\nIsaiah 58:6\n). How can fasting bless others? (see\nverse 7\n).\nHow has fasting brought you the blessings described in\nIsaiah 58:8–12\n?\nIn his message “\nIs Not This the Fast That I Have Chosen?\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 22–25), President Henry B. Eyring shared several examples of how people have been blessed by fasting and fast offerings. How have you witnessed similar blessings in your life?\nSee also “\nBless Our Fast, We Pray\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 138; Topics and Questions, “\nFasting and Fast Offerings,\n” Gospel Library.\nGet to know the people you teach.\n“Being a Christlike teacher includes getting to know the people you teach and striving to understand what is in their hearts. … You can find out how they learn best. You can ask questions, listen carefully, and observe. Above all, you can pray for the understanding that only the Spirit can give. The better you know a person, the better able you are to help him or her find personal meaning and power in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Once you understand a person’s thirst, the Spirit can teach you how to help quench it with the Savior’s living water” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n13\n).\nIsaiah 58:13–14\nHonoring the Lord on the Sabbath brings joy.\nIs the Sabbath day “a delight” for you? As you study\nIsaiah 58:13–14\n, consider how you could find more delight in the Lord’s day. For example, what might it mean to turn “from doing thy pleasure on [His] holy day”? What is the difference between “[delighting] thyself in the Lord” and “doing thine own ways”?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nThe Sabbath Is a Delight\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 129–32.\nIsaiah 59:9–21\n;\n61:1–3\n;\n63:7–9\nJesus Christ is my Savior and Redeemer.\nIsaiah 58–66\nhas multiple references to the atoning mission of Jesus Christ. Look for them as you study. In particular, note the titles and words used to describe the Savior. For example:\nWhat impresses you about the description of the “intercessor” in\nIsaiah 59:16–21\n? How does the Savior overcome the conditions described in\nverses 9–15\n?\nWhen Jesus Christ announced to the people of Nazareth that He was the Messiah, He quoted from\nIsaiah 61:1–3\n(see\nLuke 4:16–21\n; see also the video “Jesus Declares He Is the Messiah,” Gospel Library). How has Jesus Christ blessed you and others in the ways described in these verses? How has He given beauty in place of ashes?\n3:24\nJesus Declares He Is the Messiah\nWhat “lovingkindnesses of the Lord” can you “mention”? (see\nIsaiah 63:7–9\n).\nWhat other references to the Savior do you find in\nIsaiah 58–66\n?\nSee also\nMosiah 3:7\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 133:46–53\n.\nA Gift of Light\n, by Eva Timothy\nIsaiah 60\n;\n62\n“The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light.”\nIsaiah 60\nand\n62\nspeak of light and dark, eyes and seeing to teach about how the gospel of Jesus Christ will bless the world in the last days. Look for these concepts in\nIsaiah 60:1–5, 19–20\n;\n62:1–2\n. As you read these chapters, ponder how God is gathering His children out of darkness to His light. What is your role in this work?\nSee also\n1 Nephi 22:3–12\n;\n3 Nephi 18:24\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 14:9\n; Bonnie H. Cordon, “\nThat They May See\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 78–80.\nIsaiah 64:1–5\n;\n65:17–25\n;\n66\nChrist will reign on earth during the Millennium.\nIsaiah spoke of a day when “the former troubles are forgotten” (\nIsaiah 65:16\n). While this prophecy has several fulfillments, in its fullest sense, that day is yet to come—when Jesus Christ will return. Isaiah described this future day in\nIsaiah 64:1–5\n;\n65:17–25\n;\n66\n. Notice how often he used words like “rejoice” and “rejoicing.” Why will the Savior’s return be a day of rejoicing for you? What can you do to prepare for His coming?\nSee also\nArticles of Faith 1:10\n; Russell M. Nelson, “\nThe Future of the Church: Preparing the World for the Savior’s Second Coming\n,”\nEnsign\n, Apr. 2020, 13–17.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nIsaiah 58:6–11\nFasting blesses me and others in need.\nPerhaps the best way to encourage your children to fast—when they are ready—is to help them understand the Lord’s purposes for this law. Consider reading together\nIsaiah 58:6–11\nto find answers to these questions: Why do we fast? How do we fast? You could also look in “\nFast, Fasting\n” in the Guide to the Scriptures.\nIf you have had a meaningful experience with fasting, share it with your children. You could also ask them how they would explain to a friend why the Lord gave us this law.\nIsaiah 58:13–14\nThe Sabbath can be a delight to me.\nAfter reading\nIsaiah 58:13–14\n, you could point to the days of the week on a calendar and invite your children to say the days with you. When you get to the Sabbath, ask them to call that day “a delight.” Tell them why the Sabbath is a delight to you.\nShare with each other ways you can “delight thyself in the Lord” on the Sabbath. Maybe your children could draw their ideas and put them in a “box of Sabbath delights.” Then, when they need ideas about things to do on the Sabbath, they could pull an idea from the box.\nOur Light\n, by Dan Wilson\nIsaiah 60:1–3\nThe Savior is like a light for me.\nYou could invite your children to close their eyes as you read\nIsaiah 60:1–3\n. Ask them to open their eyes when they hear the word “light” and close them again when they hear the word “darkness.” Explain that Jesus Christ and His gospel are like a light that helps us see our way back to Heavenly Father.\nIsaiah 65:17–25\nWhen Jesus comes again, He will bring peace and joy.\nIsaiah 65:17–25\ndescribes what the earth will be like when the Savior comes again. As you read these verses with your children, help them look for how life will be different in the “new earth” Isaiah described. Why will this be a time to be “glad and rejoice for ever”? (\nverse 18\n).\nYou could also sing together a song about the Second Coming, such as “\nWhen the Savior Comes Again\n” (Gospel Library). Share with each other what you are looking forward to about the Savior’s return. What can we do to prepare for that day?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "At first, Jeremiah didn’t think he would make a good prophet. “Behold, I cannot speak,” he protested (\nJeremiah 1:6\n). But the Lord reassured him, “I have put my words in thy mouth” (\nverse 9\n). Jeremiah felt that he was an inexperienced “child” (\nverse 6\n), but the Lord explained that he was actually more prepared than he realized—he had been ordained to this calling even before he was born (see\nverse 5\n). So Jeremiah set aside his fears and accepted the call. He warned Jerusalem’s kings and priests that their pretended holiness would not save them. The “child” who thought he could not speak came to feel God’s word “in [his] heart as a burning fire” and could not be silent (\nJeremiah 20:9\n).\nJeremiah’s story is also your story. God knew you, too, before you were born and prepared you for your mission in life. Among other things, that mission includes something Jeremiah foresaw: gathering God’s people, one by one, to “bring [them] to Zion” (\nJeremiah 3:14\n). And even if you don’t know exactly what to do or say, you can “be not afraid … ; for I am with thee, saith the Lord” (\nJeremiah 1:8, 19\n).\nFor an overview of the book of Jeremiah, see “\nJeremiah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJeremiah 1:4–19\n;\n7:1–7\n;\n20:8–9\nProphets are called to speak God’s word.\nImagine you’re talking to a friend who has never heard of prophets, and you decide to explain the concept using Jeremiah’s call to be a prophet in\nJeremiah 1:4–19\n. What do you find in these verses that teaches something about prophets of God? You could also look in\nJeremiah 7:1–7\n;\n20:8–9\nand a hymn like “\nWe Listen to a Prophet’s Voice\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 22).\nYou might also want to teach your friend about today’s living prophet. Is there anything in these verses that might help? For example, what do prophets in our day “root out” or “pull down”? What do they “build” and “plant”? (\nJeremiah 1:10\n). How have you come to know that our living prophet is called of God?\nSee also\nArticles of Faith 1:6, 9\n; “Why Do We Have Prophets?” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\n1:37\nWhy Do We Have Prophets?\nJeremiah 1:5\nGod knew me before I was born.\nWhat did Jeremiah learn about himself in\nJeremiah 1:5\n? As a newly called prophet, why would that information be important for him to know?\nMuch of what Jeremiah learned about himself in\nJeremiah 1:5\nis also true about you. God also knew you before you were born and prepared you for specific responsibilities. To learn more about your life before you were born, read\nAlma 13:1–4\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:53–56\n; and\nAbraham 3:22–23\n. You might make a list of truths you discover. Why is this information important for you to know?\nTo learn about how these truths affected the life of Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt, study his message “\nYou Can Gather Israel!\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 61–63). How does knowing about your premortal life affect the way you live your mortal life?\nHere is what President Russell M. Nelson said about your premortal life:\n“Your Heavenly Father has known you for a very long time. You, as His son or daughter, were chosen by Him to come to earth at this precise time, to be a leader in His great work on earth. You were chosen\nnot\nfor your bodily characteristics but for your\nspiritual\nattributes, such as bravery, courage, integrity of heart, a thirst for truth, a hunger for wisdom, and a desire to serve others.\n“You developed some of these attributes premortally. Others you can develop here on earth as you persistently seek them” (“\nDecisions for Eternity\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 107).\nThink of some situations you might face in which it would be important to remember these truths about your premortal life. What can you do to remind yourself of these truths?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nDecisions for Eternity\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 106–9; Topics and Questions, “\nForeordination\n,” “\nPremortal Life\n,” Gospel Library.\nIn\nJeremiah 2:13\n, the Lord compared the people’s spiritual state to “broken cisterns” and compared Himself to the “fountain of living waters.”\nJeremiah 2\n;\n7\n“They have forsaken me the fountain of living waters.”\nIn the dry region where the Israelites lived, people stored precious water in underground reservoirs called cisterns. What do you think the “broken cisterns” mentioned in\nJeremiah 2:13\nmight symbolize? Why would receiving water from a fountain be better than relying on a cistern? What does it mean to forsake “the fountain of living waters”? As you read\nJeremiah 2\nand\n7\n, notice how the people were forsaking the Lord’s living waters (see, for example,\nJeremiah 2:26–28\n;\n7:2–11\n). Why is “living water” a good symbol for what the Savior gives you? Think about how you are receiving living water.\nJeremiah 7\nis addressed to people who were entering “the Lord’s house … to worship the Lord,” but their actions didn’t match their outward devotion (see\nverses 2–11\n). What messages do you feel the Lord might have for you in\nverses 21–23\n?\nUse object lessons.\nThe Lord’s prophets often compare spiritual truths to familiar objects. Consider doing the same as you learn and teach the gospel. For example, to visualize\nJeremiah 2:13\n, you could put water in a cracked or broken container or drink from a drinking fountain. How is Jesus like a “fountain of living waters”? (\nJeremiah 2:13\n). How do we drink from His living water?\nJeremiah 3:14–18\n;\n16:14–21\nThe Lord will gather His people.\nIn\nJeremiah 16:14–15\n, Jeremiah compared the gathering of Israel in the latter days with the Exodus of Israel from Egypt. In your opinion, why would the gathering be even more important to God’s people than the Exodus?\nWhat do\nJeremiah 3:14–18\n;\n16:14–21\nsuggest about how the gathering happens?\nIn his message “\nHope of Israel\n,” President Russell M. Nelson, like Jeremiah, taught that the gathering of Israel “is the most important thing taking place on earth today” (worldwide youth devotional, June 3, 2018, Gospel Library). Read or listen to his message, and see if you can discover (a) how President Nelson defines the gathering of Israel, (b) how he describes its importance, and (c) how you can be part of the gathering.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nJeremiah 1:5\nHeavenly Father knew me before I was born.\nTo introduce the important truth taught in\nJeremiah 1:5\n, you could show your children a picture of a baby (or, if possible, you could look at pictures of your children when they were babies). Ask your children if they know where they lived before they were born. You could also sing together a song that teaches about our premortal life, such as “\nI Lived in Heaven\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 4).\nIf your children would like to learn more, you could help them find “\nPremortal Life\n” in the Guide to the Scriptures. They could look for answers to “who,” “when,” and “what” questions about the premortal life.\nJeremiah 1:4–19\nProphets are called to speak the words of the Lord.\nConsider showing pictures of the living prophet or prophets from the scriptures (you can find some in\nChurch magazines\n, the\nGospel Art Book\n, and\nCome, Follow Me\n). Ask your children what they know about these prophets.\nTo teach about what prophets do, you might select some helpful verses from\nJeremiah 1\n, such as\nverses 5, 7, 10\n, and\n19\n. Your children could each pick one of the verses, read it, and share something they learn about prophets.\nJeremiah 16:14–16\nI can help Heavenly Father’s children come back to Him.\nWhile you read\nJeremiah 16:16\n, your children could pretend to “fish” or “hunt” for objects around the room. President Russell M. Nelson has compared the fishers and hunters in this verse to missionaries (see “\nThe Gathering of Scattered Israel\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2006, 81). What do missionaries do? How can we help “fish” and “hunt” for scattered Israel? (see “A Message for Children from President Russell M. Nelson” [video],\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n).\n3:30\nVideo: A Message for Children from President Russell M. Nelson\nJeremiah 18:1–6\nI can let the Lord guide my life, like a potter shapes clay.\nTo explore these verses, you might discuss or show how pottery is made (see the picture at the end of this outline). What message does the Lord have for us in\nJeremiah 18:1–6\n? What does it mean to be clay in the Lord’s hands? (see also\nIsaiah 64:8\n). For another story that compares us to potter’s clay, see Elder Richard J. Maynes’s message “\nThe Joy of Living a Christ-Centered Life\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2015, 27–30).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "When the Lord first called Jeremiah to be a prophet, He told him that his mission would be “to root out, and to pull down” (\nJeremiah 1:10\n)—and in Jerusalem, there was plenty of wickedness to root out and pull down. But this was only part of Jeremiah’s mission—he was also called “to build, and to plant” (\nJeremiah 1:10\n). What could be built or planted in the desolate ruins left by the rebellion of the covenant people? Asked another way, when sin or adversity has left our lives in ruins, how can we rebuild and plant again? The answer lies in “the Branch of righteousness” (\nJeremiah 33:15\n), the promised Messiah. He brings “a new covenant” (\nJeremiah 31:31\n)—one that requires more than the outward appearance of devotion. His law must be “in [our] inward parts,” written “in [our] hearts.” That’s what it means for the Lord to “be [our] God” and for us to “be [His] people” (\nJeremiah 31:33\n). It’s a lifelong process, and we will still make mistakes and have cause to mourn from time to time. But when we do, the Lord promises, “I will turn their mourning into joy” (\nJeremiah 31:13\n).\nFor an overview of Lamentations, see “\nLamentations, Book of\n” in the Guide to the Scriptures.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJeremiah 31\n;\n33\nThe Lord will bring His covenant people out of captivity.\nIn\nJeremiah 31\n;\n33\nthe Lord acknowledged the “lamentation, and bitter weeping” (\nJeremiah 31:15\n) the Israelites would experience in captivity. However, he also offered words of comfort and hope. Look for them as you read these chapters. What promises do you find that apply to you?\nJeremiah 31:31–34\n;\n32:37–42\n“They shall be my people, and I will be their God.”\nAlthough the Israelites had broken their covenants, Jeremiah prophesied that the Lord would again establish a “new” and “everlasting covenant” with them (\nJeremiah 31:31\n;\n32:40\n). What is that covenant? Consider looking for insights in Guide to the Scriptures, “\nNew and Everlasting Covenant\n,” Gospel Library.\nAs you read\nJeremiah 31:31–34\n;\n32:37–42\n, ponder:\nWhat it means to you to be part of God’s covenant people.\nWhat it means to have His law written in your heart.\nWhat the Lord promises when you make covenants with Him.\nHow your covenant relationship with the Lord changes you.\nWhat promises have you made to God as you have participated in sacred ordinances? How is He fulfilling His promises to you?\nSee also David A. Bednar, “\nAbide in Me, and I in You; Therefore Walk with Me\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 123–26.\nJeremiah 36\nThe scriptures have power to turn me away from evil.\nAccording to\nJeremiah 36:2–3\n, why did the Lord command Jeremiah to record his prophecies? As you read\nJeremiah 36\n, note how the following people felt about these prophecies:\nThe Lord (see\nverses 1–3, 27–31\n)\nJeremiah (see\nverses 4–7, 32\n)\nBaruch (see\nverses 4, 8–10, 14–18\n)\nJehudi and King Jehoiakim (see\nverses 20–26\n)\nElnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah (see\nverse 25\n)\nPonder how you feel about the scriptures. How have they helped you turn away from evil?\nJeremiah 37–39\nBe firm in following God’s prophets.\nIn\nJeremiah 37:1–3, 15–21\n;\n38:1–6, 14–28\n, what evidence do you see that King Zedekiah believed Jeremiah was the Lord’s true prophet? What evidence do you see that Zedekiah did not believe? What do you learn from this comparison? As you read\nJeremiah 39\n, ponder the difference it would have made if Zedekiah and his people had followed the prophet and kept the commandments of the Lord. (Compare what happened to Zedekiah with what happened to Lehi’s family in\n1 Nephi 1–2\n.)\nJeremiah 38:6–13\n;\n39:15–18\nI can be bold in standing up for what is right.\nThe king’s officials felt that Jeremiah’s prophecies were making their soldiers less willing to fight, so they threw Jeremiah into a filthy dungeon (see\nJeremiah 38:1–4\n). In\nJeremiah 38:6–13\n, what impresses you about the response of Ebed-melech the Ethiopian? Notice also the blessing the Lord gave Ebed-melech in\nJeremiah 39:15–18\n.\nHow could you follow Ebed-melech’s example?\nThe Cry of Jeremiah\nLamentations 1\n;\n3\nThe Lord can relieve the sorrow I experience because of sin.\nThe book of Lamentations is a collection of poems written after the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple. Why do you think it is important they were preserved? Consider what the metaphors in\nLamentations 1\nand\n3\nhelp you understand about the great sorrow Israel felt. What messages of hope in Christ do you find? (see especially\nLamentations 3:20–33\n; see also\nMatthew 5:4\n;\nJames 4:8–10\n;\nAlma 36:17–20\n).\nPresident M. Russell Ballard mentioned several situations that may cause some to lose hope, and he offered counsel about where to find hope:\n“Some of us may find our lives laden with frustration, disappointment, and sorrow. Many feel helpless to deal with the chaos that seems to prevail in the world. Others anguish over family members who are being carried downstream in a swift, raging current of weakening values and declining moral standards. … Many have even resigned themselves to accept the wickedness and cruelty of the world as being irreparable. They have given up hope. …\n“… Some among us may have lost all hope because of sin and transgression. A person can become so deeply immersed in the ways of the world that he sees no way out and loses all hope. My plea to all who have fallen into this trap of the adversary is to never give up! Regardless of how desperate things may seem or how desperate they may yet become, please believe me, you can always have hope. Always” (“\nThe Joy of Hope Fulfilled\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 1992, 31–32).\nSee also “\nCome, Ye Disconsolate\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 115.\nHelp others take responsibility for their own learning.\nSometimes it seems like the easiest way to teach is to just tell learners what we think they should know. However, the easiest way is not always the best way. Elder David A. Bednar taught: “Our intent ought not to be ‘What do I tell them?’ Instead, the questions to ask ourselves are ‘What can I invite them to do? What inspired questions can I ask that, if they are willing to respond, will begin to invite the Holy Ghost into their lives?’” (\nevening with a General Authority\n, Feb. 7, 2020, broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; see also\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n25\n). There are many ways to help learners take responsibility for their learning. For example, in this outline learners are invited to search, ponder, make lists, look at pictures, participate in object lessons, draw, and share and apply what they learn.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nJeremiah 31:3\nHeavenly Father and Jesus love me “with an everlasting love.”\nAs you read\nJeremiah 31:3\nwith your children, they could help you find objects (or pictures of objects) that last a long time, such as a metal coin, and some that do not, such as a piece of fruit. You could talk about what “everlasting” means and share with each other how you have felt Heavenly Father’s “everlasting love.” You could also sing together a song like “\nGod Is Watching Over All\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 229).\nJeremiah 31:31–34\n;\n32:38–41\nGod will help me keep my covenants.\nYour children might enjoy drawing a heart on a piece of paper and then writing in the heart things they learn from\nJeremiah 31:31–34\nabout making covenants with God. You may want to review the covenant they make at baptism (see\nMosiah 18:10, 13\n) and discuss what it means to have these promises written in their hearts.\nJeremiah 36:1–4\nThe scriptures are the word of God.\nThis week’s activity page could help your children learn about Jeremiah, Baruch, and the king (see\nJeremiah 36\n). They could also do actions that go along with the words in\nJeremiah 36:4–10\n, such as writing in a book (see\nverse 4\n) and reading the scriptures to the people (see\nverses 8, 10\n).\nYou and your children could look at a children’s book and a copy of the scriptures and talk about how these books are different. What makes the scriptures special? It may be inspiring to share with each other some scripture passages that are special to you.\nJeremiah 38:6–13\nI can stand up for what is right.\nYou could use the picture at the end of the outline to help your children visualize the story of Ebed-melech in\nJeremiah 38:6–13\n. Maybe you could help them find a verse where Ebed-melech did something brave to help the Lord’s prophet. What can we do to show that we know our prophet today is called of God?\nLamentations 1:1–2, 16\n;\n3:22–26\nThe Savior made it possible for me to be forgiven of my sins.\nTo introduce Lamentations, you may want to explain to your children that because the Israelites had not repented, Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed. You could share with each other how you might have felt if you were living there at that time (see\nLamentations 1:1–2, 16\n). How might the message in\nLamentations 3:22–26\nhave given you hope?\nYou could also tell each other about times you felt sad about a bad choice you made. What do we find in\nLamentations 3:22–26\nthat helps us understand the forgiveness Jesus Christ offers?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Ezekiel was a prophet in exile. Along with other Israelites, he had been captured and sent to Babylon. In Jerusalem, Ezekiel would have been a priest serving in the temple. In Babylon, he was among “them of the captivity,” and he “sat where they sat” (\nEzekiel 3:15\n), hundreds of miles from the beloved house of God and with little hope of returning. Then one day Ezekiel had a vision. He saw “the glory of the Lord” (\nEzekiel 1:28\n)—not back in the temple at Jerusalem but there in Babylon among the exiles. The wickedness in Jerusalem, he learned, had become so severe that God’s presence was no longer there (see\nEzekiel 8–11\n;\n33:21\n).\nAnd yet there’s something hopeful about Ezekiel’s message. Despite how far the covenant people had fallen, God had not totally abandoned them. If they would “hear the word of the Lord” (\nEzekiel 37:4\n), what was once dead could be revived. Their “stony heart” could be replaced with “a new heart” (\nEzekiel 36:26\n). And in the future, the Lord would establish a new temple and a new Jerusalem, “and the name of the city from that day shall be, The Lord is there” (\nEzekiel 48:35\n).\nFor an overview of the book of Ezekiel, see “\nEzekiel\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nEzekiel 3\n;\n34\nThe Lord invites me to feed His sheep.\nIn\nEzekiel 3\nand\n34\n, the Lord refers to leaders of His people as watchmen and shepherds. As you read these chapters, consider what these titles suggest about what it means to be a leader.\nWho are the “sheep” the Lord wants you to feed? What do you find in\nEzekiel 34\nthat could help someone preparing to serve a mission, raising children, or fulfilling a ministering assignment? How can you follow the Savior’s example as our shepherd? (see\nverses 11–31\n).\nYou might also ponder the symbolism you find in this chapter. What might the “good pasture” and “good fold” represent in\nverse 14\n? What’s the difference between a sheep who is “lost” and one who is “driven away”? (\nverse 16\n). What other symbols do you find?\nSee also\nJohn 21:15–17\n; Gerrit W. Gong, “\nMinistering\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 16–19.\nEzekiel 33:10–19\nThe Lord wants to forgive.\n“If our … sins be upon us,” the captive Israelites wondered, “how should we then live?” (\nEzekiel 33:10\n). In response, the Lord taught them about repentance and forgiveness. These questions might help you ponder what He taught:\nWhat do you think it means to “trust to [your] own righteousness”? (see\nEzekiel 33:12–13\n).\nWhat would you say to someone who feels that the people described in\nEzekiel 33:12–19\nare not being treated fairly? (see also\nMatthew 21:28–31\n;\nLuke 18:9–14\n).\nWhat do you find in these verses that helps you understand what it means to repent? What additional insights do you find in\nEzekiel 36:26–27\nand\nAlma 7:14–16\n?\nEzekiel 37\nThe Lord is gathering His people and giving them new life.\nThe gathering of Israel is portrayed in\nEzekiel 37\nthrough two symbols. As you read about the first one—dead bones being restored to life (see\nverses 1–14\n)—ponder what it suggests to you about gathering Israel on both sides of the veil (see also\nEzekiel 36:24–30\n). Consider questions like these:\nWhat is the Lord trying to accomplish through the gathering of Israel?\nHow is He accomplishing it?\nYou could ask yourself these same questions as you read about the second symbol, in\nverses 15–28\n. This symbol involves two sticks, which many scholars interpret as wooden writing boards joined by a hinge. The stick of Judah can represent the Bible (since much of the Bible was written by Judah’s descendants), and the stick of Joseph can represent the Book of Mormon (since Lehi’s family were descendants of Joseph of Egypt). With that in mind, what do these verses teach you about the role of the scriptures in the gathering of Israel?\nThink about how the Bible and Book of Mormon have worked together in your life—in particular, to help you come to Christ. What passages have been especially meaningful to you?\nSee also\n2 Nephi 3:11–13\n;\n29:14\n; “\nIsrael, Israel, God Is Calling\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 7; Topics and Questions, “\nBible\n,” “\nBook of Mormon\n,” Gospel Library; “The Book of Mormon Gathers Scattered Israel” (video), Gospel Library.\n1:31\nThe Book of Mormon Gathers Scattered Israel\nIn a vision, Ezekiel saw a river flow from the temple and heal the Dead Sea.\nEzekiel 47:1–12\nI can find spiritual healing in the house of the Lord.\nAs you read\nEzekiel 47:1–12\n, it might help to know that the Dead Sea is so salty that fish and plants can’t live in it. What impresses you about the waters described in\nverses 1–12\n? (see also\nRevelation 22:1\n). What might these waters symbolize? What could the trees described in\nverse 12\nrepresent?\nWhat does Elder Dale G. Renlund’s message “\nFamily History and Temple Work: Sealing and Healing\n” add to your understanding? (see\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 47–48). Ponder how you have found spiritual life and healing because of the temple.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nEzekiel 3:17\n;\n33:1–5\nProphets are like watchmen who warn us of danger.\nYoung children might enjoy doing actions that go with\nEzekiel 3:17\n. For example, they could point to their eyes, ears, and mouth when you read the words “watchman,” “hear,” and “mouth.” They might also like going on a hike—outdoors or just around the room. As they walk, warn them about things on the trail, like rivers to jump over, branches to duck under, or animals to avoid (real or pretend). This could lead to a conversation about how the Lord’s prophet warns us of dangers we cannot see.\nHere’s another way to illustrate\nEzekiel 3:17\n;\n33:1–5\n. One of your children could pretend to be a “watchman” by looking out a window and telling everyone else what is happening outside. You could also watch the video “Watchman on the Tower” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). How is our living prophet like a watchman for us?\n4:17\nWatchman on the Tower\nThe Prophet Ezekiel\n, by Lyle Beddes\nEzekiel 37:15–23\nThe Bible and the Book of Mormon help “gather” us to Jesus Christ.\nAfter reading\nEzekiel 37:15–23\ntogether, you and your children could find two sticks and write on one\nFor Judah (Bible)\nand on the other\nFor Joseph (Book of Mormon)\n. You could then share stories or scriptures from the Bible and Book of Mormon that help you feel closer to the Savior and become “[His] people” (\nverse 23\n). Why is it good to have both of these two books of scripture?\nDon’t try to cover everything.\nYou may not be able to explore every truth in Ezekiel with your children. Prayerfully consider what they need to understand, and seek spiritual guidance to determine what to focus on. (See\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n17\n.)\nEzekiel 47:1–12\nOur hearts and families can find healing in the house of the Lord.\nEzekiel 47\ndescribes Ezekiel’s vision of water flowing from the temple and healing the Dead Sea—a sea so salty that fish and plants cannot live in it. Maybe your children could each draw one or two objects from the vision, like a temple, a river, a desert, the Dead Sea, a multitude of fish, or a fruitful tree. Then, as you read\nverses 1–12\ntogether, they could share their drawing when that object is mentioned. What blessings came from the river in this vision? Help the children see how these blessings are like the blessings the Savior offers those who keep temple covenants. The video “And the River Will Grow” (Gospel Library) can help.\n3:43\nAnd the River Will Grow\nYou could also sing together a song that describes temple blessings, such as “\nFamilies Can Be Together Forever\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 188). What does this song teach about how the Lord blesses us in His holy house?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Most likely no one will threaten to throw you into a fiery furnace or a den of lions because of your faith in Jesus Christ. But none of us get through this life without a trial of faith. So we can all benefit from the examples of people like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who were taken captive as young men by the mighty Babylonian Empire (see\n2 Kings 24:10–16\n). Surrounded by an unfamiliar culture with different values, they faced great temptations to abandon their beliefs and righteous traditions. Yet they remained true to their covenants. How did they do it? By doing those small and simple things God asks of all of us—praying, fasting, choosing good friends, trusting in Him, and being a light to others. Like Joseph in Egypt and Esther in Persia, Daniel and his friends in Babylon kept their faith in God, and God worked miracles that still inspire believers to this day.\nFor an overview of the book of Daniel, see “\nDaniel\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDaniel 1\n;\n3\n;\n6\nI can trust in the Lord when my faith is tried.\nIn a sense, we all live in Babylon. We often face temptations to compromise our standards and turn away from faith in Christ. As you read\nDaniel 1\n,\n3\n, and\n6\n, note the ways in which Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were pressured to do things they knew were wrong. How did they respond to these situations? (see\nDaniel 1:10–13\n;\n3:15–18\n;\n6:10\n). What were the results of their faith? What do you learn from these experiences that can help you trust in the Lord when you face opposition? Also consider the following questions:\nWhen have you felt pressured to do something you knew was wrong? How has the Lord blessed you for keeping His commandments?\nWhat if your faith doesn’t lead to the miracles you seek? (for an example, see\nAlma 14:8–13\n). Based on what you read in\nDaniel 3:13–18\n, how do you think Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego would have answered this question? How can their example affect how you approach your trials?\nHow can your righteous choices lead others to greater faith in the Lord? (see\nDaniel 2:47\n;\n3:28–29\n). Ponder the effects that your choices may be having on others.\nSee also Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “\nBe Not Afraid, Only Believe\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2015, 76–79.\nTry to involve everyone.\nThe Savior “inviteth … all to come unto him and partake of his goodness” (\n2 Nephi 26:33\n). If you are teaching your family or a class, ponder ways you can give everyone an opportunity to participate in some way. For example, you could give each person a passage of scripture, a section of a conference message, or a verse from a hymn to ponder and comment on. Don’t pressure anyone to participate, but give them opportunities.\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the Fiery Furnace\n, by William Maughan\nDaniel 2\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the kingdom of God on earth.\nThrough revelation, Daniel saw that Nebuchadnezzar’s dream foretold future worldly kingdoms, as well as the future kingdom of God, which “shall never be destroyed” (\nDaniel 2:44\n). “The Church is that prophesied latter-day kingdom,” Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught, “not created by man but set up by the God of heaven and rolling forth as a stone ‘cut out of the mountain without hands’ to fill the earth” (“\nWhy the Church\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2015, 111). Think about God’s latter-day kingdom as you read the descriptions of the stone in\nDaniel 2:34–35, 44–45\n. What is your role in helping this prophecy come to pass?\nSee also “\nHark, All Ye Nations!\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 264; “God Gave Them Knowledge” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\n13:49\nGod Gave Them Knowledge\nDaniel 2:1–30\nReceiving revelation requires spiritual preparation.\nAs you review\nDaniel 2:1–15\n, consider how you would feel if you found yourself in Daniel’s position. What did Daniel do? (see\nDaniel 2:16–18\n). What can you learn from\nDaniel 1:17\nabout how God prepared Daniel? What can you learn from Daniel’s words and actions after he received the Lord’s help? (see\nDaniel 2:19–30\n).\nDaniel 7:13–14\nJesus Christ is the Son of the Eternal Father.\nDuring the Savior’s earthly ministry, many Jews considered the title “Son of man” from\nDaniel 7:13\nto refer to the coming Messiah. What do you learn about the Messiah from\nDaniel 7:13–14\n? (see also\nMoses 6:57\n).\nThe Savior often referred to himself as “the Son of man.” Consider reviewing some examples:\nMatthew 25:31\n;\nMark 9:31\n;\n10:45\n. What is He teaching about Himself in these verses? In\nMark 14:61–64\n, Jesus used this title on the last day of His mortal life. Note the reaction from the people who heard His declaration. How does Daniel’s prophecy about the Son of Man affect your feelings about what happened to Him in\nMark 15\n?\nJust as Jesus was hated for declaring that He was “the Son of man,” you might also face persecution for declaring the truth. Compare the prophecy in\nDaniel 7:13–14\nwith the promises in\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:29, 46\n.\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 49:6\n; Guide to the Scriptures, “\nSon of Man\n,” Gospel Library.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDaniel 1\n;\n3\n;\n6\nJesus will help me do what is right even when it’s hard.\nTo help your children learn from the inspiring stories in the book of Daniel, you could find pictures of the events in\nDaniel 1\n,\n3\n, and\n6\n(see this week’s activity page or the\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 23\n,\n25\n,\n26\n). Then you could place the pictures face down and invite a child to turn one over and talk about the story it represents. (For help, see “\nDaniel and His Friends\n,” “\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego\n,” and “\nDaniel and the Lions’ Den\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 154–56, 160–62, 163–65.)\n1:39\nDaniel and His Friends\n1:39\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego\n1:45\nDaniel and the Lions’ Den\nHelp your children think of situations when they might be pressured to make a wrong choice, like Daniel and his friends were in\nDaniel 1\n,\n3\n, and\n6\n. Share with each other how you have been blessed for making the right choice even when it was hard. You could also sing together a song related to this topic, such as “\nChoose the Right\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 239).\nTrusting the Wisdom of the Word\nDaniel 1:1–17\nHeavenly Father wants me to take care of my body.\nReading the story about Daniel and his friends refusing the king’s meat and wine may inspire a conversation about the law of health Heavenly Father has given us today (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 89\n). Maybe you could look for the blessings Daniel and his friends received and compare them to the blessings promised in the Word of Wisdom (see\nDaniel 1:15–17\nand\nDoctrine and Covenants 89:18–21\n).\nDaniel 2\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the kingdom of God on earth.\nAs you read\nDaniel 2:31–35, 44–45\nwith your children, you could invite them to draw a picture of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. Help them understand the stone in the dream represents The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. What do we learn about the Church from this dream? Your children could name some things Heavenly Father did to set up His Church in the latter days. If they need help, you could show pictures of events from the Restoration of the Church (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 90–95\n).\nDaniel 6\nHeavenly Father wants me to pray often.\nWhy was praying to Heavenly Father so important to Daniel? Perhaps you and your children could talk about that question as you read\nDaniel 6\ntogether. Then you could tell each other why praying is important to you. Your children might enjoy drawing pictures of themselves praying in various situations. They could use their drawings to teach each other that we can pray to Heavenly Father no matter where we are or what we need.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Israel’s covenant with the Lord was meant to be so deep and meaningful that the Lord compared it to a marriage. The covenant, like a marriage, included eternal commitment, shared experiences, building a life together, exclusive loyalty, and, most of all, wholehearted love. Sadly, the Israelites were not faithful to their covenant. And yet the Lord’s message to them was not “I will reject you forever.” Instead it was “I will invite you back” (see\nHosea 2:14–15\n). “I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness,” He declared through the prophet Hosea (\nHosea 2:19\n). “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely” (\nHosea 14:4\n). This is the same message He gives us today as we seek to live our covenants with love and devotion.\nJoel shared a similar message: “Turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness” (\nJoel 2:13\n). Reading these prophets’ words may prompt you to ponder your own relationship with the Lord—to think about how His faithfulness to you inspires you to be faithful to Him.\nFor an overview of the books of Hosea and Joel, see “\nHosea, or Hoshea\n” and “\nJoel\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nHosea 1–3\n;\n14\nThe Lord always invites me to return to Him.\nHosea’s wife, Gomer, was unfaithful to him, and God pointed to this sad event to teach the Israelites how He felt about them and their covenants with Him. As you read\nHosea 1–3\n, ponder how the Lord views His relationship with His covenant people. How is making a covenant with the Lord like entering into a marriage? How is failing to keep that covenant like being unfaithful to a spouse? (see\nHosea 2:5–7, 13\n). What does\nHosea 2:14–23\nteach you about the Lord’s love and mercy? How do you show Him your love and loyalty?\nIn\nHosea 14\n, look for the many beautiful promises the Lord makes to those who return to Him. What does the phrase “love them freely” mean to you? (\nverse 4\n). What do the plant metaphors in\nverses 5–8\nteach you about the Lord’s blessings, including the blessings of repentance? As part of your study, consider singing or listening to a hymn about the Savior’s mercy, such as “\nCome unto Jesus\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 117).\nGomer, who represents the house of Israel and their broken covenants, was offered redemption by the Lord. Illustration by Deb Minnard, licensed from\ngoodsalt.com\nHosea 6:4–7\n;\nJoel 2:12–13\nDevotion to God must be felt inwardly, not just expressed outwardly.\nThe people in Hosea’s day were offering animal sacrifices, but they were breaking more important commandments. What do you think it means that the Lord “desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings”? (\nHosea 6:6\n). What do you think it means for righteousness to be like a cloud or like dew? (see\nHosea 6:4\n). What should our righteousness be like? (see\nIsaiah 48:18\n;\n1 Nephi 2:9–10\n).\nYou could also read\nMatthew 9:10–13\n;\n12:1–8\nto see how the Savior used\nHosea 6:6\nduring His ministry. How do these passages help you understand Hosea’s words?\nWhen reading\nJoel 2:12–13\n, it might help to know that rending or tearing one’s clothing was an outward sign of mourning or remorse. How is rending our hearts different from rending our garments?\nJoel 2\n“I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh.”\nWhat similarities do you see between our day and the day Joel foresaw? (see especially\nJoel 2:1–2, 11, 18–32\n). What impresses you about the blessings the Lord promised in\nverses 18–32\n? Why might these blessings be especially valuable today?\nIt might be interesting to read what Moroni said about\nJoel 2\nwhen he visited Joseph Smith in 1823 (see\nJoseph Smith—History 1:41\n). How do you feel the prophecies in\nJoel 2:28–32\nare being fulfilled in our day? (see also\nActs 2:1–21\n). What do you think it means that the Lord would “pour out [His] spirit upon all flesh”? (\nJoel 2:28\n).\nYou might ponder these words from President Russell M. Nelson: “In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost” (“\nRevelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 96). Why is revelation essential to your spiritual survival?\nWhat can you do if you feel like you aren’t receiving that outpouring? Here are some examples that might help. What did the people in these scriptures do to receive an outpouring of the Lord’s Spirit?\nMosiah 4:1–3, 19–20\n;\n18:7–11\nHelaman 6:34–36\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:37–41\nAs you read these words from Elder David A. Bednar, ponder what it means to you to feel an outpouring of the Holy Ghost in your daily life:\n“We often make it hard on ourselves to receive personal revelation. By that I mean the covenant promise is that as we honor our covenants, we may always have the Holy Ghost to be our constant companion. But we talk about it and we treat it as if hearing the voice of the Lord through His Spirit is the rare event. … [The Spirit] ought to be with us all of the time. Not every nanosecond, but if a person is doing his or her best—you don’t have to be perfect—but if you and I are doing our best and we’re not committing serious transgression, then we can count on the Holy Ghost guiding us. …\n“… We seem to believe that the Holy Ghost is dramatic and big and sudden, when it’s still and small and incremental over time” (“\nElder David A. Bednar Discussion\n” [evening with a General Authority, Feb. 7, 2020], broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nSee also Gary E. Stevenson, “\nPromptings of the Spirit\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 42–45; “Enemy Territory” (video), Gospel Library.\n3:38\nEnemy Territory\nCreate a spiritual environment.\n“What have you observed that contributes to a spiritual environment for learning the gospel? What detracts from it? … Think about the setting where you most often teach [or learn]. How do you feel when you are there? How can you more effectively invite the Spirit to be present there?” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n7\n).\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nHosea 2:19–20\nI can faithfully keep my covenants.\nIn the book of Hosea, the Lord compared His covenants with His people to a marriage. To learn from this comparison, you and your children could look at a picture of a bride and groom and talk about how Heavenly Father wants a husband and wife to treat each other. Help your children find words in\nHosea 2:19–20\nthat describe how the Lord feels about us. How can we show the Lord that we love Him and will be faithful to Him?\nHosea 10:12\n“It is time to seek the Lord.”\nHosea 10:12\nrefers to sowing, reaping, time, and rain to invite us to seek the Lord. As you read this verse, what creative ideas come to mind that could inspire the children to seek Him? For example, maybe your children could draw a clock and write down ways they can seek the Lord at different times throughout the day. A song like “Anytime, Anywhere” (Gospel Library) could help you teach that it is always a good time to seek the Lord.\nOr your children could do simple actions that go with the verse, such as pretending to plant seeds, pick vegetables, or stand in the rain. Help your children compare planting a seed and reaping good food to living righteously and receiving the Lord’s blessings. Then you could tell each other about the blessings the Lord has rained upon you as you have tried to seek Him.\nHosea 13:4, 14\nJesus Christ is my Savior and Redeemer.\nTo emphasize the truth in\nHosea 13:4\nthat there is no Savior except Jesus Christ, you could show your children pictures of several people, including Jesus. Your children could take turns pointing to the person who has the power to save us from sin and death. Share your testimony of Jesus Christ and His Atonement.\nYour children could look for words in\nHosea 13:4, 14\nthat describe Jesus Christ. What do these words teach us about Him? Consider helping your children use the\nGuide to the Scriptures\nto find other scriptures that teach that Jesus is our Savior and Redeemer. Share with each other how you feel about Jesus Christ.\nJoel 2:28–29\nThe Holy Ghost can guide me.\nMaybe you could help your children understand\nJoel 2:28–29\nby letting them pour a liquid and then contrasting it with a drip or a trickle. What could it mean for the Spirit to be “poured out” upon us?\nAs you read\nJoel 2:28–29\ntogether, you might invite your children to insert each other’s names in place of the phrases “your sons” and “your daughters.” Then help them search scriptures like\nJohn 14:16\n;\nMoroni 10:5\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:17\nto find out how the Spirit can help them.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Jonah was on a ship headed for Tarshish. There’s nothing wrong with sailing to Tarshish, except that it is far away from Nineveh, where Jonah was supposed to go to deliver God’s message. When the ship encountered a great storm, Jonah knew it was because of his disobedience. At Jonah’s insistence, his fellow mariners cast him into the depths of the sea to stop the storm. It looked like the end of Jonah and his ministry. But the Lord hadn’t given up on Jonah—just as He hadn’t given up on the people of Nineveh, on the house of Israel, or on any of us.\nSo He keeps sending prophets—like Jonah, Amos, Obadiah, and our prophets today—with the message that if we repent, we will not be cast off forever. Of all the “secrets” God reveals (see\nAmos 3:7\n), this one is among the most precious: that because of Jesus Christ, it’s not too late to change. He still wants to help us live up to the covenants we made with Him, and He’s willing to offer us another chance.\nFor more about these books, see “\nAmos\n,” “\nObadiah\n,” and “\nJonah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAmos 3:1–8\n;\n7:10–15\nThe Lord reveals truth through His prophets.\nIn\nAmos 3:3–6\n, the prophet Amos presented examples of conclusions we can draw from signs we hear or see: when a lion roars, it must have captured prey; if a bird is caught in a trap, there must have been bait there. In\nverses 7–8\n, Amos applied this logic to prophets. What conclusions can we draw when a prophet prophesies? What else do you learn about prophets from\nAmos 7:10–15\n?\nWhat has the Lord revealed to you through His prophets?\nElder Ulisses Soares said that “having prophets is a sign of God’s love” (“\nProphets Speak by the Power of the Holy Spirit\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 99). Consider how you would complete this sentence: “I know God loves me, because He sends prophets who …” Here are some scriptures that can help:\nDeuteronomy 18:18\n;\nEzekiel 3:16–17\n;\nEphesians 4:11–14\n;\n1 Nephi 22:2\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 21:4–6\n;\n84:36–38\n;\n107:91–92\n.\nWhat would you say to someone who feels prophets are not needed today?\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nProphets,\n” Gospel Library.\nAmos 4–5\n“Seek the Lord, and ye shall live.”\nAccording to\nAmos 4:6–13\n, what had the Lord hoped would happen after the Israelites experienced trials? (see also\nHelaman 12:3\n). While your trials may not have been sent by God, how have they given you opportunities to turn to Him?\nAs you read\nAmos 5:4, 14–15\n, ponder how the Lord has been gracious to you. How has seeking Him brought you life?\nAmos 8:11–12\nThe word of the Lord can satisfy spiritual hunger and thirst.\nAs you read\nAmos 8:11–12\n, think about why famine is a good comparison for living without God’s word (see also\nJohn 6:26–35\n;\n2 Nephi 9:50–51\n;\n32:3\n;\nEnos 1:4–8\n). How do you know when you are spiritually hungry?\nThese verses could also apply to the Great Apostasy (see Topics and Questions, “\nApostasy\n,” Gospel Library). How has that spiritual “famine” affected God’s children? How has the Restoration satisfied your spiritual hunger?\nSee also “The Great Apostasy” (video), Gospel Library.\n16:36\nThe Great Apostasy\nObadiah 1:21\nWho are the “saviours … on mount Zion”?\nReferring to\nObadiah 1:21\n, President Gordon B. Hinckley explained that we become saviors on Mount Zion when we receive ordinances for the dead in the temple (see “\nClosing Remarks\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2004, 105). How is doing that work similar—if only in a small way—to what the Savior did for us? How has doing this work helped you feel closer to the Savior?\nSee also “\nHoly Temples on Mount Zion\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 289.\nJonah 1–4\nThe Lord is merciful to all who turn to Him.\nNineveh was an enemy of Israel known for its violence and cruelty. To Jonah, it seemed unrealistic that they were ready to repent. It might be interesting to compare Jonah’s attitude (see\nJonah 1\n;\n3–4\n) to the feelings of Alma and the sons of Mosiah (see\nMosiah 28:1–5\n;\nAlma 17:23–25\n). What do you learn from\nJonah 3\nthat inspires you to share the gospel even with people who may not seem ready to change?\nAs you read Jonah, look for examples of the Lord’s mercy. Why do you feel Jonah was “displeased” and “very angry” (\nJonah 4:1\n) when the Lord extended mercy to the people of Nineveh? What do you feel the Lord was trying to teach him in\nchapter 4\n? Ponder how you have experienced His mercy in your life. What do you learn from Jonah that can help you be more merciful?\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nAmos 3:7\nProphets are messengers of Jesus Christ.\nTo help your children understand\nAmos 3:7\n, you could whisper a simple message to one of them and ask them to share the message with the other children. How is the messenger in this activity like a prophet? Why does the Lord give us prophets?\nTo learn more about what prophets do, you and your children could review\nrecent messages from the current President of the Church\n. You could also sing a song like “\nFollow the Prophet\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 110–11). Share with each other why you choose to follow God’s prophet.\nHelp children memorize scriptures.\nElder Richard G. Scott shared: “To memorize a scripture is to forge a new friendship. It is like discovering a new individual who can help in time of need, give inspiration and comfort, and be a source of motivation for needed change” (“\nThe Power of Scripture\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 2011, 6). To help your children memorize all or part of\nAmos 3:7\n, you could write it down and repeat it together. Then you could erase or cover a few words at a time until your children can repeat the entire verse from memory.\nAmos 8:11–12\nThe Restoration of the gospel ended the famine of apostasy.\nInvite your children to pretend to be hungry as you read\nAmos 8:11–12\n. What does it feel like when we are hungry for God’s word? Maybe your children could pretend to eat as you share with each other some of your favorite scriptures.\nYou could use Guide to the Scriptures, “\nApostasy\n” (Gospel Library), or “\nAfter the New Testament\n” (in\nNew Testament Stories\n, 167–70) to help your children understand the “famine” that came from the Great Apostasy and how it ended with the Restoration. Share with each other reasons you are grateful that the Lord restored His gospel in our day.\n2:52\nAfter the New Testament\nJonah 1–3\nThe Lord will help me obey Him, even when it’s hard.\nTo help your children learn the story of Jonah, you could review “\nJonah the Prophet\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n; see also this week’s activity page). You could then ask:\nWhat happened when Jonah didn’t obey the Lord? (see\nJonah 1:4–17\n).\nWhat did Jonah do to repent? (see\nJonah 1:10–12\n;\n2:1–4, 9\n;\n3:1–4\n).\nWhat happened when Jonah did obey? (see\nJonah 3:5\n).\n2:30\nJonah the Prophet\nYour children might enjoy retelling the story of Jonah or acting it out. Share with each other some experiences when the Lord wanted you to do something that was hard for you. How did He help you obey Him?\nJonah 1–4\nThe Lord is merciful to all who turn to Him.\nMaybe your children could pretend they are interviewing Jonah about his experience. What questions would they ask him? Encourage them to ask questions to find out what Jonah learned about the Lord. What might Jonah say, for example, about the Lord’s mercy? (see, for example,\nJonah 2:7–10\n;\n3:10\n;\n4:2\n).\nChrist and the Palsied Man\n, by J. Kirk Richards\nHelp your children think of examples when the Savior showed mercy to others, such as\nMark 2:3–12\n;\nLuke 23:33–34\n; and\nJohn 8:1–11\n. You and your children could search for pictures of these examples. What opportunities do we have to be merciful to others?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "title": "Micah;Nahum;Habakkuk;Zephaniah",
        "content": "Reading the Old Testament often means reading prophecies about destruction. The Lord frequently called prophets to warn the wicked about His judgments. The ministries of Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah are good examples. In dreadful detail, these prophets foretold the downfall of cities that, at the time, seemed strong and powerful: Nineveh, Babylon, and Jerusalem. But that was thousands of years ago. Why is it valuable to read these prophecies today?\nEven though those prideful, wicked cities were destroyed, prideful wickedness persists. We may even detect traces of it in our own hearts. Old Testament prophets reveal how we can turn away from these evils. Perhaps that’s one reason we still read their words today. They weren’t just prophets of doom—they were prophets of deliverance. The descriptions of destruction are tempered by invitations to come unto Christ and receive His forgiveness. As Micah put it, the Lord does not delight in condemning us, but “he delighteth in mercy” (\nMicah 7:18\n). This was the Lord’s way anciently, and it is His way today. “His ways are everlasting” (\nHabakkuk 3:6\n).\nFor overviews of these books, see “\nMicah\n,” “\nNahum\n,” “\nHabakkuk\n,” and “\nZephaniah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMicah 6:1–8\n“What doth the Lord require of thee?”\nMicah invites us to imagine what it might be like to “come before the Lord, and bow … before the high God” (\nMicah 6:6\n). What do\nverses 6–8\nsuggest to you about what is important to the Lord as He evaluates your life?\nSee also Dale G. Renlund, “\nDo Justly, Love Mercy, and Walk Humbly with God\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 109–12.\n“The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble” (\nNahum 1:7\n).\nNahum 1\nThe Lord is both powerful and merciful.\nNahum’s mission was to foretell the destruction of Nineveh—the capital of the violent empire Assyria, which had scattered Israel and brutalized Judah. Nahum began by describing God’s wrath and matchless power, but He also spoke about God’s mercy and goodness. Look for verses in\nchapter 1\nthat help you understand each of these attributes—and other attributes of God that you notice. Why do you think it is important to know each of these things about the Lord?\nHabakkuk\nI can trust the Lord’s will and His timing.\nEven prophets sometimes have questions about the Lord’s ways. Habakkuk, who lived at a time of widespread wickedness in Judah, began his record with questions to the Lord (see\nHabakkuk 1:1–4\n). How would you summarize Habakkuk’s concerns? What similar questions do people ask about God today? Have you ever had similar feelings? You could also compare his questions with others in the scriptures, such as those found in\nMark 4:37–38\nand\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:1–6\n.\nThe Lord responded to Habakkuk’s questions by saying that He would send the Chaldeans (the Babylonians) to punish Judah (see\nHabakkuk 1:5–11\n). But Habakkuk was still troubled, for it seemed unfair for the Lord to stand by “when the wicked [Babylon] devoureth the man that is more righteous [Judah]” (see\nverses 12–17\n). What do you find in\nHabakkuk 2:1–4\nthat inspires you to trust the Lord when you have unanswered questions? (see also\nMark 4:39–40\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:7–8\n; “God Will Lift Us Up” [video], Gospel Library).\n4:59\nGod Will Lift Us Up\nChapter 3\nis Habakkuk’s prayer of praise and faith. How is Habakkuk’s tone in\nchapter 3\ndifferent from\nchapter 1\n? Here’s an idea to help you ponder\nverses 17–19\n: Make a list of temporal and spiritual blessings God has given you. Then imagine that you lost the temporal blessings. How might that make you feel about the other blessings? Why might it be hard to “rejoice in the Lord” (\nverse 18\n) during hardships like those described in\nverse 17\n? Ponder how you can develop greater faith in God, even when life seems unfair.\nSee also Gerrit W. Gong, “\nAll Things for Our Good\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 41–44; “\nLead, Kindly Light\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 97; Topics and Questions, “\nSeeking Answers to Questions\n,” Gospel Library.\nBe patient.\nSometimes we want answers to our questions right away, but spiritual insights take time and cannot be forced. As the Lord told Habakkuk, “Wait for it; because it will surely come” (\nHabakkuk 2:3\n).\nZephaniah\n“Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth.”\nAs you read Zephaniah’s prophecies, notice the attitudes and behaviors that led to destruction—see especially\nZephaniah 1:4–6, 12\n;\n2:8, 10, 15\n;\n3:1–4\n. Then look for the characteristics of the people God would preserve—see\nZephaniah 2:1–3\n;\n3:12–13, 18–19\n. What message do you feel the Lord has for you in these verses?\nZephaniah 3:14–20\nThe Lord will rejoice with His people in Zion.\nAfter reading\nZephaniah 3:14–20\n, see how many ways you can complete this sentence:\n“Be glad and rejoice with all the heart” because …\nWhy is it important to you to know about these reasons to rejoice? You might compare these verses to the experiences described in\n3 Nephi 17\nand ponder how Jesus Christ feels about His people—including you.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nMicah 5:2\nJesus Christ was born in Bethlehem.\nYour children may not know that it was a prophecy by Micah that helped the Wise Men find the baby Jesus in Bethlehem. Using\nMicah 5:2\nand\nMatthew 2:1–6\n, perhaps your children could reenact their experience. Then you could talk about why Jesus’s birth was so important that prophets knew about it many years before He was born.\nThe Holy Child Is Born\n, by Dana Wood\nNahum 1:7\n“The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble.”\nAfter reading\nNahum 1:7\n, your children could build or draw a simple “strong hold” or fortress (there’s a picture of one in this outline). What are some reasons people might need a fortress? What makes our day a “day of trouble”? How is Jesus Christ like a stronghold for us?\nHabakkuk 2:3\nGod will always fulfill His promises.\nTo introduce\nHabakkuk 2:3\n, you and your children could talk about things that are good but only after we wait—like fruit that needs to ripen or dough that needs to bake. What would happen if we tried to eat the fruit or the dough before it was ready? Then you could talk about the prophet Habakkuk, who wanted to know when the Lord would stop the wickedness in the world. Read the Lord’s answer in\nHabakkuk 2:3\n. You could help your children think of things that God has promised. With each example, you could say together, “Wait for it; because it will surely come.”\nHabakkuk 2:14\nI can help fill the earth with knowledge of Jesus Christ.\nTo illustrate\nHabakkuk 2:14\n, you and your children could fill a jar or other container with pictures or words representing things Jesus did or taught. How can we help fill the world with knowledge of the Lord?\nYou could also show your children a map of the world (see Church History Maps, no. 7, “\nMap of the World\n”). Help them find the place where they live and places where missionaries they know have served. You could sing together a song about sharing the gospel, such as “\nWe’ll Bring the World His Truth\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 172–73). What can we tell others about Jesus Christ?\nZephaniah 3:14–20\nJesus Christ rejoices with those who follow Him.\nIn\nZephaniah 3:14–20\n, your children could look for something that makes them want to “sing, … be glad and rejoice with all the heart.” Perhaps you could sing some joyful hymns or songs together and talk about the joy you find in the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "After decades of captivity, a group of Israelites, probably including the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, were allowed to return to Jerusalem. Some in this group remembered what the temple looked like before it was destroyed. To those who wondered whether it would ever again resemble the Lord’s “house in her first glory” (\nHaggai 2:3\n), Haggai spoke the Lord’s words of encouragement: “Be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, … fear ye not.” “I will fill this house with glory, … and in this place will I give peace” (\nHaggai 2:4–5, 7, 9\n).\nBut it wasn’t just the holy temple that needed rebuilding. In many ways, God’s people were spiritually in ruins. And rebuilding a holy people takes more than cutting stones and positioning them to build a holy house. It means the inscription “Holiness unto the Lord” must be engraved not just on a temple wall, or even on “the bells of the horses” and “every pot in Jerusalem” (\nZechariah 14:20–21\n). They must also be engraved on every heart.\nFor an overview of the books of Haggai and Zechariah, see “\nHaggai\n” and “\nZechariah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nHaggai 1\n;\n2:1–9\n“Consider your ways.”\nThere were many important things to do to rebuild Jerusalem. But after roughly 15 years had passed since the Israelites’ return, the Lord was displeased that the rebuilding of the temple had not been given higher priority (see\nHaggai 1:2–5\n; see also\nEzra 4:24\n). As you read\nHaggai 1\n;\n2:1–9\n, consider questions like these:\nWhat consequences did the Israelites face because they had not finished the temple?\nWhat blessings did the Lord promise them if they finished building His house?\nWhat is the Lord’s message to you in\nHaggai 1:5–7\n? How could you align your priorities with the Lord’s? When have you been blessed for putting God first in your life?\nThe early Latter-day Saints faced a similar situation to the Israelites in Haggai’s day (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 95\n). What do you learn from these two examples about the Lord’s feelings about temples?\nSee also Dale G. Renlund, “\nJesus Christ Is the Treasure\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 96–99; Terence M. Vinson, “\nTrue Disciples of the Savior\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 9–11; “\nWe Love Thy House, O God\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 247; “Provo City Center Temple Completed” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\n7:17\nProvo City Center Temple Completed\nZechariah 1–3\n;\n7–8\n;\n14\nThe Lord can make me holy.\nIn your opinion, what’s the value of having “holiness unto the Lord” engraved on everyday objects like those mentioned in\nZechariah 14:20\n? (see also\nExodus 28:36–38\n). What’s the value of having it engraved on temples today? What does this phrase mean to you? How can you make holiness part of your daily life? Ponder these questions as you read the Lord’s invitations to His people to become more holy in\nZechariah 1:1–6\n;\n3:1–7\n;\n7:8–10\n;\n8:16–17\n.\nYou could also read\nZechariah 2:10–11\n;\n8:1–8\n;\n14:9–11, 20–21\nto learn what life will be like in a future day when we all dwell with the Lord in a state of holiness. What impresses you about Zechariah’s vision of the future of Jerusalem? What do you find here that you would like to see in your community? How can you prepare to live in the conditions Zechariah described?\n“Behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass” (\nZechariah 9:9\n).\nTriumphal Entry\n, by Harry Anderson\nZechariah 9:9–11\n;\n11:12–13\n;\n12:10\n;\n13:6–7\n;\n14:1–9\nJesus Christ is the promised Messiah.\nSeveral of Zechariah’s writings point both to the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ and to His eventual Second Coming. Below are some of Zechariah’s prophecies, along with scriptures about their fulfillment. As you study these passages, ask yourself: What does this teach me about the Savior?\nZechariah 9:9–11\n(see\nMatthew 21:1–11\n;\n1 Peter 3:18–19\n)\nZechariah 11:12–13\n(see\nMatthew 26:14–16\n;\n27:1–7\n)\nZechariah 12:10\n(see\nJohn 19:37\n;\nRevelation 1:7\n)\nZechariah 13:6–7\n;\n14:1–9\n(see\nMatthew 26:31\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:47–53\n)\nWhat do you think it would have been like to be among the people welcoming Jesus into Jerusalem as described in\nZechariah 9:9–11\n? How can you welcome Him into your life, your homes, and your community?\nSee also Guide to the Scriptures, “\nMessiah\n,” Gospel Library; “The Lord’s Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem” (video), Gospel Library; Ronald A. Rasband, “\nHosanna to the Most High God\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 108–12.\n1:22\nThe Lord's Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nHaggai 1:2–8\n“Consider your ways.”\nAs you read parts of\nHaggai 1:2–5\nwith your children, help them find out why the Lord was not pleased with the people. Perhaps your children could pick a phrase from\nverse 6\nand draw a picture of it. They could show it to each other and guess what phrase each drawing represents. When we spend time on things other than what the Lord wants, how is that like eating but not being filled? You might talk with each other about how you can make time for the things that are important to the Lord.\nYou could also read\nverse 8\nto your children and invite them to pretend to “go up to the mountain,” “bring wood,” and “build the house [of the Lord].” Your children could make a list of things they do in a typical day, including things the Lord has asked them to do. Ask your children to “consider [their] ways” by circling what the Lord might say are the most important things on their list.\nHome-centered teaching.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson has taught that the home should be the “center of gospel learning” (“\nBecoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 113). As your family studies Haggai’s counsel to “consider your ways,” you could talk about how to put God first in your family life.\nZechariah 3:1–7\nMaking and keeping covenants can help me be more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nIn a vision, Zechariah saw a high priest who was “clothed with filthy garments” (\nZechariah 3:3\n). An angel gave him clean clothing. You could help your children discover important truths by reading together\nZechariah 3:1–7\nand talking about what the dirty clothing and clean clothing might represent. How do we become clean from our sins, even after we are baptized? How does our baptismal covenant help us “walk in [the Lord’s] ways”?\nYou and your children could look at a picture of a baptism, like the one in this outline. Why do we wear white at our baptism? You could also sing a song about baptism, such as “\nWhen I Am Baptized\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 103); what does the song teach about why the Lord wants us to be baptized?\nZechariah 9:9–11\n;\n11:12\n;\n13:6–7\nJesus Christ is the promised Messiah.\nYour children might like to visualize the event foretold in\nZechariah 9:9\n, when Jesus came into Jerusalem during the last week of His mortal life. To help with this, show them a picture of the event, like the one in this outline. You could also share with them “\nThe Savior Goes to Jerusalem\n” (in\nNew Testament Stories\n, 110–12). Your children could point to people in the pictures who are “rejoicing greatly.” Who is the King in\nZechariah 9:9\n? Why are we thankful for Him?\n1:35\nChapter 44: The Savior Goes to Jerusalem\nConsider helping your children compare prophecies from Zechariah with the New Testament verses describing their fulfillment. Here are some examples:\nZechariah 9:9\nand\nMatthew 21:5–9\n;\nZechariah 9:11\nand\n1 Peter 3:18–19\n;\nZechariah 11:12\nand\nMatthew 26:14–16\n;\nZechariah 13:7\nand\nMatthew 26:31\n. What do we learn about the Savior from these verses?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "“I have loved you,” the Lord told His people through the prophet Malachi. But the Israelites, who had suffered generations of affliction and captivity, asked, “Wherein hast thou loved us?” (\nMalachi 1:2\n). After all Israel had been through, they may have wondered whether their history is really a story of God’s love for His covenant people. In some ways, it’s easier to see it as a story of human weakness and rebellion. Yet through it all, God never stopped reaching out in love. When the sons of Jacob mistreated their brother Joseph, the Lord still saved them from famine (see\nGenesis 45:4–8\n). When Israel murmured in the wilderness, He fed them with manna (see\nExodus 16:1–4\n). Even when Israel turned to other gods and were scattered, God promised that if they repented, He would gather and redeem them “with great mercies” (see\nIsaiah 54:7\n). Truly, the Old Testament is a story of God’s patient, enduring love. And this story continues today. Jesus Christ, “the Sun of Righteousness,” as Malachi called Him, has come “with healing in his wings” (\nMalachi 4:2\n). He is the greatest evidence of God’s love for ancient Israel and for all of us.\nFor more information about the book of Malachi, see “\nMalachi\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMalachi 1–4\n“Return unto me, and I will return unto you.”\nIn Malachi’s day, the Israelites had already rebuilt the temple in Jerusalem, but as a people they still needed to rebuild their relationship with the Lord. As you study Malachi, look for questions that the Lord asked the Israelites or that they asked Him. Consider asking yourself similar questions (some examples are suggested below) to help you evaluate your relationship with the Lord and draw closer to Him.\nHow have I felt the Lord’s love for me? (see\nMalachi 1:2\n).\nDo my offerings to the Lord truly honor Him? (see\nMalachi 1:6–11\n)\nIn what ways do I need to “return” to the Lord? (see\nMalachi 3:7\n).\nAm I robbing God in any way? (see\nMalachi 3:8–11\n).\nHow does my attitude during difficult times reflect my feelings toward the Lord? (see\nMalachi 3:13–15\n; see also\n2:17\n).\nMalachi 1:6–14\nThe Lord asks for “a pure offering.”\nAs you read about the offerings described in\nMalachi 1\n, what do you notice about the sacrifices the priests were offering? What do these sacrifices suggest about the priests’ feelings toward the Lord? (see\nMalachi 1:13\n). Consider making a list of offerings, or sacrifices, that you make to the Lord. For each item on the list, ponder what might make it a “polluted” offering or a “pure” offering (\nMalachi 1:7, 11\n).\nMalachi 3:8–12\nThe Lord opens the windows of heaven as I show my faith by paying tithing.\nImagine you have a friend who just found out that you pay tithing. “Why do you do that?” your friend asks. Think about this as you read\nMalachi 3:8–12\n. What do you find there that could help answer your friend’s question? What else would you want your friend to understand about tithing? For more help, you could search Elder Neil L. Andersen’s message “\nTithing: Opening the Windows of Heaven\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 32–35), looking for answers to questions like these:\nWhy does the Lord want us to pay tithing?\nWhat might keep someone from paying tithing, and how can we overcome those obstacles?\nHow does paying tithing strengthen our faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\nYou could also share with your friend how the Lord has blessed you when you pay tithing. You can find ideas in the section titled “\nLesson Number 1—Significant but Subtle Blessings\n” in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “\nThe Windows of Heaven\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 17–18). What kind of people do we become by paying tithing?\nWhat do you think the phrase “open you the windows of heaven” (\nverse 10\n) might mean? Maybe you could look out a window and think about the purposes of windows. Why is “windows of heaven” a good way to describe how the Lord blesses us when we pay tithing?\nVision in the Kirtland Temple\n, by Gary Smith\nMalachi 4:5–6\n“I will send you Elijah the prophet.”\nWhen Moroni quoted\nMalachi 4:5–6\nto Joseph Smith, he did so “with a little variation from the way it reads” in the Bible (see\nJoseph Smith—History 1:36–39\n). What does Moroni’s variation add to your understanding of this prophecy? In particular, ponder questions like these:\nWho are “the fathers”? (see\nDeuteronomy 29:13\n). What promises have been made to them? (see\nAbraham 2:9–11\n). How do you help fulfill these promises?\nWhat experiences have helped you turn your heart to your ancestors? Why is that so important to Heavenly Father’s plan?\nTo learn more about the coming of Elijah and how this prophecy is being fulfilled today, see\nDoctrine and Covenants 110:13–16\nand D. Todd Christofferson, “\nThe Sealing Power\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 19–22). Why are you grateful that Elijah has come?\nSee also Gerrit W. Gong, “\nWe Each Have a Story\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 43–46; “\nTurn Your Hearts\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 291; “The Sealing Power” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\n3:38\nThe Sealing Power\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nMalachi 1:2\nThe Lord loves me.\nHow would you and your children answer the question in\nMalachi 1:2\n—“Wherein hast [the Lord] loved us?” Share with each other reasons you know He loves you. Maybe your children could draw pictures that remind them of His love.\nEngage children in gospel discussions.\nIf you are teaching younger children, you may need to think of creative ways to involve them in gospel discussions. For example, your children could pass around a ball; when they are holding the ball, they could share one reason they know Jesus loves them.\nMalachi 3:8–12\nThe Lord will bless me as I pay tithing.\nHow will you help your children learn about tithing? You could ask them to count 10 small objects, such as the coins on this week’s activity page. Then they could separate one of the objects from the rest—this is how much we give to the Lord as tithing. According to\nMalachi 3:8–12\n, why does the Lord want us to pay tithing? (see also “\nMalachi the Prophet\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 171–72; “First Things First!” [video], Gospel Library).\n0:58\nMalachi the Prophet\n1:18\nFirst Things First!\nAs you read\nMalachi 3:10\ntogether, you could invite your children to stand by a window when you read the phrase “windows of heaven.” Or you could pour water into a cup until it overflows to illustrate the phrase “there shall not be room enough to receive it.” Tell the children about the blessings God has given you as you pay tithing. Your children could draw pictures representing these blessings and hang them on or near a window in your home.\nMalachi 4:5–6\nElijah came to turn our hearts to our families.\nIn\nMalachi 4:5–6\n, your children could look for answers to the following questions about Malachi’s prophecy:\nWho\ndid the Lord promise to send?\nWhen\ndid He say this person would come?\nWhat\ndid the Lord say that this person would do?\nWhy\nwould this person need to come?\nWhere\nwas this prophecy fulfilled? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 110:13–16\n).\nTo find out how the promise in\nMalachi 4:5\nwas fulfilled, you can also review “Joseph and Oliver Receive Priesthood Keys” in\nDoctrine and Covenants Stories\n, 26–30. A song like “\nThe Hearts of the Children\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 92) can help your children learn why it was so important that Elijah came. You could also visit\nFamilySearch.org/discovery\n, the\nFamilySearch Tree app\n, or the\nMy Family\nbooklet\nfor activities that can help you and your children turn your hearts to your ancestors.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

        "content": "The Old Testament carries a spirit of eager anticipation. In that way, it’s a little bit like the Christmas season. Beginning with Adam and Eve, Old Testament patriarchs, prophets, poets, and people looked forward to better days, filled with hope for the Messiah’s renewal and deliverance. And the Israelites were frequently in need of that hope—whether they were in captivity in Egypt or Babylon or held captive by their own sin or rebellion. Through it all, prophets reminded them that a Messiah, a Deliverer, would come “to proclaim liberty to the captives” (\nIsaiah 61:1\n).\nThat hope began to be realized when Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem. The mighty Deliverer of Israel was born in a stable and laid in a manger (see\nLuke 2:7\n). But He wasn’t just the Deliverer of the ancient Israelites. He came to deliver you—to bear your grief, to carry your sorrows, to be bruised for your iniquities, so that with His stripes you can be healed (see\nIsaiah 53:4–5\n). This is why Christmas is so full of joyful anticipation even today. The Messiah came over 2,000 years ago, and He continues to come into our lives whenever we seek Him.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nI rejoice in my Redeemer.\nChristmas is known as a joyful season because of the joy that Jesus Christ brings to the world. Centuries before the Savior was born, Old Testament prophets also felt joy as they spoke of the coming Messiah. Read some of the following passages, and think about why they would have been precious to people who looked forward to the Savior’s mission:\nPsalm 35:9\n;\nIsaiah 25:8–9\n;\n44:21–24\n;\n51:11\n;\nZephaniah 3:14–20\n;\nMoses 5:5–11\n. Why are these passages precious to you? What reasons do these scripture passages give to be joyful?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nGood Tidings of Great Joy\n” (First Presidency Christmas devotional, Dec. 4, 2022), Gospel Library; “\nJoy to the World\n,”\nHymns\n, no 201.\nSymbols can help me remember Jesus Christ.\nMany of the traditions associated with Christmas can have symbolic meanings that point us to Christ. As you studied the Old Testament this year, you may have noticed many symbols of the Savior. A few are listed below. Consider studying these and recording what they teach you about Him.\nStar\n(\nNumbers 24:17\n;\nMatthew 2:2\n;\nRevelation 22:16\n).\nShepherd\n(\nPsalm 23\n;\nLuke 15:4–7\n;\nJohn 10:11\n)\nLamb\n(\nGenesis 22:8\n;\nExodus 12:5\n;\n1 Peter 1:18–20\n).\nWater\n(\nExodus 17:1–6\n;\nJeremiah 2:13\n;\nEzekiel 47:1–12\n;\nJohn 4:7–14\n).\nRock\n(\n1 Samuel 2:2\n;\n2 Samuel 22:2–3\n;\nPsalm 118:22–23\n;\nIsaiah 28:16\n;\nEphesians 2:20\n).\nBranch\n(\nIsaiah 11:1–2\n;\nJeremiah 23:5\n;\n33:15\n).\nLight\n(\nPsalm 27:1\n;\nIsaiah 9:2\n;\n60:19\n;\nMicah 7:8\n;\nJohn 8:12\n).\nWhat other symbols, passages, and accounts have you found in the scriptures that testify of Jesus Christ?\nSee also\n2 Nephi 11:4\n;\nMosiah 3:14–15\n;\nMoses 6:63\n; “\nTypes or Symbols of Christ\n” and “\nJesus Christ\n,” both in Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library).\n“His name shall be called Wonderful.”\nJesus Christ is referred to by many different names and titles. Look for titles in the following verses:\nPsalms 23:1\n;\n83:18\n;\nIsaiah 7:14\n;\n9:6\n;\n12:2\n;\n63:16\n;\nAmos 4:13\n;\nZechariah 14:16\n;\nMoses 7:53\n. What other titles can you think of? You might even enjoy listing titles of Jesus Christ that you find in Christmas hymns. How does each title influence the way you think about Him?\nConsider choosing a title or role of the Savior that will help you remember Him throughout the coming year.\nSee also Quentin L. Cook, “\nPersonal Peace in Challenging Times\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 89–92; “\nHark! The Herald Angels Sing\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 209.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nThe Old Testament teaches me about Jesus.\nYou and your children might have some Christmas decorations you can use to start a conversation about Jesus Christ. Maybe you could talk about how a Christmas star, lights, or a gift reminds us of the Savior. Then you could look in one or more of the following scriptures for something that could symbolize Jesus Christ:\nGenesis 22:8\n;\nNumbers 24:17\n;\nPsalms 23:1\n;\n27:1\n. Maybe your children could hold up a picture or decoration that goes with each verse as they read it. How is Jesus like a lamb, star, shepherd, or light? Consider singing a Christmas song together, like “\nStars Were Gleaming\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 37).\nYour children could also look at the picture at the end of this outline as you read\nIsaiah 9:6\nto them. Ask your children to point to the baby Jesus when they hear the phrase “a child is born.” Share your testimony that prophets in the Old Testament knew that Jesus would be born.\nAs you prepare to study the life of Jesus Christ in the New Testament next year, consider reviewing with your children what they have learned about Him this year in the Old Testament. You might review the outlines in this resource and any personal study notes to help you remember what you’ve learned. Younger children might benefit from looking through\nOld Testament Stories\nor the pictures in\nCome, Follow Me\n. What prophecies or stories stood out? What have we learned about the Savior?\nChristmas traditions can point to Jesus Christ.\nIsraelite families had traditions, such as the Passover and other feasts, that were meant to point their hearts and minds to the Lord (see\nExodus 12\n). What traditions do you and your children have at Christmastime that help you focus on Jesus Christ? What traditions do you know about from your family history? You might consider discussing with your children some traditions you want to start. Some ideas might include serving someone in need, choosing something you will offer as a “gift” to the Savior, inviting a friend to watch the First Presidency’s Christmas devotional with you (\nbroadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n), writing your own Christmas song, or finding a creative way to share the message of Christ’s birth.\nIn the home, learning and living are inseparable.\n“The gospel takes on immediate relevance in the home. There the people with whom you are learning the gospel are the people with whom you will live it—every day. In fact, much of the time, living the gospel is\nhow\nwe learn the gospel. So as you learn and teach the gospel at home, look for ways to connect what you are learning with what you are doing. In your home, let the gospel be something you strive to live by, not just something you talk about” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n31\n).\nIllustration of the Nativity, by Ethan Brown\nHeavenly Father gave me the gift of His Son to be my Savior.\nHow can you help your children feel the reverence and joy of Christ’s birth? You might watch the video “The Christ Child” (Gospel Library) or read together\nMatthew 1:18–25\n;\n2:1–12\n;\nLuke 1:26–38\n;\n2:1–20\n. Each child could choose a person from the video or scripture account and share how that person felt about the Savior. Then you could share with each other your own feelings about Him.\n17:57\nThe Christ Child\nPerhaps you and your children could talk about gifts you’ve given or received over the years that have brought joy. Then you could read\nIsaiah 25:9\ntogether and talk about why you rejoice that Heavenly Father sent us a Savior. To help your children better understand Jesus Christ’s role as our Savior, invite them to read\nIsaiah 25:8–9\n;\n53:3–5\n; and\nHosea 13:14\n. What do these scriptures teach us about how the Lord saves us?\nYou could also sing a Christmas song together, such as “\nAway in a Manger\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 42–43) or “\nO Little Town of Bethlehem\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 208). Help your children find phrases in the song that help them know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love them.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",
