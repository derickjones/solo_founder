      "content": "\n--- Lesson 1 ---\nThe Old Testament contains many teachings and symbols about the Lord Jesus Christ and His role as Savior of the world. Stories from the Old Testament can help students learn about Him and see how He is involved in our lives. This lesson is intended to help students increase their desire to come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ through their study of the Old Testament. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to review a favorite story from the Old Testament and ponder what that story might teach about Heavenly Father or Jesus Christ. Possible Learning Activities Our focus To begin the lesson, think of how you can help students look more carefully for the Savior in the Old Testament. One way to do this is to put up several pictures of the Savior around the room before class. After class begins, you could ask students how many pictures of the Savior they noticed and discuss why they did or did not notice the pictures. Another way to do this is to explain to students that they are about to watch a video showing two teams: one wearing white and one wearing black. Both teams will be passing a basketball. Invite students to try to correctly count the number of passes the team in white makes. Show the video “ Focus Test ,” found at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 0:00 to 0:22. Then pause the video. 1:2 How many passes did you count? Did you notice anything else happening in the video? If so, what? Play the remainder of the video (it repeats the same passing drill) and invite students to watch for anything they may not have seen the first time. What did you notice that you hadn’t seen the first time? If needed, you could point out that an older woman walked across the floor, a ninja warrior wearing black replaced one of the players, some boys put on hats, and some passed a football instead of a basketball. Why did you not see some of those things the first time watching? How might this be similar to what someone might experience when reading the stories of the Old Testament? With either approach to starting the lesson, be sure it is clear to students that, if we are not careful, we might focus on other things and overlook what the Old Testament has to teach us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Read the following statement by Elder Michael T. Ringwood of the Seventy, looking for what we can learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as we read the Old Testament. We are the focus of Heavenly Father’s plan and the reason for our Savior’s mission. Chapter after chapter [of the Old Testament] we discover examples of how Heavenly Father and [Jesus Christ] are intimately involved in our lives. (“ For God So Loved Us ,” Liahona , May 2022, 88–89) According to Elder Ringwood, what does the Old Testament show us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Students might come up with truths similar to: We are the focus of Heavenly Father’s plan and the reason for the Savior’s mission. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are intimately involved in our lives. Ask students to share what they think and feel about these truths and why they may be meaningful to them. Invite students to complete the following self-assessment on their own. They can record their answers in a study journals. Think of any experiences you have had with the Old Testament. What has your experience with the Old Testament been like? If you have had experiences with the Old Testament, have they helped you feel closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? As you study this lesson, seek help through the Holy Ghost to know how to come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ through your study of the Old Testament. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in the Old Testament Consider asking students to share things they already know about the Old Testament. If needed, you might share that the Old Testament begins with an account of the Creation of the world and of Adam and Eve. It relates the stories of many prophets and people who mostly live in and around Israel and ends about 400 BC. Then, explain the following in your own words. As you study the Old Testament, it will refer to the Lord or Jehovah. It is helpful to know that Jehovah is Jesus Christ. Jehovah did the will of Heavenly Father in all things. As you learn about Jehovah, you also learn about Heavenly Father, who guided and empowered Him. Display several pictures in a circular pattern that depict Old Testament stories. (It might be helpful to prepare yourself before class by briefly reviewing the stories that are presented.) In the center of these pictures, place an image of Jesus Christ. You may choose to use images like the following. Alternatively, you might display the image of Jesus Christ and invite students to think of stories on their own that illustrate His involvement and love in the Old Testament. Students could write simple titles for those stories around the Savior. The stories are listed below, starting from the top and working around clockwise. Joseph in Egypt ( Genesis 37:23–28 ; 39:1–5 ). After Joseph shared his dream with his family, Joseph’s brothers conspired against him. Moses parting the Red Sea ( Exodus 14:10, 13–16, 21–22 ). The children of Israel were fleeing Egypt when Pharaoh’s army approached to attack and enslave them again. Serpent on the pole ( Numbers 21:4–9 ). After the Lord delivered the Israelites from Egypt and miraculously provided bread from heaven, the Israelites complained against God. David and Goliath ( 1 Samuel 17:43–49 ). Goliath the Philistine warrior challenged Israel to send their best fighter against him. David volunteered to face him. Fiery furnace ( Daniel 3:4–6, 12–13, 16–25 ). King Nebuchadnezzar set up a golden image and called the rulers of his land together to dedicate it. Lion’s den ( Daniel 6:7, 10, 16–23 ). Darius made Daniel a ruler in Babylon. Other rulers conspired against him so he would lose favor with the king. Consider organizing students into pairs or small groups. Students could choose one or more stories, read the associated verses, and discuss the following questions. How does this story demonstrate the love or involvement of both Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? How can understanding the story this way be helpful to you? You might invite students to share with the class insights gained from their discussion. If students do not mention it, explain that studying how the Lord is involved in the lives of individuals in the Old Testament can help us ponder how He is involved in our lives. Invite students to ponder how the Lord has blessed and helped them. Ask a few students to share their thoughts and experiences if they are not too personal. Studying the Old Testament This may be a good opportunity to remind students of their daily scripture study goals. You could invite students to seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost as they review, adjust, or create scripture study goals. You might ask students if any of them would like to share their goals with the class to help generate ideas for others. Consider inviting students to discuss as a class or write their answers in their study journals to the following questions. What have you learned today that you think could help you in your study of the Old Testament? Why would it be a blessing to you to experience and recognize the love and involvement of both Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in your life? To help students with their study of the Old Testament this year, you might invite them to mark in their scriptures or note in their study journals every time they see evidence of God’s love or involvement in the lives of His children. Consider concluding with your testimony of how studying the Old Testament can help us draw closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and gain faith in Their involvement in our lives. You might invite students to share with their families what they learned today. This could help their families as they study the Old Testament.\n\n\n--- Lesson 2 ---\nIn our premortal realm, we “shouted for joy” ( Job 38:7 ) as we learned about Heavenly Father’s plan for our eternal progress. Jehovah was chosen to be our Savior and Redeemer, providing the way for us to return to the Father and become as He is. This lesson can help students understand Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation and the central role of Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder what they know about Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation and the Savior’s central role in our eternal progress. Students could write down elements of the plan of salvation they are familiar with and practice explaining them to a family member or friend. Possible Learning Activities Answering life’s questions To begin class, consider displaying and sharing the following. Your friend Jonathan approaches you and asks: Where did we come from? What is the purpose of life? What happens after we die? Invite students to reflect on what they already know about Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness. The following study journal activity is one way you could do this. Be sure students understand that they will have an opportunity to practice answering Jonathan’s questions later in the lesson. In your study journal, answer the following questions to help you reflect on what you already understand about Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. How confident are you in your ability to answer Jonathan’s questions? What questions do you have about Heavenly Father’s plan? As you study today, seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to help increase your understanding of Heavenly Father’s plan and the Savior’s central role. Jesus Christ is central to the Father’s plan of happiness Helping students identify the different titles, roles, and attributes of Jesus Christ can increase their connection to Him. To help students understand the central role Jesus Christ plays in each element of Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation, you could display the following image. Consider inviting students to share their thoughts about what this illustration teaches about the Savior. (For additional teacher training on identifying the titles, roles, and attributes of Jesus Christ, see: “ Emphasize the example of Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills.) After adequate time for students to discuss what the image is teaching, you could display the statement from President Dallin H. Oaks. President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency explained the Savior’s role in Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation: What has Jesus Christ done for each of us? He has done everything that is essential for our journey through mortality toward the destiny outlined in the plan of our Heavenly Father. … His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, is the central figure. (“ What Has Our Savior Done for Us? ,” Liahona , May 2021, 75) How would you summarize President Oaks’s teaching as a statement of truth? Help students identify a truth such as Jesus Christ is central to Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation and our eternal progress. It might be helpful to write this truth on the board. Heavenly Father’s plan and the Savior’s central role The following activity is intended to help students deepen their understanding of Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation and the Savior’s role in it. Students who are especially familiar with the plan of salvation could be invited to use their scripture study tools to find scripture passages and statements from Church leaders to answer Jonathan’s three questions on the board. If students need additional guidance, consider giving them a copy of the handout titled “Heavenly Father’s Plan of Salvation.” They could be invited to study the handout individually or in small groups. One way to do this could be to cut the handout into three sections and place the sections around the room. Students could rotate through each location in the room individually or with their groups as they study the plan of salvation. Display the following instructions to help guide the students as they study. As you study about Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation, look for the following: How Jesus Christ plays a central role in Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. Truths you could share with Jonathan to help answer his questions. Record your insights in your study journal. After students have finished studying, provide an opportunity for them to share the insights and understanding they gained. Students could practice sharing what they learned by role-playing how they would answer each of Jonathan’s three questions. You could also invite them to discuss the following questions with a partner or together with the class. What did you learn about the central role Jesus Christ plays in Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation? What truths or teachings could you share with Jonathan that could help answer his questions? Think about what you learned Consider concluding the lesson by inviting the students to reflect quietly on what they felt about Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the plan of salvation. Invite them to consider any actions they have felt prompted to take. They could record their insight and spiritual impressions in their study journals.\n\n\n--- Lesson 3 ---\nIn a vision, Jehovah showed Abraham His works and creations. He also showed Abraham the premortal existence, including the noble and great spirits chosen to be leaders in mortality. This lesson can help students understand how a knowledge of the premortal life in Heavenly Father’s plan can help them in their lives. Student preparation: Invite students to ask a friend or family member what they know about the premortal life and how knowing about the premortal life could help them. Possible Learning Activities How old are you? Invite several students to share how old they are. Point out that the age they shared is how long they have been in their physical body during their lifetime. Our spirits have existed far longer than our physical bodies. Before birth, we lived with Heavenly Father and the Savior Jesus Christ. We call this our premortal life. Ask students to write their answers to the following questions in their study journals. What are some of the things you know about the premortal life? How can knowledge about the premortal life help you now? Encourage students to add to their answers as they continue this lesson. Encourage them to seek help from the Heavenly Father through the Holy Ghost to learn how knowledge about the premortal life can help them. What we learn from Abraham To help students to know where the Book of Abraham came from, you could invite them to share what they know, or share some of the following in your own words. Abraham recorded an experience that can help us understand more about the premortal life. Abraham was born about 2,000 years before the birth of Jesus Christ. He recorded a few details of his life along with visions he received from God that can be found in the book of Abraham. This record originated from scrolls of papyrus discovered in Egypt and purchased by members of the Church. This record was then revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith by the gift and power of God. Read Abraham 3:11–12, 21 to see what the Lord taught Abraham. What stood out to you from these verses? What truths did you learn about the Lord? As students share, invite them to point out phrases or verses where their insights come from so other students can mark them if they would like. How might understanding these truths about Jesus Christ influence you now? How have you witnessed or experienced these truths about the Savior in your life? Our premortal life After learning of the premortal greatness of Jesus Christ (see Abraham 3:16–21 ), Abraham also learned about our premortal existence. Before reading what the Lord showed Abraham, imagine what it would be like if you were able to view your premortal life with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Ponder how it might affect you. Allow sufficient time for students to imagine the effect of observing themselves in their premortal state with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Abraham 3:22–23 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Abraham 3:22–23 , looking for what Abraham learned in his vision about premortal life. It may be helpful to know that “intelligences” in these verses refer to premortal spirits. What truths do you think Abraham may have learned or understood better because of this experience? Write the various truths students share on the board. If students do not mention it, add the following: God chose His noble and great spirit children to become rulers before they were born. This is often referred to as foreordination. How do you think the world’s definition of “noble and great” would be different than the Lord’s? Are we part of the noble and great ones? In a worldwide devotional, President Russell M. Nelson spoke of one way the truth taught in Abraham 3 applies to you. Our Heavenly Father has reserved many of His most noble spirits—perhaps, I might say, His finest team—for this final phase. Those noble spirits—those finest players, those heroes—are you! … You are among the best the Lord has ever sent to this world. You have the capacity to be smarter and wiser and have more impact on the world than any previous generation! (“ Hope of Israel ” [worldwide youth devotional, June 3, 2018], 8, 16) Consider inviting students to mark their scriptures in a way that will help them remember what President Nelson taught. After verse 22 they might write the phrase “including me,” or they could write their name above Abraham’s name in verse 23 , or they could perhaps link Abraham 3:22–23 with President Nelson’s statement above in Gospel Library. If useful, give students some time to learn more about the premortal life. They could study “premortal life” in Guide to the Scriptures or the Topical Guide . Or students could make a scripture chain, linking verses about the premortal life like Jeremiah 1:4–5 ; Alma 13:3–4 ; and Doctrine and Covenants 138:55–56 . Ask students to share what they found and why it is meaningful to them. Do the following in small groups and then present some of their thoughts to the class. Imagine that someone in your class is unsure how Abraham 3:22–23 applies to them. Prepare the following: A summary of what Abraham 3:22–23 and President Nelson taught. Ideas for how you or other youth could affect others for good or bring them closer to Jesus Christ. How you feel your understanding of the premortal life can help you in your life. As students share, look for appropriate ways to emphasize that Heavenly Father sent them here at this time to help others come closer to Him. Also, offer sincere compliments and praise to students for their willingness to participate. Doing this helps students know you value their contribution. Your efforts can help increase their motivation to share their thoughts with the class again. For additional training, see “ Create an environment where all are respected and know their contributions are valued ” in Teacher Development Skills . Consider sharing your testimony of the truths in this lesson. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase is “As spirits we ‘were organized before the world was.’” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 4 ---\nOn a high mountain, Moses “saw God face to face and talked with Him” ( Moses 1:2 ). God told Moses, “Thou art my son” ( Moses 1:4 ) and “I have a work for thee” ( Moses 1:6 ). The purpose of this lesson is to help students feel that they are children of God and He has a work for them to do. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder or write what they believe their purpose is in life. Possible Learning Activities Something for you to do Write on the board, “ (Your name), I have something I want you to do.” Ask students how they feel when someone tells them they have something they want them to do. Consider asking the following questions. Do you feel differently depending on who asks? Why or why not? How would you feel if it was God that was saying it to you? Why? Invite students to answer the following questions in their scripture journals. Do you believe that God has a work for you in this life? Why or why not? How well do you feel you know what God wants you to do? What do you think you would have to know about God and yourself for that work to be motivating? As students study Moses 1 in this lesson, invite them to seek help through the Holy Ghost to know more about themselves, God, and what He wants them to do in this life. The example of Moses Invite students to find the book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price. Explain that God revealed the Book of Moses through the Prophet Joseph Smith as he worked on the inspired translation of Genesis 1 through Genesis 6:13 . It contains the words God commanded Moses to record ( Moses 1:40 ). Consider displaying a picture of Moses such as the following. What do you know about Moses and his life? If needed, explain that before the Lord performed miracles through Moses to lead his people out of slavery, Moses was born an Israelite (a member of God’s covenant people) but was adopted by a royal Egyptian family. Eventually he had to flee from Egypt to a new land to preserve his life, leaving the only family he had known. If you were in Moses’s situation, what thoughts might you have about the purpose for your life? Some time after Moses had fled Egypt, the Savior appeared to Moses “face to face” ( Moses 1:2 ). Jesus Christ, being one with Heavenly Father, spoke to Moses as if He were God the Father. Therefore, we can read these verses to better understand both the Father and the Son. Moses learned much about Heavenly Father and His relationship to Him that led him to do an important work. To help students discover what Moses learned, draw the following chart on the board. In this activity, students could copy the chart in their study journals or complete it as a class on the board. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ Moses Read Moses 1:1–11 , imagining what it would be like to have this experience. On the chart, write what the verses teach about Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and Moses. An alternative way to study these verses is to show the video “ I Am a Son of God ” from time code 0:00 to 2:49. After the video, you could invite students to read the verses, looking for important statements or details that were not in the video. Invite students to share what they found in the scriptures as they completed the chart and why it may be important or meaningful to them. If needed, ask the following questions. 6:31 What stood out to you about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Why? As students share, look for ways to emphasize the greatness of God. You might ask students to point out phrases that highlight His power. What did God tell Moses in verses 4, 6–7 that also applies to you? Students might identify a truth like: We are children of God and He has a work for us to do. Consider inviting students to record this truth in their scriptures or mark phrases that teach it. How does knowing the greatness of God make being His child more meaningful? How might understanding that we are children of God help us understand our purpose or purposes in this life? Note: It may be useful to know that, in the next lesson on Moses 1:12–26 , students will study how Moses’s understanding of his identity as a son of God gave him power to resist Satan’s temptation. Also, the lesson on Genesis 1:26–27 in the following week will help students feel the importance of their identity and potential as sons and daughters of heavenly parents. The work God has for us To help students to ponder how God has an important work for each of his children, consider doing the following activity. Draw three stick figures in your study journal. Learn about the work God had for the individuals in the following examples and label the stick figures. Then write the answers to the following questions next to or below each figure. Moses. Look up “Moses” in the Bible Dictionary or Guide to the Scriptures . Girish (a man born and raised in Nepal who found the gospel and eventually moved to Utah). Read the following or watch “ I Have a Work for Thee ” (10:25) from time code 0:18 to 1:12. 10:25 Years later, when more than 1,500 refugees from camps in Nepal were relocated to Utah, Girish felt inspired to help. With native-language fluency and cultural understanding, Girish served as an interpreter, teacher, and mentor. … A Nepali-speaking branch was organized, and Girish later served as its branch president. He was also instrumental in translating the Book of Mormon into Nepali. (John C. Pingree Jr., “ I Have a Work for Thee ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2017, 32) A discouraged sister. Read the following. One day, a discouraged sister pleaded, “Lord, what is my personal ministry?” He answered, “Notice others.” … Since then, she has found joy in noticing those who are regularly forgotten, and God has worked through her to bless many. (John C. Pingree Jr., “ I Have a Work for Thee ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2017, 33) You could substitute the story of Girish or the discouraged sister with another modern-day example you know. It may be useful to display the following questions on the board. What did the individual do to help others and bring them to Jesus Christ? Why might a loving God want them to do this work? How were they uniquely prepared to help? Or how did they help in a unique or personal way? As students share what they found, look for ways to make clear that not all work the Lord wants us to do is big or grand, but it is always significant to the Lord and to those of His children we serve. The specific tasks and responsibilities the Lord may give us will help us take part in His work of salvation and exaltation (see Moses 1:39 ). There may also be tasks He wants to focus on now, but He may ask us to focus on something different in the future. A work for you Draw an additional stick figure and write your name below it. Elder John C. Pingree Jr. of the Seventy testified: To Moses, God declared, “I have a work for thee” ( Moses 1:6 ). Have you ever wondered if Heavenly Father has a work for you? Are there important things He has prepared you—and specifically you—to accomplish? I testify the answer is yes! (“ I Have a Work for Thee ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2017, 32) Consider inviting students to say a silent prayer and seek revelation from the Lord as they answer some or all of the following questions around the stick figure of themselves. It may be helpful to explain that students may not receive complete answers to these questions in class. Invite them to continue to ponder and pray about them. What am I already doing that may be part of God’s work for me in this life? What has God already revealed to me about what He wants me to do? (This could include priesthood blessings, callings, patriarchal blessings, and other moments of revelation.) How might God want me personally to do His work in my family? in my ward or branch? How might God want me to prepare to help others now or in the future? If not too personal, invite students to share impressions or feelings they had as they studied today. Consider sharing your testimony and feelings about the principles in this lesson.\n\n\n--- Lesson 5 ---\nWe all have felt Satan’s temptations. However, like Moses, as we remember who we really are, we can receive strength from God to overcome Satan and his temptations in our lives. The purpose of this lesson is to help students draw strength from God to overcome their personal temptations. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder one of the temptations they personally face and come to class prepared to learn how to overcome it. Possible Learning Activities Facing temptation To prepare students to learn about overcoming temptations, consider sharing the following statement and questions. President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught: We speak boldly because Satan is a real being set on destroying you, and you face his influence at a younger and younger age. (“ We are All Enlisted ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2011, 45) How do you feel about this quote from President Holland? What are some of the temptations Latter-day Saint teenagers face? It may be helpful to write on the board the temptations that students mention. You will ask students to reflect on these later in the lesson. For the following questions, you may consider inviting students to write their answers in a study journal. Ponder a temptation you have faced or you might struggle with. Consider the following: What makes it difficult for you to resist that temptation? What do you do to seek help and strength to resist? How effective do you feel you are at overcoming your temptation? As you study Moses 1:1–26 today, seek guidance from the Holy Ghost to identify truths that can strengthen you as you face temptation. Moses is tempted by Satan Invite students to share what they remember from the previous lesson, or they could briefly review Moses 1:1–10 and reflect on what they learned. If needed, remind them that Moses “saw God face to face, and he talked with him” ( Moses 1:2 ) and that God taught Moses three times that he is His son (see verses 4, 6, and 7 ). Although Moses was a mighty prophet, he also faced great temptation. Shortly after Moses’s experience with God, he had an extremely difficult experience where “Satan came tempting him” ( Moses 1:12 ). Because of what Moses knew and did, he was able to prevail. Read Moses 1:12–22 , looking for what helped Moses overcome Satan’s temptations. Consider marking what you find. You may consider showing the video “ I Am a Son of God ” from time code 2:50 to 6:30, or the entire video if you did not show students the first part in the previous lesson. After the video, you could invite students to read the verses, looking for what helped Moses overcome Satan’s temptations. Students could then discuss the following question in pairs or small groups: 6:31 What do you learn from Moses’s experience that can help us overcome our temptations? Consider writing the following incomplete principle on the board: We can receive God’s help to overcome temptations by … Invite students to come to the board and finish the principle in their own words. If students need help, you could guide them by asking questions such as the following: What did Satan call Moses in verse 12 , and how did Moses respond in verse 13 ? What did Moses recall from his spiritual experience with God that helped him when he was faced with temptation? Students may finish the principle in a number of ways, including some of the following: … remembering that we are children of God … recalling past spiritual experiences … calling upon God for strength After multiple principles have been identified, consider using the following quote and questions to help deepen students’ understanding of the truths they discovered. President Russell M. Nelson shared the following about the power of remembering we are children of God: My dear friends, you are literally spirit children of God. You have sung this truth since you learned the words to “I Am a Child of God.” But is that eternal truth imprinted upon your heart? Has this truth rescued you when confronted with temptation? (“ Choices for Eternity ” [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 15, 2022]) What do you think it means to have the truth that you are a child of God imprinted on your heart? How might remembering we are children of God strengthen us when we face temptation? Why do you think we need God’s help to overcome temptation? Invite students to share examples of when God has strengthened someone against temptation. This could be from scriptures, people close to them, or their own lives. As temptations are personal, remind students not to share any specific temptation. Overcoming personal temptations To help your students understand how they can live the principles discussed today, invite them to select one or two temptations that were written on the board earlier in the lesson. As a class or in small groups, invite students to think of practical ways a person facing that temptation could use these principles to overcome that temptation. Consider inviting students to write their ideas on the board, or you could display some of the following ideas. Ways to apply what we learn in Moses 1:12–26 : Record in your journal a time when you felt the Lord’s love and knew you were a child of God. You could review this during times of temptation. Memorize and rehearse inspiring scriptures, hymns, or the sacrament prayers to repeat to yourself when you are tempted. (This was a strategy the Savior used in Matthew 4:1–11 .) Pray daily for the Lord’s strength and power to overcome the temptation. Report to Heavenly Father each evening to thank Him, acknowledge any weaknesses, ask for forgiveness, and pledge to continue trying (see 3 Nephi 18:15, 18 ). Recall past spiritual experiences you have had and write them down in a journal. Refer to these when temptation arises. Discuss with parents or trusted adults or friends how these principles have helped them and ways they would recommend you apply them. Invite students to make a plan to help them overcome temptations they face. You could do this by providing the following instructions: Recall the temptation you pondered at the beginning of the lesson or another that you struggle with. Share your testimony about the Lord’s power and strength that you have experienced in your life and of His wish to help your students overcome their temptations. Express your confidence in them and in their ability to overcome their temptations with God’s help. Asking Heavenly Father for guidance, complete the following statement in your study journal or in your mind: “To help me prepare against this temptation, I will .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 6 ---\nUnder the direction of Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ has created worlds without number. Heavenly Father’s greatest creations are His spirit sons and daughters. This lesson can help students feel gratitude for Heavenly Father and His work to bring immortality and eternal life to all His children. Student preparation: Invite students to reflect on the vastness of Heavenly Father’s creations and the love Heavenly Father has for each of them. One way they could do this is to look at the sky on a clear night and think about how Heavenly Father feels about them among the many stars, planets, and galaxies He has created. Possible Learning Activities Begotten sons and daughters of God Consider bringing a small container of sand and a small container of water to class. Ask a student to come to the front of the class and put his or her finger into the container of water and then dip the moistened finger into the container of sand. Alternatively, you could show students the following picture. Then ask students to estimate how many grains of sand are in this person’s hands. Read Moses 1:27–29 , looking for what Moses compared to sand upon the seashore and why. What stands out to you from this vision? To help students appreciate the vastness of God’s creations, consider showing “ This Is My Work and Glory ,” available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 0:53 to 1:31. 17:11 To help students contemplate themselves in God’s creations and to prepare their minds to be taught by the Holy Ghost, invite them to complete the following self-assessment. Answer the following questions in your study journal: Why did God create the universe? Why did God create us? How do I feel about God and what He does for me? Invite students to add to their answers throughout the lesson. Remind them that recording their thoughts in a study journal can help invite the influence of the Holy Ghost into their learning. Heavenly Father’s work and glory Read Moses 1:30 , looking for and marking two questions Moses had as he beheld the earth and God’s begotten sons and daughters. Moses 1:39 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Moses 1:31–33, 39 , looking for how the Lord answered Moses’s questions. What truths can we learn from God’s responses in these verses? Among the truths students may find, help them identify God’s work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children . To learn what students understand about immortality and eternal life, you might ask them to share how they would define them. If useful, students could search “ Immortality ” and “ Eternal Life ” in Guide to the Scriptures or Topics and Questions on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Alternatively, you could share the following definition: Immortality means to live forever as a resurrected being. “Eternal life, or exaltation, is to become like God and live in His presence eternally as families” ( General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 1.1 , Gospel Library). How can the truth found in Moses 1:39 help you understand why God created the earth? President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, explained the purpose of God’s creations. 19:30 While we may look at the vast expanse of the universe and say, “What is man in comparison to the glory of creation?” God Himself said we are the reason He created the universe! His work and glory—the purpose for this magnificent universe—is to save and exalt mankind. In other words, the vast expanse of eternity, the glories and mysteries of infinite space and time are all built for the benefit of ordinary mortals like you and me. Our Heavenly Father created the universe that we might reach our potential as His sons and daughters. (“ You Matter to Him ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2011, 20) What does this statement help you understand about Heavenly Father? What does this statement help you understand about yourself? Heavenly Father helps us receive immortality and eternal life Consider placing students in small groups for the following activity. You could give each group a piece of paper and invite students to write the following questions at the top of their paper. Students could then write their responses under the questions. If possible, you might invite students to find a scripture that testifies of some or all of their answers. What have Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ done to bring to pass our immortality? What have They done and continue to do to help us obtain eternal life? To help students learn for themselves, give them enough time to respond to the previous questions. Then ask them to add to their list by reading John 3:16 and the following statement by President Dieter F. Uchtdorf. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, the of the First Presidency, shared additional ways Heavenly Father brings to pass our immortality and eternal life. [Heavenly Father] has given us the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ. He has given us the plan of redemption, the plan of salvation, even the plan of happiness. … He has given us the priceless gift of the Holy Ghost. … He has given us 24/7 access to Him through prayers of faith and supplications of real intent. He has given us modern-day apostles and prophets, who reveal the word of God in our day. … He has restored His Church. … He has given us the holy scriptures—His written word to us. He has given myriad tools of modern technology to help us in our walk of discipleship. … Why has our Heavenly Father given us so much help? Because He loves us. And because, as He said of Himself, “This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” ( Moses 1:39 ). (“ Our Father, Our Mentor ,” Ensign , June 2016, 5) Invite students to select a few of the ways that are most meaningful to them as they respond to the following questions. How can these help us progress toward eternal life? How have some of these ways helped you become more like Heavenly Father? Invite various students to share one way they chose and their answers to the questions above. Look for ways to thank and validate them for their answers. If students do not naturally focus on the Savior, refer to John 3:16 and Mosiah 4:2 , and ask students to share how the Savior helps them progress and become more like Heavenly Father. Appreciation for Heavenly Father To help students feel a greater appreciation for Heavenly Father and His work to bring to pass their immortality and eternal life, invite them to seek the Lord’s help as they respond to the following questions in their study journals. Alternatively, students could make a journal entry expressing their appreciation to Heavenly Father for what He does for them. What have you learned or felt today that you want to remember? How do you feel about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and what They do to help you return to Them? Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase is “This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 7 ---\nThe majesty and beauty of our world testifies of glorious Creators who can transform something that is “without form, and void,” (see Genesis 1:2 ) into the wonders of this earth. This lesson can help students feel love and gratitude for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as they study the Creation of the earth. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder the beauty of the earth and all of God’s creations. Invite them to bring a picture of or be prepared to talk about something in this world that they enjoy. Possible Learning Activities Note: Although accounts of the Creation of the earth are also found in Moses 2 and Abraham 4 , this lesson will focus on the account recorded in Genesis 1 . Great creators and creations To begin class, consider showing pictures of a beautiful building that is a popular destination in your area. You could ask questions such as the following: What do you think makes people want to visit a building like this? How do you think the creators of beautiful buildings feel when people enjoy their work? You could then display a picture of a beautiful landscape near your area. Invite students to do the following to help prepare them for today’s lesson. Think about how you feel or thoughts you have when you see the beauty and majesty of the earth. Consider how often you take time to admire or appreciate these earthly wonders. As you study today, prayerfully invite the Holy Ghost to help you feel love and gratitude to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ for the creation of this world. The Creation Before introducing the following study activity, consider inviting the students to share what they know about the creation of the earth. Then refer students to the following sentence from “ The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles .” Invite students to write this truth in their study journals or as a note in their scriptures. You could also write it on the board. In “ The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles ,” we learn: Under the direction of His Father, [Jesus Christ] was the creator of the earth. (“ The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles ,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org ) Genesis 1 contains some of the details about Jesus Christ creating the earth. Read the account of the first six creative periods from Genesis 1 , looking for what we learn about the Creator and creation. As students study the following verses, you could invite them to identify and mark each “day” of Creation in their scriptures. One way to do this is to copy the following chart on the board and give students time to complete it. You could organize students into smaller groups and assign each group one set of verses to study from the chart. It might be helpful to explain that the word “day” refers to a period of creation, not a specific span of time (see Abraham 4 , where the creative periods are labeled “time”). Note : The creation of man and woman will be addressed in greater depth in lessons “ Genesis 1:26–27 ” and “ Genesis 1:28–2:25 .” Be careful that this portion of the lesson does not take too long so students will have enough time to focus on the section titled “The Savior’s role as Creator.” Day 1: Genesis 1:1–5 Divided light from the darkness Day 2: Genesis 1:6–8 Day 3: Genesis 1:9–13 Day 4: Genesis 1:14–19 Day 5: Genesis 1:20–23 Day 7: Genesis 1:24–27 What thoughts or feelings do you have about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you study these verses? Students may have questions about some of the details of the Creation. Help them understand that the accounts of the Creation are not meant to provide a literal, scientific explanation of the specific processes, time periods, or events involved. It may be helpful to read Doctrine and Covenants 101:32–34 and reassure the students that the Savior will reveal all things in His time. The Savior’s role as Creator Give students an opportunity to deepen their appreciation for Jesus Christ as the Creator. One way to do this could be to draw a picture on the board of the earth and display the following scripture references for students to study. You could invite them to study some or all of the verses and come to the board to write meaningful phrases they found around the picture of the earth. As students study these verses, invite them to pay close attention to how the Spirit can testify to them of the Savior’s role as the Creator. Select one or more of the following verses to study, looking for teachings that can enhance your understanding and appreciation of Jesus Christ as the Creator. Alma 30:43–44 Doctrine and Covenants 38:1–3 Doctrine and Covenants 59:18–20 Doctrine and Covenants 76:22–24 Moses 1:33, 39 Moses 6:63 Invite students to share their insights. One way you could do this is by displaying the following questions for students to discuss. What were some meaningful words or phrases from the verses you studied? Why? What did these verses help you learn or feel about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Invite students to reflect on how the Savior’s role as Creator has impacted their lives. As part of this reflection time, you could consider showing “ We Lived with God ” (4:00), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 4:0 You could also use the story from President Boyd K. Packer in “ Additional Resources .” Express gratitude for the Creator This portion of the lesson is intended to help students express their love and gratitude to Jesus Christ because of His role as Creator. To help them do this, consider using one or more of the following activities. You could display the options you select and invite students to choose one to complete. Write a poem or journal entry that expresses gratitude for Jesus Christ and His creations. Draw a picture that represents your feelings toward the Savior and His creations. Select a hymn that is about the Savior and His creations. Study the words to the music. You could search “Jesus Christ—Creator” in the Topic section of the hymnbook. You could write an additional verse to the hymn that reflects your feelings about Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Creation. After enough time, invite students to share what they learned and felt from the activity. Look for opportunities to use sacred music to invite the influence of the Spirit. Inspirational music can create a feeling of reverence and help students feel the power of the truths they are learning. If students selected meaningful hymns to express their love and gratitude to Jesus Christ, the class could sing one or more of them together, and students could share the additional verse they wrote. (For additional teacher training on the use of inspirational music, see “ Create settings and opportunities for learners to be taught by the Holy Ghost ” in Teacher Development Skills .) You could also invite students to read the poem or journal entry they wrote. You could display the artwork students created and invite them to share what they depicted and why. Consider concluding class by sharing your feelings about the Savior’s role in the Creation.\n\n\n--- Lesson 8 ---\nDuring the sixth period of creation, God created man and woman. Every person on earth is a beloved son or daughter of heavenly parents and has a divine nature and destiny. This lesson can help students feel the importance of their identity and potential as sons and daughters of heavenly parents. Student preparation: Invite students to memorize or review the opening lines of the Young Women and Aaronic Priesthood themes and to reflect on the significance of each statement: Possible Learning Activities Identities and labels Consider drawing a timeline on the board and invite students to create their own personal timeline in their study journals. A sample timeline is provided below. Draw a horizontal line representing your life and label it with various identities or titles you have had in the past, currently have, or anticipate having in the future. This could include “friend,” “student,” or a job title or calling you have had. The following is an example: What are some identities or titles you chose to put on your timeline? Why? In what ways could these identities or titles influence choices you make? President Russell M. Nelson explained how the ways we label ourselves can affect us. 31:24 Labels can be fun and indicate your support for any number of positive things. Many labels will change for you with the passage of time. And not all labels are of equal value. But if any label replaces your most important identifiers, the results can be spiritually suffocating. (“ Choices for Eternity ” [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 15, 2022], broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org) How do you think some labels could be spiritually suffocating? Children of heavenly parents Read Genesis 1:26–27 and the following statement from “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” looking for insights about your eternal identity. Genesis 1:26–27 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. All human beings—male and female—are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose. (“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org ) What insights did you gain about your eternal identity? One truth students may have identified is that we are sons and daughters of heavenly parents, created in their image . If they have not already done so, invite students to write “Child of God” across their timeline. What do you think it means to be created in God’s image? President Thomas S. Monson (1927–2018) shared the following insight about being created in God’s image. God our Father has ears with which to hear our prayers. He has eyes with which to see our actions. He has a mouth with which to speak to us. He has a heart with which to feel compassion and love. He is real. He is living. We are his children, made in his image. We look like him, and he looks like us. (“ I Know That My Redeemer Lives ,” Ensign , Apr. 1990, 6) Why do you think it would be important to place your identity as a child of God above any other identity you have? Give students time to ponder how important their identity as children of God currently is to them. Doing so can invite the Holy Ghost to testify of truth or help prepare students’ minds and hearts to be taught. What obstacles could make it difficult to believe or remember your identity as a child of God, created in His image? Consider writing student responses to the previous question on the board. Possible answers could be that some people might not understand why being a child of God matters, they struggle to feel God’s love, or they are distracted by less-important identifiers. If students have questions about gender, follow the Savior’s example as you teach His doctrine in a way that brings understanding, hope, and healing. Testify that God loves all His children and will help students navigate their questions as they apply the principles of acquiring spiritual knowledge. For an idea on how to help students with questions about gender, see the Supplemental Learning Activities . Words of scriptures and prophets Provide students with the handout titled “ I Am a Child of God .” Invite students to seek inspiration from God as they study to help them recognize the significance of their divine identity. In addition to the handout, you could invite students to review the teachings found in the Young Women and Aaronic Priesthood themes. Students could do this individually or in small groups. Open PDF When students have finished studying, you could invite them to share what they learned with the class or in small groups. You could also ask questions such as the following: What did you find from the resources you studied that was meaningful to you? How can knowing your identity as a child of God affect the way you see yourself and others? How has the knowledge of your divine identity and potential impacted your life? If students would benefit from seeing an example of how knowing their eternal identity can affect them, consider watching “ Running Toward the Light ” (17:34), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 11:00 to 15:19. In this video, Elder Peter M. Johnson of the Seventy shared his experience of learning that he is a child of God and the influence that knowledge has had on his life. After the video, you could invite a few students to share what impressed them from Elder Johnson’s message. 17:34 Reflect on your identity Give students time to reflect on what they have learned about their identity and potential as daughters and sons of heavenly parents. Invite them to record in their study journals any impressions or insights they have received that they would like to remember. Consider concluding by singing “ I Am a Child of God ” as a class, then sharing your testimony about being a child of God. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Genesis 1:26–27 is “God created man in his own image.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 9 ---\nAfter the creation of Adam and Eve, Heavenly Father joined them together in marriage. He commanded them to multiply and replenish the earth and to cleave to one another. This lesson can help students understand the central role of marriage and family in Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. Student preparation: Invite the students to study “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” looking for teachings that describe why family is central to Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. Possible Learning Activities When discussing the importance of marriage and family in Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation, recognize that many students do not currently experience ideal family situations. Be sensitive to the needs and questions of students. Things that are central Consider writing on the board one or more incomplete sentences that illustrate how an object, activity, person, and so on could be central to accomplishing something. The following examples may be useful. Invite the students to think about how they would fill in the blanks, then ask various students to share their answers with the class. It may be helpful to explain that the word central could also mean essential or most important . is central to succeeding in school because . is a central part of a happy life because . plays a central role in my life because . After students have shared their responses, display the following statement from “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” and invite a student to read it aloud. Ask the class to look for a central aspect of our Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ” states: We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children. (“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” Gospel Library) Why do you think marriage and family play such important roles in Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation? In what ways can you see Satan working to attack marriages and families in our day? Invite students to think about some of the questions they or others may have about marriage and family. They could write their questions in their study journals. Encourage them as they study today to look for truths and to pay attention to spiritual impressions that can help guide them in finding answers to these questions. Teachings from the scriptures Explain that what Heavenly Father did after the earth’s Creation can help us understand the central role of marriage and family in His plan. Display the following instructions and resources, and give students time to study them. You could study these together as a class, or you could organize the students into groups to study and discuss these resources together. As students read the verses from Genesis 2 , you may want to explain that the words help meet in verse 18 refers to “a helper suited to, worthy of, or corresponding to” Adam (see footnote 18b). You could also explain that the account of Eve being created from Adam’s rib is symbolic and can represent the equal partnership between husband and wife (see Russell M. Nelson, “ Lessons from Eve ,” Ensign , Nov. 1987, 87). Study the following statement and scriptures, looking for evidence of the importance of marriage and family to God. President Spencer W. Kimball (1895–1985) taught: The Lord … [brought] together Adam and Eve, his first male and first female on this earth, and perform[ed] a holy marriage ceremony to make them husband and wife. ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 192 ) Scriptures to study: Genesis 1:27–28 (God’s commandment to Adam and Eve) Genesis 2:18, 21–24 (Creation of Eve) Genesis 2:24 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Doctrine and Covenants 49:15–17 (The Lord’s teachings through the Prophet Joseph Smith) What truths did you find that demonstrate the importance of marriage and family to God? Students may identify truths similar to the following: God has commanded husbands and wives to have children ( Genesis 1:28 ). Husband and wife are to be one and act as equal partners ( Genesis 2:18, 24 ). Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God ( Doctrine and Covenants 49:15 ). The earth was created to provide a place where God’s children could be born into families and progress together ( Doctrine and Covenants 49:16–17 ). As part of your discussion of these truths, it may be helpful to discuss the following statement by President Russell M. Nelson. President Russell M. Nelson emphasized the important role families would play after the earth had been created by God: Grand as it is, planet Earth is part of something even grander—that great plan of God. Simply summarized, the earth was created that families might be. Scripture explains that a husband and wife “shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation” [ Doctrine and Covenants 49:16 ]. (“ The Creation ,” Ensign , May 2000, 85) How can remembering the central role of marriage and family in God’s plan affect the choices you make in your life? How can these truths and teachings help us respond when we see the doctrine of marriage or family being criticized or minimized? How do you think following Heavenly Father’s standards related to marriage and family can help you become more like Him? Create a response To help the students explain what they have learned about the importance of marriage and family in God’s plan, consider sharing a scenario like the following. You can adapt this scenario to be more relevant to your culture and your students’ lives. After sharing the scenario, display the instructions for students to create a response. In one of Elizabeth’s school classes, a discussion took place about marriage and family. Elizabeth shared some of her views about marriage being between a man and a woman and the importance of married couples having children. Many of Elizabeth’s classmates shared opinions that were very different from hers. After class, a young man named Isaac, who is also in Elizabeth’s seminary class, asked Elizabeth why she had such outdated opinions about marriage and family. Using what you have learned today, create a response that Elizabeth could share with Isaac. Include the following in your response: An explanation about why marriage and family are important to Heavenly Father and His plan of salvation One or more teachings from the scriptures or Church leaders An invitation Elizabeth could share with Isaac that could help him After the students have had time to prepare, give them an opportunity to share their responses. They could share them with a partner or small group. A few willing students could also be invited to share their responses with the class or to role-play the scenario. Give students time to reflect on what they learned and felt today. They could think about truths they learned that answered some of their questions. Invite them to record any spiritual impressions they have had in their study journals. Testify of the truths you have discussed today. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Genesis 2:24 is “A man … shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 10 ---\nIn the premortal life, Heavenly Father chose Jesus Christ to be the Savior in His plan. Jesus Christ consistently obeys Heavenly Father’s will, even when it is hard. This lesson can help students desire to follow Jesus Christ’s example of obeying Heavenly Father. Student preparation: Invite students to think about people they know whose examples inspire them to be more obedient to Heavenly Father. Ask them to come prepared to share. Possible Learning Activities Doing Heavenly Father’s will To begin class, consider sharing a time when a teenager was asked by Heavenly Father to do something difficult. This could be a personal experience or one you’ve heard about. The following story is one example that you could use. Encourage students to think about times when they may have had similar feelings. Brother M. Joseph Brough, formerly of the Young Men General Presidency, shared the following story about his daughter: 9:52 Young people, God requires hard things of you. One 14-year-old young woman participated in competitive basketball. She dreamed of playing high school basketball like her older sister. She then learned that her parents had been called to preside over a mission in Guatemala. Upon arrival, she discovered that a couple of her classes would be in Spanish, a language she did not yet speak. There was not a single girls’ sports team at her school. She lived on the 14th floor of a building with tight security. And to top it all off, she could not go outside alone for safety reasons. Her parents listened to her cry herself to sleep every night for months. (“ Lift Up Your Head and Rejoice ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 14) If you were in this young woman’s situation, what would have been most difficult for you? Reflect on the following questions: What is a hard thing that God has required or may require of you? How willing are you to do this hard thing? Why? What do you want to learn or feel in this lesson that could help you be more willing to do what God asks? As students study Moses 4:1–4 , they will learn about Jesus Christ and His willingness to do the hard things Heavenly Father asks. Encourage students to seek the help of the Holy Ghost to know how the Savior’s example can help them with hard things God may ask them to do. The character of Christ You may want to explain the information in the following paragraph to help students understand the context of the passage they will be studying today. We lived in the premortal life with our Heavenly Father. While there, we were taught His plan to help us become like Him. Moses 4:1–4 contains an account of the Council in Heaven when Jesus Christ was chosen to be our Savior. In these verses, we see the character of Jesus Christ and Satan as they each respond to Heavenly Father’s will in different ways. You might consider making a simple chart like the following on the board to help students clearly see differences between Jesus Christ and Satan. Jesus Christ Satan Read Moses 4:1–4 , looking for what you can learn about the motives and attitudes of Jesus Christ and Satan. Invite students to write their insights on the board and discuss what they have learned. (Students might mention how many times Satan uses the word “I” and his desire to receive honor. In contrast, they might notice the Savior’s use of the word “thy” and His desire for the glory to be the Father’s. Students might notice how Satan “rebelled against” the Father and “sought to destroy the agency of man.” In contrast, they might point out the Savior’s desire to obey the Father’s will and accept the Father’s plan.) What do these verses teach you about the relationship between Jesus Christ and His Father? One truth that students might identify during the discussion is Jesus Christ humbly obeys our Father in Heaven . The following accounts about the Savior can help students learn from His example. Help students understand that learning more about the Savior’s obedience to the Father, even when it was hard, can increase our desire to follow His example. Read the following accounts, looking for Jesus Christ’s constant desire to obey Heavenly Father, even when it was hard. Luke 2:49 (as a 12-year-old) John 8:28–29 (as an adult) Matthew 26:36–39 (in the Garden of Gethsemane) 3 Nephi 11:10–11 (as a resurrected being) Discuss with the students what they are learning about Jesus Christ from these examples. Then invite them to share other examples from the Savior’s life when He humbly obeyed the Father’s will. Invite students to recall the hard thing in their lives they thought about at the beginning of class. To help them connect what they are learning about Jesus Christ to their lives, ask questions like the following: What did Jesus Christ say or do that could inspire someone to choose to obey Heavenly Father, even when it is difficult? Who do you know who is a good example of obeying Heavenly Father’s will? What have you learned from their example? What motivates you to obey Heavenly Father’s will, even when it is hard? Following Christ’s example The young woman from the story at the beginning of the lesson is Brother Brough’s daughter. If you shared his daughter’s story, tell students that she valiantly faced the three years her parents served as mission leaders in Guatemala. Share the following continuation of her story, inviting students to look for Christlike attributes they see in her example. If you shared a different story at the beginning of class, consider sharing a follow-up, such as the story’s conclusion or another experience in the same person’s life. Invite students to look for Christlike attributes in that person. Brother Brough continued: 9:52 At the conclusion of our mission, I asked my daughter if she was going to serve a full-time mission. Her answer was “No, Dad, I have already served.” I was just fine with that! But about six months later, the Spirit awoke me in the night with this thought: “I have called your daughter to serve a mission.” My reaction was “Heavenly Father, she has given so much.” I was quickly corrected by the Spirit and came to understand that her missionary service was required of the Lord. I soon took my daughter to lunch. From across the table, I said, “Ganzie, do you know why we are here?” She said, “Yes, Dad. You know I have to serve a mission. I do not want to go, but I am going.” Because she gave her will to Heavenly Father, she served Him with all of her heart, might, mind, and strength. She has taught her father how to do a hard thing. (“ Lift Up Your Head and Rejoice ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 14) Think about the verses you read about Jesus Christ today. How did this young woman follow His example? Asking open-ended questions can help your students discover and apply gospel truths to their personal circumstances. Consider using questions like the following to allow students to express what they learned and how they can apply it to their lives. (For additional training on this, see “ Learn the doctrine of Jesus Christ for yourself ” in Teacher Development Skills .) In your study journal, write a response to the following two questions, paying attention to thoughts or impressions from the Spirit: What have you learned today about Jesus Christ that can help you obey Heavenly Father, even when He asks you to do hard things? What do you feel impressed to do because of what you have learned or felt today? Testify of Jesus Christ’s example and His ability to help us do what God has asked.\n\n\n--- Lesson 11 ---\nWhether we realize it or not, the Fall of Adam and Eve directly affects all of us each day. In fact, without it, we would not have even been born. This lesson is intended to help students understand the effects of the Fall in Heavenly Father’s plan and in their own lives. Student preparation: Invite students to memorize the doctrinal mastery passage 2 Nephi 2:25 and to ask a parent or Church leader what it means to them. Possible Learning Activities Good or bad? To begin the lesson, help students think of how some difficult things can be blessings in God’s plan. One way to do this is to use the following scale. You might choose to show pictures that depict the words students will be ranking. On a scale of 1–10 (1 = bad, 10 = good), how do you think most people would rank the following things? Hard work Trials Sorrow Death Viewing these from the eternal perspective of Heavenly Father’s plan, would you rank any of these differently? If so, why? Consider displaying an image of Adam and Eve like the one at the beginning of this lesson. You may want to leave it up for the remainder of the lesson. Many of the hardships we face in life come as a result of a choice made by our first parents, Adam and Eve. How do you think many people would rank the Fall of Adam and Eve on the scale of 1–10? Why? Ponder how well you understand the Fall of Adam and Eve and its significance in your life. Answer the following questions in your study journal: Do you feel the Fall was good or bad? How can your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ affect your answer? As you study Moses 4–5 today, seek inspiration from the Holy Ghost to help you better understand the Fall of Adam and Eve. The Holy Ghost can help you see that the Fall was part of Heavenly Father’s plan to help us progress and become more like Him. The effects of the Fall Invite students to summarize what they know about the Garden of Eden and the Fall of Adam and Eve. If they need help, invite them to search 2 Nephi 2:22–23 ; Moses 3:16–17 ; 4:6–12 , looking for details. You could also summarize by showing the Old Testament Scripture Stories video “ Adam and Eve ” (1:53), located on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 1:53 Then help students learn about the effects of the Fall on Adam, Eve, and their posterity. To help students organize what they learn, provide them with paper and display the following instructions. You could invite students to work together in pairs to complete this activity. ( Note : Lesson 21: “ Assess Your Learning 1 ” suggests that students refer to the pamphlets they create in this activity to help them explain the effects of the Fall.) Consider limiting the amount of time students take in creating their pamphlets so they will have time to experience the rest of the lesson. To help you organize what you learn about the Fall, create a pamphlet using the following instructions. Imagine you will use this pamphlet to teach others about the Fall and why it was essential in Heavenly Father’s plan. Be creative in personalizing your pamphlet. Fold the paper in half. Create a cover page with a title such as “The Fall in Heavenly Father’s Plan.” Add a drawing or picture that reminds you of the Fall, such as a fruit tree or a piece of fruit. Inside the pamphlet, title the left page “Effects of the Fall.” Study Moses 4:13–16, 22–25, 28–29 ; 5:1–4 . List or draw pictures of the effects of the Fall on God’s children. Include in your pamphlet the verses where you learned about each effect. After sufficient time, invite a few students to share their pamphlets with the class. Invite students to add to their pamphlets anything they missed. Be sure students list that Adam and Eve and their posterity would now: Feel unprepared to be in God’s presence ( Moses 4:13–16 ). Be able to have children ( Moses 4:22 ; 5:2–3 ). Experience sorrow, pain, and difficulty ( Moses 4:22–24 ). Need to work hard to live ( Moses 4:25 ; 5:1–3 ). Know good from evil ( Moses 4:28 ). Physically die ( Moses 4:25 ). Be separated from God’s presence (spiritual death) ( Moses 5:4 ). Explain that separation from God is called “spiritual death”—something we all experience. Ponder how specific effects of the Fall can help us progress toward “immortality and eternal life” ( Moses 1:39 ). How does God allowing Adam and Eve to fall show His wisdom and love for His children? Ponder which effects of the Fall you find most difficult in your life. Explain to students that they will finish their pamphlets during the next lesson as they study about the Savior’s role in overcoming the negative effects of the Fall. The essential role of the Fall The Book of Mormon prophet Lehi explained the significance of the Fall. Study 2 Nephi 2:22–25 , looking for why the Fall was a good thing. What did you learn about the Fall? Students may mention a number of truths, but make sure they understand that the Fall was essential to our progression in Heavenly Father’s plan . You may also want to help your students see that Heavenly Father enabled Adam and Eve and their posterity to experience joy through the Fall. Invite them to write “joy” on their pamphlet under “Effects of the Fall.” Consider asking if any of your students can recite 2 Nephi 2:25 from memory. President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained why the Fall is essential in our lives: The Fall was an essential part of Heavenly Father’s divine plan. Without it no mortal children would have been born to Adam and Eve, and there would have been no human family to experience opposition and growth, moral agency, and the joy of resurrection, redemption, and eternal life. ( Christ and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of the Book of Mormon [1997], 207) Look back at the “Effects of the Fall” page in your pamphlet. How has your eternal progress been positively influenced because of the Fall? Which of the effects of the Fall do we need to be rescued from? Help students understand that, among other things, we cannot rescue ourselves from physical death or spiritual death. Read the first sentence in 2 Nephi 2:26 , looking for good news for all of God’s children. What did you find? Inform students that the next lesson will focus on the role of the Messiah in redeeming us from the negative effects of the Fall. Invite students to recall the ranking activity from the beginning of the lesson. Ask them how they would now rank the Fall of Adam and Eve on a scale of 1–10. Students could then explain to their neighbor why the Fall was a good thing and how it affects their lives and their progress in Heavenly Father’s plan. Consider closing with your testimony of Heavenly Father’s wisdom and love for us, which He demonstrated by sending His Son to redeem us from the Fall. (Remind students to keep their pamphlets—or turn them in to you—so they can finish creating them in the next lesson.)\n\n\n--- Lesson 12 ---\nThe Fall of Adam and Eve introduced challenges that they had not experienced in the Garden of Eden. They were separated from the presence of God and would now experience sin, physical death, and other mortal difficulties. However, our loving Father in Heaven provided a Savior to overcome the effects of the Fall. This lesson can help students feel the joy of redemption from the Fall through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to look for the effects of the Fall of Adam and Eve all around them. These could include birth, death, physical bodies, sin, hunger, sickness, and so on. Ask students to ponder how Jesus Christ can help with each effect they identify. Possible Learning Activities Our need for a Redeemer Begin class by helping students understand our need for the Atonement of Jesus Christ. One way you could do this is by using the following idea, adapted from the talk “ The Atonement of Jesus Christ ” (Tad R. Callister, Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 85). Display a picture of someone falling out of an airplane, and invite students to discuss the following: Imagine you fell out of an airplane, thousands of feet in the air, without a parachute or any other equipment. What might you do to try to slow your fall? What hope would you have of survival? In contrast, imagine that before you fell out of the plane, a friend was able to put a parachute on you. How would you feel differently about your fall? How would you feel about your friend? To help students connect the previous discussion to our need for the Atonement of Jesus Christ, they could discuss the following questions with a partner. If students created pamphlets about the effects of the Fall in the previous lesson , you could first invite them to briefly review these pamphlets. If students did not create pamphlets, you might modify the activities that reference them. How could we compare this analogy to the Fall of Adam and Eve and the role of Jesus Christ’s Atonement in Heavenly Father’s plan? What are some of the effects of the Fall that we need the help of Jesus Christ to overcome? As needed, remind students that because of the Fall, we all experience spiritual death. This means that we are born into a world separated from God’s presence and that we commit sin, which also spiritually separates us from Him. Because of the Fall, we also face difficulties, sicknesses, weaknesses, and eventually physical death. Invite students to ponder the following: Which of the following statements are true of you? I don’t know why I need the Savior. I understand why I need the Savior, but don’t think I could explain it to someone else. I could explain our need for the Savior to someone else. I feel love and gratitude for Jesus Christ and what He has done for me. Encourage students to invite the Holy Ghost’s influence by actively participating throughout the lesson. The Atonement of Jesus Christ As part of the Fall, Adam and Eve had to leave the Garden of Eden. The Lord continued to bless them by providing clothing (see Moses 4:27 ) and giving commandments to help them overcome the Fall. Consider displaying the image at the beginning of this lesson and reading the following verses as a class. Pause occasionally to invite students to share what they are learning. For example, after reading verses 5–7 , they might discuss how offering the firstlings of their flocks symbolized the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Or you could ask students what they learn from Adam’s example of obedience and how they could apply this example to their own lives. Read Moses 5:5–9 , looking for what God commanded. What did Adam and Eve learn from the angel and the Holy Ghost? Students could identify that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can be redeemed from the Fall . Consider inviting students to mark words or phrases in verses 7 and 9 that teach this truth. You might explain that redeemed means to be rescued or freed . To help students deepen their understanding of this truth, display the following instructions and provide students with the handout below. You could place students in groups of three and invite each student within the group to study a different section of the handout. Students could then share with their groups what they learned and create the next page in their pamphlets together. ( Note : Lesson 21: “ Assess Your Learning 1 ” suggests that students refer to the pamphlets they create in this activity to help them explain the role of Jesus Christ as our Redeemer.) Inside your pamphlet, label the right (blank) page “The Atonement of Jesus Christ.” Study the material on the handout to learn how the Atonement of Jesus Christ redeems us from the effects of the Fall. You may have listed the effects of the Fall on the previous page of your pamphlet. On the new page of your pamphlet, write one or two sentences summarizing what you learn from each section of the handout. Seek help from the Holy Ghost to recognize how these teachings relate to you. Open PDF Consider inviting a few students to share what they wrote in their pamphlets. The other students could add what they learn from their classmates to their pamphlets. The joy of redemption Invite students to label the back cover of their pamphlets “The Joy of My Redemption.” Encourage them to copy the following statement onto that page, leaving room to write under it. President Russell M. Nelson taught: When we can feel the Savior’s Atonement working in our lives, we will be filled with joy. (“ Joy and Spiritual Survival ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2016, 84) Read Moses 5:10–11 , looking for what Adam and Eve observed about the results of both the Fall and the Savior’s Atonement. What stands out to you from their words? Give students time to complete the final page of their pamphlets, which they could do by writing a personalized version of Moses 5:10–11 . Like Adam and Eve, they could write reasons they have for feeling joy because of their Redeemer. Consider concluding by inviting a few students to share what they wrote.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 13 ---\nWhen Enoch was called to preach repentance to a wicked group of people, he felt inadequate. The Lord helped and strengthened him to accomplish what he thought he could not do. This lesson can help students feel confidence in the Lord and His power to help and strengthen them. Student preparation: Invite students to think of times people experienced the Lord’s power as he helped them overcome difficulties. Encourage them to look for examples in the scriptures. Possible Learning Activities Feelings of inadequacy Consider displaying statements such as the following on the board: I can’t. I’m not good enough. It’s too hard. What are situations where teenagers might experience these kinds of feelings? You might make a list on the board of the situations that students share. Think about a situation in your own life that might be causing you to feel inadequate or overwhelmed. Take a moment and ponder this question: How confident do you feel that the Lord will help you in this situation? Encourage students to think about their own situations as they study Enoch’s call to be a prophet. Invite them to seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to increase their confidence in the Lord’s ability to help and strengthen them. Enoch experiences the Lord’s power A few generations after Adam, one of his descendants, Enoch, lived among hard-hearted and wicked people. Read Moses 6:26–28 , looking for what the Lord called Enoch to do. How might you have felt if you were Enoch? Why? To help students study Enoch’s experience with the Lord, consider using the handout titled “Enoch Experiences the Lord’s Power.” Students could work through the handout with a partner. For variety, they could switch partners after each study activity. You could also use the ideas on the handout to help the students study Enoch’s experience together as a class. Some students struggle with knowing how to begin a gospel-focused conversation. Included in the handout are some discussion questions. Providing discussion questions like these can help students practice sharing their thoughts and feelings about what they study in the scriptures or the words of prophets. (For additional training on discussions, see “ Encourage learners to share the truths they are learning ” in Teacher Development Skills .) Open PDF Give students time to share what they learned from their study and discussion, including truths they identified in Study Activity 4. Using their own words, students may have identified a truth similar to the following: If we faithfully do as the Lord commands, He will give us help and strength. The Lord’s help and strength in your life To help students understand the above principle, you could display some scriptural or modern examples. Invite students to read (or watch) the example and prepare to share how the Lord helped and strengthened the people in the example. Examples could include Nephi and his family in the wilderness (see 1 Nephi 5:7–8 ; 7:16–18 ; 17:1–3 ; 18:1–4 ), Alma and his people in bondage (see Mosiah 24:10–22 ), or the Prophet Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:1–10 ; 122:7–9 ). You could also consider showing the example President Russell M. Nelson shared from his life in “ Becoming True Millennials ” (time code 9:05 to 12:29). This video is available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 30:29 How have you seen or experienced the Lord’s power to give help and strength in your life? Consider sharing your own personal experiences with the Lord’s power. Reflect on what you learned Give students time to reflect on what they have learned and felt today from the scriptures, each other, and the Spirit. One way you could do this is to display the following question and give students time to record their answers in their study journals. What have I learned or felt today about the Lord that can help me when I feel inadequate, discouraged, or not strong enough? Consider inviting a few willing students to share what they wrote with the class. Testify of the Savior and His power to give us strength and help.\n\n\n--- Lesson 14 ---\nJesus Christ is at the center of our Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. He invites all to come unto Him by living His doctrine. This lesson can help students understand how to come unto Jesus Christ and receive blessings only He and His Father can offer. Student preparation: Invite students to ask a family member or friend why Jesus Christ is significant to them and what it means to them to come unto Him. Possible Learning Activities Come unto Christ Consider displaying a picture of Jesus Christ, such as the one found at the beginning of the lesson. Then share the following scenario. Imagine you have a friend who is unfamiliar with Jesus Christ. Your friend asks you who Jesus Christ is and why He matters to you. Give students time to think about how they might respond. Then invite them to share their thoughts in small groups or with the class. If you only had a small amount of time to respond, what would you want your friend to know about Jesus Christ? Why? Remind students of Enoch’s call to preach repentance to a wicked group of people (see Moses 6:27–29 ). Explain that today’s lesson will focus on his teachings to those people. Enoch’s message centered on our need for Jesus Christ and how we can come unto Him. To help students reflect on their need for the Savior, consider displaying the following instructions and giving students time to silently evaluate themselves on each statement. Using a scale of 1 (not true of me) to 5 (true of me), evaluate yourself using the following statements: I know why I need a Savior. I understand how I can come unto Jesus Christ. I currently want to come to and follow Jesus Christ. Regardless of how you evaluated yourself, the Savior wants you to come unto Him and receive the blessings that only He can offer you. As you study the words of the prophet Enoch today, pay attention to impressions from the Spirit to better understand why you need the Savior and how you can come unto Him. Enoch teaches his people To help students learn from Enoch’s teachings in Moses 6 , consider copying the following chart onto the board. Students could also copy the chart into their study journals. Ask the students to study the verses. Assign half of the class to look for why we need a Savior. The other half could look for how we come unto Christ. As students study, you may want to walk around and ask students if there are words or phrases they need help understanding. The following may help students understand verse 59 : We become born of the Spirit by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost (see Topics and Questions, “ Gospel Study Guide: “Gift of the Holy Ghost ,” Gospel Library). To be sanctified means to become “free from sin, pure, clean, and holy through the Atonement of Jesus Christ” (Guide to the Scriptures, “ Sanctification ,” Gospel Library). Enoch’s teachings about coming unto Christ: Moses 6:48–52, 57–59 I need a Savior because … I can come unto Christ by … After students have completed their half of the chart, give them a chance to discuss their findings. They could do this by filling out the chart on the board as a class or by sharing what they learned with a partner. What did you learn from these verses about why we need a Savior? Students who focused on why we need a Savior may share truths like we can receive the blessings of salvation only through Jesus Christ ( verse 52 ); all people everywhere need to repent ( verses 49–50, 57 ); no unclean thing can dwell in the kingdom of God ( verse 57 ). You could invite students to write the truths they found in the chart on the board. What did these verses teach you about specific actions you can take that will help you come to Jesus Christ? Students who focused on how we can come unto Christ could write what they found on the board. Their responses could be summarized into a truth like we come unto Christ as we listen to the Savior’s voice, believe in Him, repent of our sins, are baptized, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost . It may be helpful to explain that the scriptures sometimes refer to this process as the “doctrine of Christ” ( 2 Nephi 31:2–21 ), the Savior’s doctrine (see 3 Nephi 11:31–40 ), or the Savior’s gospel (see 3 Nephi 27:13–22 ). Consider inviting students to read Moses 6:62 to see another term Heavenly Father used to describe this process. You could invite students to share what they are noticing about the role of Jesus Christ in Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. What would you say to someone who wonders whether it is worth the effort it takes to come unto Christ? As part of your discussion of the previous question, it may be helpful for students to study some or all of the following verses, looking for blessings we can receive as we come unto Jesus Christ: Matthew 11:28–30 ; 2 Nephi 31:21 ; 3 Nephi 19:13–14 ; Ether 12:27 ; Moroni 10:32–33 . You might also consider inviting students to share blessings they have experienced as they have made efforts to come unto Jesus Christ. Demonstrate understanding Invite students to refer to the scenario with their friend from the beginning of the lesson. To practice explaining what they have learned, students could share their responses to the following questions in small groups. Based on what you have learned and felt today, explain the following to your friend in a way that would be easy for them to understand: Why do we need Jesus Christ? What can we do to come unto Him? Consider concluding the lesson by inviting students to record thoughts or spiritual impressions they have had in their study journals. You could share what you have learned about the need for Jesus Christ and testify how coming unto Him has blessed your life.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 16 ---\nGod called Enoch as a prophet to preach the message of the gospel. The people who chose to follow Enoch gathered together, and the Lord protected them from the wickedness around them. They eventually formed a joyful and holy city the Lord called “Zion” ( Moses 7:18 ). This lesson can help students develop the Christlike attributes that Enoch and his people had. Student preparation: Invite students to think about their previous day and the effect their actions might have had on other people. Possible Learning Activities Strength through interconnected roots Think of a way to begin the lesson by helping students recognize the strength that can come from unity with others. The following is one way you could do this. How tall do you think the tallest type of tree can grow? The tallest trees in the world are redwood trees. They can grow more than 300 feet (92 m) high. To support such a tall tree, what do you think the roots of a redwood are like? Surprisingly, the roots of redwoods are only about 3–6 feet (1–2 m) deep. However, these roots spread out several hundred feet (more than 100 m) and become intertwined with the roots of other trees. This interconnectedness enables redwoods to stand strong for hundreds of years amid winds and floods (see Richard H. Winkel, “ Web of Friendship ,” New Era , Aug. 2003, 10–11). What do you think we can learn from redwoods that could influence our families, schools, and wards or branches? Why do you think the Lord would want us to find strength with others around us as well as in Him? To help students assess how well-connected they feel to the people around them, invite the students to answer the following questions in their study journals: How do others help and support you, especially in your efforts to come closer to the Savior? (This could be in your family, ward or branch, friend groups, community, and so on.) How do you try to support others and help them feel closer to the Savior? As students study this lesson, invite them to be sensitive to impressions of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost can teach them how they might increase the strength they feel with God and with the people around them. Strength in Zion In a vision, the Lord called the prophet Enoch to preach repentance and baptism to several cities. The people who followed Enoch gathered together. Read Moses 7:13, 16–17 , looking for the contrast between the people who were striving to follow the Lord and the people who fought against them. What impressed you about the blessings the Lord gave to the people who strove to follow Him? To better understand what distinguished the Lord’s people, read Moses 7:18–21 . (It may be helpful to point out that to be cursed means to have blessings withheld because of unrighteousness. See also “ Curse, Curses ” in Guide to the Scriptures.) Moses 7:18 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Help students understand what they studied. To do so, you could invite them to draw in their journals a simple representation of what they learned from verse 18 . Students could then share what they drew and why they drew it with partners, small groups, or the class. What do you learn about the Lord’s people from verse 18 ? What do you think it means to be “of one heart and one mind”? Help students identify a truth similar to the Lord’s people strive to be unified, live righteously, and care for the poor among them. You might point out that these are also characteristics of the Savior. Becoming the Lord’s people means becoming more like Him. Becoming the Lord’s people To help students better understand how to be unified, live righteously, and care for people in need, consider asking students to work through the following handout in small groups. They can strive to help and support each other throughout the activity. Below are two ways you might use the handout: Invite students to divide the sections of the handout between their group members and to study their section on their own. After completing their section, students could share what they learned. Tape copies of the sections of the handout on the walls and invite the small groups to move around the room completing each section together. Open PDF Invite multiple students to share what they learned or studied that was meaningful to them. You also might ask how working in groups increased students’ understanding. How did the Savior exemplify the characteristics of Zion during His life? To illustrate an example of the Christlike attributes of Zion, you might share the video “ Charity: An Example of the Believers ” (4:50), found on Gospel Library. Consider inviting students to look for how these young women exemplified Zion. 4:50 Make a plan Invite students to think about impressions they may have had during the lesson and to record answers to the following questions in their study journals: What is one Christlike attribute of Zion you feel you could improve in your life? (This could be at home, at church, or with others.) What is something you will begin to do this week to strengthen that Christlike attribute? (This could be a part of your goals for the Children and Youth program.) Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for “ Moses 7:18 ” is “The Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix under “Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities.”\n\n\n--- Lesson 17 ---\nWhen have you felt of God’s mercy in your life? The Lord showed Enoch a vision of the earth’s history from his own day to the Millennium. Enoch learned in a profound way about Heavenly Father’s personal love for His children. This lesson can help students feel God’s mercy and love for all His children. Student preparation: Invite students to think of experiences and scriptures that help them know what Heavenly Father is like. They could also ask parents or trusted leaders or friends to share experiences or scriptures with them. Invite students to come prepared to share. Possible Learning Activities Struggling to feel God’s mercy and love To prepare students to learn more about God and His character, read or display the following scenarios: Caleb wonders whether God only cares about people who are doing what’s right. Zoe worries God may be angry about the choices someone close to her is making. She worries He may want to punish them. Olivia doesn’t think she’s ever felt God’s love. Why might these people feel this way? Select one of these scenarios to ponder as you continue this lesson. To help students be receptive to the influence of the Holy Ghost throughout this lesson, encourage them to ponder the following questions: What do you know about Heavenly Father that could help you if you had similar concerns? What questions do you have about Heavenly Father? Seek help from the Lord to know and feel His love for you and for all His children. Enoch’s vision of those who were not taken into heaven Consider summarizing the following in your own words: Recall that through the help and guidance of the Lord, Enoch established the city of Zion. The people of Zion were unified in the Lord, lived in righteousness, and cared for one another (see Moses 7:16–19 ). In a vision, the Lord showed Enoch that He would take the people of Zion into heaven because of their faith and righteousness (see Moses 7:20–21 ). Enoch also “beheld the residue of the people” ( Moses 7:22 ), referring to those people who were left on the earth because they would not follow the Savior. Read Moses 7:23–26 , looking for what Enoch saw. What do you learn about Satan? Why do you think it is important to understand these things about Satan? Enoch sees how God reacts to wickedness Enoch then had a tender experience as he watched God look upon the people who had chosen not to obey Him. You may want to explain that Enoch saw Jehovah, or Jesus Christ. Ever since the Fall of Adam, Jehovah is who appears to and speaks with prophets. On these occasions, He often speaks as if He were the Father. The unity of the Father and Son is such that the Savior’s feelings also represent the Father. Therefore, what students will study of this vision between Enoch and Jehovah can also help them learn about Heavenly Father. As students read the following verses, you might encourage them to read slowly, pause to ponder what they read, and maybe read the verses more than once. Reading in this way can help students invite the Spirit to teach them more about their Heavenly Father. Read Moses 7:28–33 and mark words or phrases that help you know and understand Heavenly Father better. What do you learn about God from these verses? Consider writing “ God … ” on the board and ask students to finish this statement with what they learned. Encourage various responses. Some answers might include: loves us deeply ( verses 28–33 ). created the universe yet is available to us ( verse 30 ). is just, merciful, and kind ( verse 30 ). gave us agency ( verse 32 ). desires that we love one another ( verse 33 ). desires that we choose Him ( verse 33 ). As students share what they found, consider asking follow-up questions such as: Why is that truth about Heavenly Father meaningful to you? How can knowing that truth help the person in the situation you chose? How can it help you? Using Enoch’s experience, President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught that the Savior shows us what Heavenly Father is like and how much He loves us. He shared the following insight about Heavenly Father: In the midst of a grand vision of humankind which heaven opened to his view, Enoch, observing both the blessings and challenges of mortality, turns his gaze toward the Father and is stunned to see Him weeping. He says in wonder and amazement to this most powerful Being in the universe: “How is it that thou canst weep?” … That single, riveting scene does more to teach the true nature of God than any theological treatise could ever convey. … What an indelible image of God’s engagement in our lives! What anguish in a parent when His children do not choose Him nor “the gospel of God” He sent! [ Romans 1:1 ]. How easy to love someone who so singularly loves us! … I bear personal witness this day of a personal, living God, who knows our names, hears and answers prayers, and cherishes us eternally as children of His spirit. (” The Grandeur of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2003, 72) Invite students to share what stood out to them from President Holland’s statement. Consider writing the following questions on the board. Invite students to discuss the questions in small groups. Also invite them to discuss how these ideas might apply to the scenarios they chose at the beginning of the lesson. As students answer, walk around the room and listen to some of their responses. Why do you think Heavenly Father weeps for us when we do not love one another? Why might He weep for us when we do not choose to follow and love Him? What are some lies that Satan would like us to believe about God’s feelings toward us? After students have discussed these questions, consider asking what they heard from another student that would be helpful to share with the whole class. This allows students to review answers while also complimenting each other for their responses. You may also point out helpful answers you heard. Enoch sees the life and mission of the Savior The Lord then showed Enoch that the people left on the earth who would not repent would perish in a flood (see Moses 7:34–44 ). In response, Enoch wept. The Lord then comforted Enoch, saying, “Lift up your heart, and be glad; and look” ( Moses 7:44 ). Read Moses 7:44–47 , looking for what the Lord showed Enoch to comfort him. It may be helpful to know that “the Righteous” ( verses 45 and 47 ) is a title for Jesus Christ. Why do you think seeing these things would cause Enoch’s soul to rejoice? ( verse 47 ). How does sending Jesus Christ show the Father’s mercy and love? If helpful, you can discuss how the Savior will help all of God’s children, even the people who were wicked and died in the Flood. Help students understand that although the wicked perished in the Flood and would have to suffer for their sins in the spirit world, they could still repent through the Savior (see Moses 7:38–39 ; 1 Peter 3:18–20 ). Feeling God’s love To conclude, invite students to seek help through the Holy Ghost as they do the following activity. Alternatively, students could write to someone in their lives who may need to feel Heavenly Father’s mercy and love. Write a letter to help the person in the scenario you chose at the beginning of the lesson. As part of your letter, include the following: What you learned from Moses 7 about Heavenly Father’s mercy and love. Include specific phrases or verses you feel would be especially meaningful. Other scriptures or experiences that have helped you feel God’s mercy and love. Additional ideas you think may help this person feel God’s love. Conclude by inviting students to share their thoughts, experiences, and feelings. Consider adding your own testimony of the Father’s love.\n\n\n--- Lesson 18 ---\nOne of the Savior’s titles is “the King of Zion” ( Moses 7:53 ). He watches over His people, and in the last days He will preserve them from the great tribulations that will occur. This lesson can help students recognize and appreciate what the Lord has done to help them overcome the trials of our time. Student preparation: Invite students to come prepared to share a passage from the Book of Mormon that has helped them when they have faced trials. Possible Learning Activities Great tribulations in the last days Invite students to imagine a large storm is coming to your city. If useful, you could display an image of a large storm. What are some of the great trials or difficulties of the last days? How could these trials and difficulties be compared to a storm? What are some ways to seek safety from these storms? Invite students to ponder their feelings about these storms and their efforts to find safety. The following self-assessment is one way you could do this: Ponder how true the following statements are of you: I know what the Lord has done to help me with the storms (trials and difficulties) that I face. I appreciate what the Lord has done and sincerely want His help. Invite students to seek inspiration from the Holy Ghost as they study. The Holy Ghost can teach about ways the Lord can help the students with the storms they face. The King of Zion Enoch and his people built “the City of Holiness, even Zion” ( Moses 7:19 ). The Lord promised they would “dwell in safety forever” ( Moses 7:20 ). Enoch then saw and wept over the destruction that would come during the Flood. Seeking comfort, Enoch asked if the Lord would have mercy on the people who came after the Flood. In response, the Lord taught about and showed Enoch the Savior and His Atonement (see Moses 7:42–57 ). Read Moses 7:53 , looking for how the Savior described Himself. How could the things the Lord shared in this verse comfort Enoch? Invite students to mark and discuss the various titles and roles of Jesus Christ in verse 53 . This lesson will focus on His title “King of Zion.” You might ask follow-up questions about this title such as: How is Jesus Christ like a powerful and loving king to us? What other phrases from this verse describe blessings you would want from following the King of Zion? Consider reminding students that Zion is made up of anyone who, like Enoch’s people, are “the pure in heart” ( Doctrine and Covenants 97:21 )—people who are like the Lord. The Lord will preserve His people Enoch asked the Lord if He would come again to the earth. The Lord showed Enoch the last days and the things He would do for the people who strive to follow Him. Read Moses 7:60–61 , looking for what the Lord promised to do. What do you think it means for the Lord to “preserve” the people that strive to follow Him? As students read Moses 7:62 as directed below, you may want to help them see how active God is in preserving His people. One way to do this is to invite students to pay attention to every use of the word I and to the verbs that follow it. You may also invite them to notice when the Lord uses my or mine and what words these are associated with. Though Enoch had seen in vision the devastating flood in the days of Noah, the Lord then showed Enoch ways He would gather people to Him and preserve them. Read Moses 7:62 , looking for what the Lord will do to preserve His people. What are some of the things the Lord will do to preserve His people? Write the following phrase on the board: To preserve His people in the last days, the Lord will … As students answer, write the following phrases on the board : send righteousness out of heaven. send truth out of the earth. gather His people to Zion (see also Doctrine and Covenants 115:6 ). What are some ways that the Lord is fulfilling this prophecy in our time? Righteousness out of heaven and truth out of the earth to gather us to Zion To help students understand the three different aspects of this truth, you might write “Righteousness out of heaven,” “Truth out of the earth,” and “Zion” each on the board in separate columns. The following are sentences and images connected to each aspect. Write each sentence on a separate sheet of paper or display the images. Students could then match the sentence or image to one of the headings on the board. Righteousness out of heaven Joseph Smith received the First Vision. John the Baptist gave the Aaronic Priesthood to Joseph Smith. Peter, James, and John gave the Melchizedek Priesthood to Joseph Smith. The Lord revealed the Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord reveals His word through modern-day prophets. Truth out of the earth Joseph Smith obtained and translated the gold plates. Zion We are all part of a ward or branch. Help students ponder the importance of what the Lord has done. One way you could do this is by inviting students to complete the following in their study journals. If you used the previous activity, students could select something from the list on the board. Identify two ways the Lord is preserving His people from the tribulations of our time and answer the following questions. If possible, think of a specific example. You might mention an experience with the priesthood, a passage from the Book of Mormon, an experience in your ward or branch, and so on. How has this example helped you come to know the Savior better? How has it or could it help with the difficulties of the last days? Invite several students to share their responses. Look for ways to help students recognize and appreciate all the Lord has done to help them with the trials and difficulties of the last days. One way you can do this is to listen carefully to what students say and state what it can teach us about the character and nature of the Lord.

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 19 ---\nThe Lord called Noah to be a prophet at a time when the people were described as “being only evil continually” ( Moses 8:22 ). Even amid so much wickedness, Noah and his sons chose to follow Jesus Christ. This lesson can help students better follow the Savior despite living in a wicked world. Student preparation: Invite students to think about challenges or difficulties they face in following Jesus Christ in the world today. Ask them to come to class prepared to share what has helped them overcome the world and follow Jesus Christ. Possible Learning Activities Living in, but not of, the world Begin class by showing students a bucket of water and a small dry object. Is it possible for an object to remain dry if it’s placed in a bucket of water? How? After students have had an opportunity to share their thoughts, place the object in a plastic bag or a sealed container, and place it in the bucket of water. How might this object lesson relate to our efforts to remain righteous in a wicked world? To help students evaluate their current ability to live righteously in a wicked world, consider displaying the following statements. Invite students to ponder how true each statement is for them. It’s hard for me to resist the enticements of the world and follow Jesus Christ. I know where I can turn for help to remain faithful in a wicked world. I spend time daily seeking to learn more about and to follow Jesus Christ. Remind students that the Holy Ghost will show us what we should do (see 2 Nephi 32:5 ). Invite students to seek inspiration to know what they can do to remain righteous in an increasingly wicked world. A wicked world When the Lord took Enoch and his city into heaven (see Moses 7:69 ), Enoch’s righteous son, Methuselah, remained on the earth (see Moses 8:2 ). Methuselah’s grandson, Noah, and Noah’s three sons “walked with God” ( Moses 8:27 ), while most people who remained on the earth chose wickedness. Display the following instructions and chart on the board. Invite students to draw the chart in their study journals. Students could complete the chart in small groups. Read Moses 8:12–22, 28–29 , looking for the spiritual condition of the people in Noah’s day. Then identify similarities between the spiritual conditions in Noah’s day and conditions we see in our day. Spiritual Condition of Many in Noah’s Day Similarities between Noah’s Day and Our Day Invite groups to share what they found with other groups. Encourage students to add what their classmates share to their own charts. If students need help, you could point out similarities like the following: 1. Like Noah’s granddaughters, some people today forfeit blessings God offers them through eternal, covenant marriage (see verses 12–15 ). 2. Some people today also fight against the prophet and reject his counsel (see verses 18–20 ). Review Moses 8:16–17 to see what the Lord told Noah would happen if the people didn’t repent. How much time did the Lord give the people to repent? What can that teach us about the nature of God? Following the Savior in a wicked world To help students feel hope that they can follow the Savior in a wicked world, consider inviting a student to read the following statement. President Russell M. Nelson shared how overcoming this fallen world is possible: Because Jesus Christ overcame this fallen world, and because He atoned for each of us, you too can overcome this sin-saturated, self-centered, and often exhausting world. (“ Overcome the World and Find Rest ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 96) What would you use from President Nelson’s statement to help someone who feels overwhelmed by the wickedness around them? Consider writing the following incomplete statement of truth on the board. Invite students to begin thinking about different ways they could complete it. I can choose to follow the Savior in a wicked world by … To help students discover ways they can follow the Savior in a wicked world, provide them with instructions below and copies of the accompanying handout. Students could work in groups. They could study the resources together, or group members could select different scripture passages and statements to study separately and then come together to discuss. Choosing from the following resources, make a list in your study journal of things we can do to follow Jesus Christ despite the wickedness and temptations around us. Open PDF After groups have had sufficient time to study and create lists, consider having each group write on the board one thing they found to complete the statement of truth. For example, from Moses 8:13, 23–24 , students might find listening to the Lord and His prophets, believing in Jesus Christ, repenting, and making covenants with God. A few students could share why the things they wrote were significant to them. Consider showing the video “ Sharing Your Light ” (2:56), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . In this video, a young woman follows the Savior despite the choices of others around her. 2:56 Pausing and reflecting on students’ unique backgrounds can invite a Christlike spirit of discernment, love, and empathy into your interactions with them. For example, based on their life experiences, some students may respond to the following questions differently than you would. Seek to understand their point of view, react with love and empathy, and compliment their efforts to follow the Savior. (For additional training on increasing your understanding of students’ unique circumstances, see “ Seek to know them—understand their circumstances, needs, and strengths ” in Teacher Development Skills.) Ponder what you have done to help you overcome the wickedness around you. These actions might be the small and simple things you do regularly, goals you’ve worked on in the Children and Youth program, or other experiences. What have you done to help you better follow the Savior and overcome the wickedness around you? Were there any obstacles you faced in your efforts? If so, what did you do or could you do to overcome those obstacles? What advice would you have for others? My plan to follow Jesus Christ Help students think of ways they can follow Jesus Christ. You could do this by inviting them to respond to the following questions. You might encourage students to write their answers somewhere they will see them often or to share their plan with trusted friends, family members, or Church leaders. These suggestions can remind students what they’ve learned and want to do. What have you felt inspired to do today? How will following these impressions increase your ability to follow the Savior and overcome the world? Consider concluding with student testimonies about what they have learned and felt today and about how following the Savior can help them overcome the world. You might also share your testimony.\n\n\n--- Lesson 20 ---\nGod lovingly asks us to obey His commandments. Some commandments may be difficult to understand, but they are always for our good. Noah’s family was saved from an unprecedented, miraculous flood because they obeyed God’s commandment to build an ark. This lesson can help students increase their desire to obey God’s commandments. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder and come prepared to share how a specific commandment shows Heavenly Father’s love for us and His desire to protect us. Possible Learning Activities Commandments of God Consider beginning the lesson by encouraging students to ponder why our loving Father in Heaven gives us commandments. One way to do this is to display the following pictures and to create a discussion using the questions below. Another way is to have students share rules their parents have set to keep their children safe. Imagine you are caring for a large group of young children in this campground. What specific rules might you give the children to keep them safe? If the children were mad at you for setting rules, what would you explain to them? Invite students to share with a partner how they might compare this situation to Heavenly Father’s commandments for us. Then invite students to record their personal feelings about God and His commandments in their study journals using prompts like the following. You might invite a few volunteers to share what they wrote. Why do you think that God wants you, personally, to keep His commandments? How willing are you to obey what God asks, even if you don’t understand the reason for the commandment? Why? The people in Noah’s day Consider displaying the image of Noah at the beginning of the lesson. Ask students to share what they already know about the following concepts. Invite them to use the suggested scripture passages if needed. The spiritual condition of the people in Noah’s day and what God did as a result (see Moses 8:17, 20, 22, 28–29 ) What God commanded Noah to do to save the obedient (see Moses 7:43 ) As students continue to study, encourage them to seek the influence of the Holy Ghost to understand God’s love for us. Everything God does, including the Flood, is motivated by love (see 2 Nephi 26:24 ). Help students recognize that Jesus Christ suffered for the sins of the people who died in the Flood so that they could learn and repent in the spirit world (see Moses 7:38–40 ; 1 Peter 3:18–20 ). Also, God’s choice to send the Flood protected His other spirit children from being born into such dangerous and wicked circumstances (see John Taylor, in Journal of Discourses , 19:158–59). The ark Consider providing paper for small groups of students and giving them a short time to complete the following activity together. (Be careful to save time after this activity for students to discuss what they learn and to relate it to their lives.) Read Genesis 6:14–22 ; 7:1–12, 23 ; 8:13–17 , looking for what this account teaches about God and what we can learn from Noah. Make a simple drawing of what happened. Include with your drawing one thing you learned about God and one thing you learned from Noah’s example. Invite groups to show and explain their drawings (even if they are incomplete) to another group. Then invite groups to share with the class what they learned about God and what they learned from Noah’s example. One truth that students might identify from this account is as we obey the Lord in faith, He will bless and protect us . Consider displaying the following statement and inviting groups to read and discuss how it applies to us today. President Spencer W. Kimball (1895–1985) shared some reasons why Noah and his family needed faith in Christ to fulfill the commandment to build the ark. As yet there was no evidence of rain and flood. [Noah’s] people mocked and called him a fool. His preaching fell on deaf ears. His warnings were considered irrational. There was no precedent; never had it been known that a deluge [or flood] could cover the earth. How foolish to build an ark on dry ground with the sun shining and life moving forward as usual! ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 140–41 ) What are some of the Lord’s commandments that people ignore or mock today? What do you know about God and His prophets that can help us obey the Lord despite opposition? Invite students to share commandments that they believe are loving protections from God. Obedience to God in our lives Consider displaying the following statement along with the personal reflection prompts below. President Thomas S. Monson (1927–2018) shared one of the greatest lessons we can learn in our lives. Noah had the unwavering faith to follow God’s commandments. May we ever do likewise. May we remember that the wisdom of God ofttimes appears as foolishness to men; but the greatest lesson we can learn in mortality is that when God speaks and we obey, we will always be right. (“ Models to Follow ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2002, 61) Record in your study journal: How you feel President Monson’s statement relates to situations or commandments in your life. What you learned or felt today about Heavenly Father and His commandments. What you believe Heavenly Father would have you do to follow Noah’s example of faithful obedience. You might conclude the lesson by inviting students to mark Noah’s example in Genesis 7:5 and cross-reference it with the Savior’s premortal example in Moses 4:2 . Consider testifying that God will bless your students for their faithful efforts to follow the Savior’s example of obedience.\n\n\n--- Lesson 21 ---\nReflecting on and assessing our spiritual learning can help us draw closer to the Savior. This lesson can help students reflect on the goals they have set and the growth they have experienced during their study of Moses 1 through Genesis 11 . Student preparation: Invite students to come ready to share what they have learned or ways they have grown spiritually since beginning this year’s study of the Old Testament and Pearl of Great Price. You might suggest that they review their study journals or notes in their scriptures to help them notice their growth and learning. Possible Learning Activities Your class’s study of Moses 1 through Genesis 11 may have focused on different outcomes than those assessed in this lesson. If so, adapt the activities to assess the growth students experienced from the outcomes they focused on. In this lesson, students will have the opportunity to assess their progress in: Deepening their conversion to Jesus Christ and becoming His disciple. Studying the scriptures daily. Explaining the effects of the Fall and role of Jesus Christ as our Redeemer. (Note: This activity is based on teachings from Lesson 11: “ Moses 4:5–32; 5:1–15, Part 1 ” and Lesson 12: “ Moses 4:5–32; 5:1–15, Part 2 .”) Increasing their desire to fulfill their divine identity and purpose. (Note: This activity is based on Lesson 3: “ Abraham 3 ,” Lesson 4: “ Moses 1:1–11 ,” Lesson 5: “ Moses 1:12–26 ,” and Lesson 8: “ Genesis 1:26–27 .”) Deepening conversion to Jesus Christ and becoming His disciple To help students understand that spiritual growth takes time, consider displaying the following image of Enoch’s people. Invite students to read Moses 7:18–21 to remind them of the spiritual progress Enoch’s people made before they were taken up into heaven by the Lord. What impresses you from this description of Enoch’s people? In verse 21 , it states that “in process of time, [they were] taken up into heaven.” Read Moses 7:68 to see how long that “process of time” was. What can this teach us about spiritual growth as disciples of the Savior? Encourage students to celebrate their progress as disciples of Christ, even if it is taking longer than they would like. In time, slow and steady progress will lead to a relationship with the Savior like Enoch’s people eventually developed. Invite students to look back on their own spiritual growth and learning over the past couple months. They could try to recognize even seemingly small progress in their knowledge, desires, and actions that have helped them become more committed disciples of Jesus Christ. You might suggest that students look through their study journals or the notes in their scriptures. If it would help your students to notice their progress, you could display or ask questions like the following: What have you learned about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that is important to you? What are some ways you have come closer to Them? What is something you have applied from your scripture study to help you as a disciple of Christ? After time to ponder, invite volunteers to share progress they notice in themselves. Studying the scriptures daily You may want to remind students that reading Moses 1–5 ; Abraham 1–3 ; and Genesis 37, 39, 41 is required to receive seminary credit this semester. These chapters were carefully selected because of their doctrinal depth and richness. Additionally, students are encouraged to create a personal scripture study goal. This goal is not required for credit, but it will help them find strength daily in the word of God. If they have not yet set a goal, encourage them to do so today. They can adjust this goal anytime. To help support students in accomplishing their required reading and personal study goals, consider giving each student a small slip of paper. They will hand this paper in at the end of class. You could use the information they provide in their papers to appropriately encourage each student in their goals. You might display the following as suggestions for what to include on their papers. Your name. Required chapters you have completed. If you choose to share your personal study goal with the teacher, also include: What your goal is and how you are doing with it. How your goal is helping you learn the gospel and come to know Jesus Christ better. You could ask volunteers to share their answers to the final two prompts with the class or have students share in smaller groups. If you do this, make sure that students know that they do not need to share their scripture study goals if they do not want to. Students should never feel pressured to share. Explaining the effects of the Fall and role of Jesus Christ as our Redeemer Understanding the effects of the Fall and the role of Jesus Christ as our Redeemer from the Fall is important in understanding Heavenly Father’s plan. Yet these essential truths can be challenging to understand and explain to others. Consider giving students time to review the pamphlets they created in Lesson 11: “ Moses 4:5–32; 5:1–15, Part 1 ” and Lesson 12: “ Moses 4:5–32; 5:1–15, Part 2 .” (If students did not make pamphlets, consider displaying a piece of fruit and a picture of Jesus Christ as a simple visual way to remind students of these scripture accounts. Students could then briefly review Moses 4:6–13, 22–25 ; 5:8–12 to prepare for the discussion below.) Prepare to explain the following in your own words: Adam and Eve’s choice that caused the Fall The results of the Fall on Adam and Eve, and how those results affect all of us still today How the Fall was necessary in Heavenly Father’s plan for us What the Savior did to redeem us from specific effects of the Fall Invite students to choose a partner. Have one student explain points 1 and 2 to their partner. Then invite the other student to explain points 3 and 4. When they are finished, you might invite them to do the activity one more time, this time switching who explains which points. Increasing our desire to fulfill our divine identity and purpose During their recent study of the Old Testament, students may have had several learning experiences focused on their divine identity and purpose as children of God. Provide an opportunity for students to reflect on how the truths they have learned have impacted their desire to fulfill their divine potential. Draw an outline of a person that could represent you. Within this outline, or near it, write the truths about your divine identity that you have learned recently in the Old Testament. If possible, make these statements personal using “me” or “I.” Here are some scriptures you might refer to: Abraham 3:22–23 Moses 1:1–11 Moses 1:12–24 Genesis 1:26–27 The following are some truths students might write. They are adapted from Lessons 3, 4, 5, and 8. God chose me from among the noble and great spirits to be born today ( Abraham 3:22–23 ). As a child of God, He has a work specifically for me to do ( Moses 1:6 ). Because I am a daughter or son of God, I can find strength in Him to resist temptation ( Moses 1:13, 16 ). Because I am created in the image of God, I can become like Him ( Genesis 1:26–27 ). To help students think about how these truths can help them, you could choose one of the following activities for students to do as a class or in small groups. Or you could have students choose which activity they would like to do. Option A: Describe a few circumstances where knowing these truths could help you. Identify how these truths could help someone in each circumstance. Option B: Complete the following phrases: Knowing these truths can help me when I think about myself because … I face temptation because … I interact with others because … I make decisions because … When students have finished, invite them to record in their study journals any thoughts or experiences of how these truths have influenced their desire to fulfill their divine potential. You also might invite students to record how these truths could influence them in a future situation they will face. When students finish, invite any willing students to share something from what they wrote.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 22 ---\nAbraham grew up surrounded by wickedness and idolatry. Despite these circumstances, Abraham desired to follow Jesus Christ, who was known in the premortal life and to Abraham as Jehovah. As Abraham sought after his righteous desires, the Lord blessed him to obtain them. This lesson can help students feel hope that Heavenly Father can help them obtain blessings that He wants them to receive. Student preparation: Invite students to make a list of what they want most in life and to think about how Heavenly Father feels about what they want most. Possible Learning Activities What do you desire? Begin the lesson by helping students think of situations where they might have trouble believing that the Lord can help them obtain a righteous blessing that they desire. To do this, you could share the following incomplete scenarios and invite students to identify an obstacle that the individual might face. Samantha has a strong desire to follow Jesus Christ by preaching His gospel to other people. However, right now this seems difficult because … Yuchen has a strong desire to follow Jesus Christ by paying his tithing. However, right now this seems difficult because … Carlos has a strong desire to follow Jesus Christ by being baptized. However, right now this seems difficult because … Invite students to think about their own circumstances and the obstacles they might face to following Jesus Christ. Ask them to complete the following steps in their study journals. In your study journal: Record some of the blessings you most desire in life. List any obstacles you see to obtaining these blessings. As students study Abraham 1 , invite them to seek Heavenly Father’s help through the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost can help them feel hope that they can follow Jesus Christ and obtain His blessings no matter the obstacles they may face. Abraham’s circumstances In Lesson 3: Abraham 3 , students learned the origins of the book of Abraham. If you did not explain this in Lesson 3, you could do it now. If students have questions about the origins of the book of Abraham, you could show the video “ The Book of Abraham | Now You Know ” from time code 0:00 to 2:43. This video is located at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 5:7 It may be helpful to have students create a two-column chart. They could title the first column “Blessings Abraham desired” and the second “Obstacles Abraham faced.” This can help organize what students learn from Abraham 1:1–7 . Blessings Abraham desired Obstacles Abraham faced Blessings Abraham desired Obstacles Abraham faced Read Abraham 1:1–7 , looking for what blessings Abraham desired and what obstacles he faced to receiving those blessings. What stands out to you from the blessings Abraham desired? Why might these blessings be something you also desire? How might Abraham’s desire to follow Jesus Christ have helped him in the difficult circumstances he faced? Jehovah helped Abraham overcome his obstacles Read Abraham 1:15–20 , looking for how Jehovah helped Abraham overcome the obstacles he faced. Alternatively, you may choose to show the video “ Deliverance of Abraham ” (1:38), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 1:38 If time allows, you may want to spend some time discussing the miraculous way that Jehovah delivered Abraham. You could compare this deliverance to ways the Lord delivers us from our obstacles to righteous living. The Lord can deliver us from unhealthy habits such as excessive social media or technology use or pornography use. You could testify that Jehovah can deliver us from any obstacle that might otherwise make it difficult to follow Him. What do you think Abraham learned about Jehovah from this experience? How might Heavenly Father help us overcome obstacles to receiving righteous blessings we desire? Explain to students that after Abraham was delivered, he eventually went to Canaan. The Lord honored Abraham for acting on his desires by blessing him with the priesthood and other significant blessings. God promised Abraham these blessings as part of what we call the Abrahamic covenant. Students will learn more about this covenant in future lessons. Later in Abraham’s life, the Lord visited him and promised that He would fulfill all of Abraham’s righteous desires (see Abraham 2:9–11 ). Read Abraham 2:12–13 , looking for what Abraham said after this experience. What principles can we learn from Abraham’s experience? Students may identify a variety of principles including: If we seek to follow Jesus Christ, God will grant us the righteous blessings we desire. Read the following statement from President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, or watch the video “ A Perfect Brightness of Hope ” from time code 11:09 to 11:38. The video is located at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 17:45 Why should we not hope that righteous desires and Christlike yearnings can still be marvelously, miraculously answered by the God of all hope? We all need to believe that what we desire in righteousness can someday, someway, somehow yet be ours. (“ A Perfect Brightness of Hope ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2020, 83) Invite students to discuss the following questions in pairs or small groups, or have students record their answers in their study journals. After enough time, willing students could share one or both of their answers with the class. How do President Holland’s words and Abraham’s experience give you hope that the Lord can help you overcome obstacles to following Jesus Christ? When has Heavenly Father helped you or someone you know overcome obstacles to following Jesus Christ? Consider sharing your experience of when Heavenly Father has helped you overcome an obstacle to receiving a righteous blessing. Invite students to record what they learned today in their study journals. Consider inviting willing students to share what they wrote. Conclude by sharing your testimony of these truths.\n\n\n--- Lesson 23 ---\nThe Lord and Abraham entered a covenant that is now known as the Abrahamic covenant. As we make and keep covenants with God today, we can receive the same blessings from Him as Abraham did. This lesson can help students explain the Abrahamic covenant and how it relates to them. Student preparation: Invite students to search “ Abrahamic Covenant ” in the Gospel Library or Guide to the Scriptures, or “ Abraham, covenant of ” in the Bible Dictionary, and come prepared to share what they found. Possible Learning Activities The Abrahamic covenant Invite students to imagine they were asked to give a talk in sacrament meeting about the Abrahamic covenant. To help them assess how prepared they might be to do this, invite them to write down and answer the following questions in their study journals. What is the Abrahamic covenant? How can I receive the Abrahamic covenant? Why does the Abrahamic covenant matter to me? Assure students that it is okay if they do not know much about the Abrahamic covenant. Let them know that they will be able to add to their responses during class. Encourage them to seek confirmation from the Holy Ghost about the truthfulness of what they are learning. Note: This lesson focuses on what the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant are and why they matter to us. Lesson 24: “ Abraham 2:9–11 ” will focus on our responsibilities in the Abrahamic covenant. What is the Abrahamic covenant? Recall that Abraham desired “the blessings of the fathers” and to be a “follower of righteousness” ( Abraham 1:2 ). The Lord promised to put His name upon Abraham and to give him the priesthood (see Abraham 1:18 ). Consider creating the following chart on the board. Invite students to study the verses in the first column and list the blessings they find next to the corresponding verses on the board. They will study the verses in the second column later in the lesson. The Lord’s blessings promised to Abraham The Lord’s blessings promised to me Genesis 12:2 ; 17:1–2, 4–6 Genesis 12:3 ; 17:7 Genesis 12:7 ; 17:8 Abraham 2:11 Doctrine and Covenants 132:19–22, 30–31 Abraham 2:9–11 Doctrine and Covenants 88:18–20 Doctrine and Covenants 84:33–38 Read Genesis 12:2–3, 7 ; 17:1–8 ; Abraham 2:11 , looking for the blessings God extended to Abraham. As students read the scriptures, consider moving around the room. Some students are more likely to ask questions when a teacher is close by, so moving around the classroom while students read can make it easier for some students to ask you for help. When students have finished, invite them to share what they found. What did you find? What do these promises teach you about God? The following is a list of some of the blessings students might find: Genesis 12:2 ; 17:1–2, 4–6 : father of many nations; multiplied exceedingly; exceeding fruitful (In Hebrew, the name Abram means “exalted father,” and the name Abraham means “father of many.”) Genesis 12:3 ; 17:7 : all the families of the earth blessed by his posterity; God’s covenant to continue with Abraham’s posterity Genesis 12:7 ; 17:8 : land of Canaan Abraham 2:11 : priesthood Students may also identify the phrase “kings shall come out of thee” ( Genesis 17:6 ). This refers to the kings that would rule both Israel and Judah; but more importantly, it refers to Jesus Christ (see Matthew 1:1 ; Revelation 19:16 ). You may want to point out that the covenant God made with Abraham is known as the Abrahamic covenant. Explain that it is how God offers His greatest blessings to His children. God reaffirmed this covenant with Abraham multiple times in his life (see Genesis 13:14–17 ; 15:5, 18 ; 22:15–18 ; Abraham 2:8–12 ; 3:14 ). How can I receive the Abrahamic covenant? Share the following statement from President Nelson to help students see how the Abrahamic covenant relates to them (see also Galatians 3:27–29 ; Abraham 2:10 ). President Russell M. Nelson taught how each of us can also receive these same blessings that God promised Abraham: When we embrace the gospel and are baptized, we take upon ourselves the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Baptism is the gate that leads to becoming joint heirs to all the promises given anciently by the Lord to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their posterity. “The new and everlasting covenant” ( Doctrine and Covenants 132:6 ) and the Abrahamic covenant are essentially the same—two ways of phrasing the covenant God made with mortal men and women at different times. … … [Y]ou and I personally entered the covenant path at baptism. Then we enter it more completely in the temple. The blessings of the Abrahamic covenant are conferred in holy temples. These blessings allow us, upon being resurrected, to “inherit thrones, kingdoms, powers, principalities, and dominions, to our ‘exaltation and glory in all things’ [ Doctrine and Covenants 132:19 ].” (“ The Everlasting Covenant ,” Liahona , Oct. 2022, 4, 6) How would you summarize what we can learn from President Nelson about the blessings of Abraham? Help students identify a truth like: As we make and keep covenants with God, we become heirs to the blessings given to Abraham. Why does the Abrahamic covenant matter to me? Invite students to study the references in the second column and to list in their study journals how the blessings promised to Abraham are also promised to them. These verses might be best for students to study in pairs or small groups. The following are some of the blessings students might find: Doctrine and Covenants 132:19–22, 30–31 : eternal families (“continuation of the seeds” and “continuation of the lives”) Abraham 2:9–11 : gospel shared with all the families of the earth; salvation and exaltation Doctrine and Covenants 88:18–20 (“it” refers to the earth): inheritance in the celestial kingdom (see also Hebrews 11:8, 13–16 ) Doctrine and Covenants 84:33–38 : the blessings of the priesthood, including all that the Father has In what ways are these promised blessings meaningful to you? What do these blessings teach you about God’s feelings for you? To place the Abrahamic covenant in the context of Heavenly Father’s plan, you might want to ask students what makes it possible for us to receive the blessings they listed. You could have students ponder or share some of their thoughts. You could also share this statement from President Nelson. President Russell M. Nelson pointed out what makes it possible for us to receive the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant: The Savior’s atoning sacrifice enabled the Father to fulfill His promises made to His children. … The fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant becomes feasible because of the Atonement of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is at the center of the Abrahamic covenant. (“ The Everlasting Covenant ,” Liahona , Oct. 2022, 7). Explain the Abrahamic covenant Invite students to add to their responses from the beginning of class: What is the Abrahamic covenant? How can I receive the Abrahamic covenant? Why does the Abrahamic covenant matter to me? To solidify their understanding, consider inviting students to get into pairs and explain the Abrahamic covenant to each other. Encourage them to see if they can be brief yet complete in their responses. Explaining this covenant in as few words as possible can help students to understand it more clearly. Testify of the blessings and promises God offers us through the Abrahamic covenant.\n\n\n--- Lesson 24 ---\nThe Lord made a covenant with Abraham and his posterity. As the seed of Abraham, we have a covenant responsibility to bring the blessings of the Savior’s gospel to all the families of the earth. This lesson will help students act on the responsibilities the Lord has given them as the seed of Abraham. Student preparation: Invite students to think about the following questions and to discuss them with a family member: Why does the gospel of Jesus Christ matter to you? Why do you think all people need it?” Possible Learning Activities The seed of Abraham You could begin class by giving students 30 seconds to list as many words as they can that describe themselves. Next, ask students to circle three words that best describe them. A few students could share with the class. In what ways do these identifiers influence your behavior? Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught the following about our identity: 17:8 You may enjoy music, athletics, or be mechanically inclined, and someday you may work in a trade or a profession or in the arts. As important as such activities and occupations can be, they do not define who we are. First and foremost, we are spiritual beings. We are sons [and daughters] of God and the seed of Abraham. (“ Becoming a Missionary ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2005, 47) What stands out to you from what Elder Bednar taught about our foremost identities? If students studied Lesson 23: “ Genesis 12; 17 ,” invite them to summarize with a classmate what they remember about the Abrahamic covenant. Help students see that as the seed, or posterity, of Abraham, not only are we promised significant blessings, but we also covenant to fulfill significant responsibilities. Invite them to complete the following self-assessment. Select which of the following statements are true of you: I understand my responsibilities as the seed of Abraham. I am seeking to fulfill my responsibilities as the seed of Abraham. I have found great joy in fulfilling my responsibilities as the seed of Abraham. I do not understand what my responsibilities are as the seed of Abraham. I have questions about what my responsibilities are as the seed of Abraham. Invite students to record any questions they may have or impressions they felt as they considered these statements. Invite them to seek revelation from their Father in Heaven through the Holy Ghost to know how they can better fulfill their responsibilities as the seed of Abraham. Abraham 2:9–11 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Abraham 2:8–11 , looking for our responsibilities as the seed of Abraham. What does the Savior expect of us? You might invite students to ask any questions about the verses. As you discuss the responsibilities of the Abrahamic covenant, help students identify a truth similar to: As the seed of Abraham, the Savior has given us a responsibility to bless all the families of the earth with the blessings of His gospel. Students may benefit from knowing they can fulfill their covenant responsibility by helping gather Israel. What are some ways we can bless all the families of the earth with the Savior’s gospel? Read 1 Nephi 15:18 , looking for when the Abrahamic covenant will be fulfilled. President Russell M. Nelson testified: Ours is the responsibility to help fulfill the Abrahamic covenant. Ours is the seed foreordained and prepared to bless all people of the world. That is why priesthood duty includes missionary work. After some 4,000 years of anticipation and preparation, this is the appointed day when the gospel is to be taken to the kindreds of the earth. This is the time of the promised gathering of Israel. And we get to participate! Isn’t that exciting? (“ Covenants ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2011, 88) Anytime we do anything that helps anyone—on either side of the veil—to make and keep their covenants with God, we are helping to gather Israel. (“ Let God Prevail ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 92–93) How do you feel about the gospel of Jesus Christ? Why do you think all people need it? What experiences have you (or people you know) had gathering Israel? Fulfilling our responsibilities This portion of the lesson gives students time in class to do something to fulfill their responsibilities in the Abrahamic covenant. You could create learning stations based on the following handout. Students could choose one activity to focus on, or they could rotate through different activities. You might assign student leaders for each station to help their peers complete the exercises. Invite students to seek inspiration when selecting what to focus on. Open PDF After enough time, allow students to share the activity they chose and what they felt inspired to do. As students respond to some or all of the following questions, think of ways to help students seek, recognize, and act on personal revelation. One way for you to do this is to ask yourself, “What else can I invite them to do?” Asking yourself this kind of question can invite inspiration from the Holy Ghost on how to help students act on the personal revelation they receive. For additional training on follow-up questions that invite personal revelation, see “ Help learners seek, recognize, and act on personal revelation ” in Teacher Development Skills. Students may benefit from time to reflect on and answer the following questions in their study journals. What did you do or what plans did you make to bless others with the Savior’s gospel? What have you felt prompted to do in the days and weeks ahead to: Help others make or keep covenants? Share the Savior’s gospel? Help people on the other side of the veil? Consider testifying of our important responsibility, as the seed of Abraham, to share the blessings of the Savior’s gospel with all people. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Abraham 2:9–11 is “The Lord promised Abraham that his seed would ‘bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations.’” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 25 ---\nThe Lord has made glorious promises to the faithful, but sometimes the circumstances of our lives can lead us to wonder how these promises can possibly be fulfilled. Abraham and Sarah may have felt that way after the Lord promised in their old age that Sarah would have a child. This lesson can help students increase their trust that the Lord will keep His promises. Student preparation: Invite students to memorize and reflect on the first line found in Genesis 18:14 : “Is any thing too hard for the Lord?” You could encourage them to think of times they have seen the Lord accomplish seemingly impossible things in the scriptures, their own lives, or the lives of others. Possible Learning Activities The Lord’s promises to us Display the following scenarios to illustrate why a person might question whether God will keep His promises. For another scenario, you could watch “ Continue in Patience ” (2:41), from time code 1:07 to 1:55. This video is available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . You could also invite students to create their own, similar scenarios. 2:42 A young woman has chosen to be honest in her schoolwork, believing the Lord will bless her. She notices her grades are worse than other students who are cheating. A young man received his patriarchal blessing, which states that he will serve a full-time mission. During a medical exam, doctors discover he has physical complications that will not allow him to serve. A young woman has put Moroni’s promise to the test by reading the Book of Mormon and praying to know that it is true. She feels she has not received an answer. What are some questions these young people might have about God and His promises? Invite students to think of situations in which they or people they know could have a difficult time seeing how the Lord will fulfill promised blessings. Consider inviting students to write about these situations in their study journals. They might also write any questions they have. Encourage students to put forth effort that can invite the Holy Ghost into their learning. Testify that as they do so, the Holy Ghost can help them find answers to their questions and increase their trust that the Lord will fulfill His promises. The Lord’s promises to Abraham and Sarah As students study the account of Sarah and Abraham, you could help them practice reading the scriptures within the appropriate context. The following paragraph can introduce students to this skill: As we study the scriptures, it can be helpful to understand the context (circumstances or background surrounding a particular passage). The context can clarify and bring a deeper understanding to the stories or teachings in the scriptures. For example, while studying the story of Abraham and Sarah, it can be helpful to know that for much of his life, Abraham desired to be a father (see Abraham 1:2 ). But as he and his wife Sarah aged past normal childbearing years, it appeared that they would not experience the promised blessings of having children of their own during their mortal lives. The handout titled “The Lord’s Promises to Abraham and Sarah” can help students practice using context to better understand what they are reading in the scriptures. You could model this by studying Genesis 15:1–6 as a class. You could then place students in small groups to study the other verses. Before students study, you might explain that as part of His covenant with Abram and Sarai, the Lord changed their names to Abraham and Sarah (see Genesis 17:5, 15 ). You could also explain that the word laugh in Genesis 17:17 ; 18:12 ; and 21:6 comes from the Hebrew root tzachak , which can also mean “to rejoice” (see also Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 17:23 ). Open PDF After students have studied and discussed with their groups, consider inviting a few volunteers to share their insights with the class. You could then ask the following questions: How do you feel the context helped you understand what you studied? How might you have felt if you had experienced what Abraham and Sarah did in these verses? The Lord keeps His promises Read Genesis 21:1–6 , looking for how the Lord kept His promises to Abraham and Sarah. What truths do you learn about the Lord from this account? When students state converting principles in their own words, it can deepen their understanding of the scriptures and the words of the prophets. Sometimes students may struggle to identify truths from a scripture passage. Providing a prophetic statement like the following can help clarify what they are learning and help them be successful in stating truths. (For additional training on helping students state converting principles, see “ Focus on truths that lead to conversion and build faith in Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills.) President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, shared a lesson he learned about God’s promises: God’s promises are not always fulfilled as quickly as or in the way we might hope; they come according to His timing and in His ways. (“ Continue in Patience ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2010, 58) One truth students could identify is that the Lord fulfills His promises in His time and in His way . How can we benefit from times when the Lord’s promises are not immediately fulfilled in our lives? What do you know about the Lord that could help you while you wait for His promises to be fulfilled? Students might benefit by looking for scriptures about the Lord that could help them answer the previous question. Possible passages could include John 14:18 ; 1 Nephi 9:6 ; Mosiah 24:14 ; Doctrine and Covenants 24:8 ; 68:6 . Experiences and testimonies To help students reflect on what they have learned, consider displaying the following statement or watching “ Good Things to Come ” (4:55), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Invite students to think of personal experiences that could relate to the statement or video. 4:55 President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared the following insight about the Lord’s promised blessings: Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don’t come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come . (“ An High Priest of Good Things to Come ,” Ensign , Nov. 1999, 38) What experiences have you or others had that have helped you believe that the Lord will keep His promises in His way and in His time? Prepare students to testify of the truths they have learned or felt. You could do this by displaying the following instructions: Choose one of the following activities to complete in your study journal: Reflect on the scenarios that were shared at the beginning of the lesson. Write a letter to one of those individuals, and include why you believe the Lord will keep His promises. Write a short paragraph in your journal. Include things you have learned and felt today that could help you when you are waiting for the Lord’s promises to be fulfilled. Invite a few volunteers to share their feelings with the class. You could conclude by sharing your witness that the Lord will keep His promises.\n\n\n--- Lesson 26 ---\nThe Lord has always been concerned about evil influences in our lives. Members of Lot’s family were influenced by the evils that surrounded them in the city of Sodom. This lesson can help students avoid evil influences in their lives so they can more fully follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to think about influences in their lives or temptations they face that prevent them from following Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Invite them to think about why they need to remove these obstacles from their lives and how they might do so. Possible Learning Activities Small choices with big consequences Elder Massimo De Feo of the Seventy shared an important truth about the effect our choices can have: The decisions we make every day may seem small, but they always have real implications and big consequences, for good or bad. (“ Small Choices, Big Consequences ,” Ensign , Aug. 2019, 34) What are some examples of small choices we make that can have big consequences? If needed, consider sharing a few examples, such as the media we use; the type of friends we choose; or the choices we make about studying the scriptures, attending church, or praying. Other examples may be more relevant to your students. Invite the students to discuss how these choices could have big consequences, for good or bad. Then share the following to help students prepare themselves spiritually for today’s lesson. Think about choices you are currently making that are leading you toward Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Also think about choices that may be leading you away from Them. As you study today, pay attention to spiritual impressions about how you can come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Lot pitches his tent toward Sodom The Old Testament contains an account of a man named Lot, the nephew of Abraham. Lot and his family lived in the city of Sodom, which was known for its extreme wickedness (see Genesis 13:13 ; 18:20 ; Ezekiel 16:49–50 ; Jude 1:7–8 ). It was a seemingly small choice that led Lot and his family to dwell in Sodom. Invite students to share what they know about the circumstances that led Lot to dwell in Sodom. The following explanation could be used as needed. After Abraham, Lot, and their families moved from Egypt to the land of Canaan, there was a disagreement between Abraham’s herdsmen and Lot’s herdsmen over their grazing land. To help avoid further conflict, Abraham and Lot separated their families, and each decided where they would live (see Genesis 13:8–9 ). Rather than reading the following verses as a class, students could work with a partner. Partnerships could read the verses and draw a picture depicting the actions of Lot and Abraham. Read Genesis 13:10–13, 18 , looking for where each family decided to live. (In these verses, Abram refers to Abraham. The Lord later changed his name to Abraham, as recorded in Genesis 17:5 .) What differences did you notice between each family’s decision? What decisions could someone make today that might be similar to Lot pitching his tent toward Sodom? What counsel might you give in these situations? If students struggle to think of modern-day decisions that are similar to Lot pitching his tent toward Sodom, you could share a few examples, then allow students to give advice for these situations. Examples could include using unclean language, choosing media with inappropriate content, lowering standards of dress or modesty to fit in, or spending time with friends who disregard the Savior’s teachings. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah Lot and his family did not remain with their tent pitched toward Sodom. Eventually, they moved to and “dwelt in Sodom” ( Genesis 14:12 ; emphasis added). Students could cross-reference Genesis 14:12 with Genesis 13:12 in their scriptures. If students created a drawing earlier in the lesson, you could also invite them to update their drawing to reflect Lot’s new location. The inhabitants of Sodom and the nearby city of Gomorrah rejected the prophets the Lord sent to warn them (see Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 203). In His mercy, the Lord sent messengers to Sodom to warn Lot and his family to leave before the city was destroyed (see Genesis 19:12–13 ). Because the people rejected the prophets and persisted in wickedness they were destroyed. Read Genesis 19:14–19, 24–26 , looking for how Lot and his family responded to the instructions to leave the city quickly. What stands out to you in these verses? Why? What do these verses teach you about the Lord? You may also want to ask students what they are learning that could help someone who feels like it is not a big deal to participate in seemingly small acts of wickedness. To help students understand why Lot’s wife was turned into a “pillar of salt” (verse 26), it could be helpful to explain that Lot’s wife might not have merely looked back but might have returned to Sodom (see Luke 17:28–32 ). You could also share the following statement by President Jeffrey R. Holland. President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared possible reasons why Lot’s wife was turned into a “pillar of salt” (verse 26): Apparently what was wrong with Lot’s wife was that she wasn’t just looking back; in her heart she wanted to go back. … It is possible that Lot’s wife looked back with resentment toward the Lord for what He was asking her to leave behind. (“ Remember Lot’s Wife ” [Brigham Young University devotional, Jan. 13, 2009], 2, speeches.byu.edu ) Consider inviting students to discuss the following question with a partner or a small group before sharing their responses with the class. What are some truths you learn from the account of Lot and his family that could apply to situations you face in your life? Using their own words, students could identify truths like the following: Allowing evil influences into our lives—even seemingly small ones—can lead us away from Jesus Christ. As disciples of Jesus Christ, we should flee wickedness and not look back. To help students better understand and feel the importance of these truths, consider discussing questions like the following. What can help you recognize seemingly small influences that would lead you away from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? How can the Savior help us leave our past mistakes behind and move forward with faith? Invite the students to share experiences they have that relate to the truths you are discussing. You could also share your own experiences. Apply it to your life To help the students apply the truths they have studied, display the following instructions and questions. Invite students to seek inspiration from God to recognize changes He would have them make. Think about what actions you have felt prompted to take as a result of what you have studied today. In your study journal, write a plan for what you will do and when you will do it. If needed, the following questions could help you create a plan: What are some seemingly small decisions you are currently making that could eventually lead you away from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? What changes will you make? What will you do to leave past mistakes behind and move forward with faith in Jesus Christ? Consider testifying of the truths you have studied today. Encourage students to act on their plans.\n\n\n--- Lesson 27 ---\nOur mortal minds may never fully comprehend the heart-wrenching commandment God gave to Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac. The Nephite prophet Jacob increased our understanding of the powerful symbolism of this commandment when he taught that the sacrifice was “a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son” ( Jacob 4:5 ). This lesson can help students feel the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. Student preparation: Invite students to identify a scripture they have found that helps them recognize the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for us. Have them come prepared to share it. Possible Learning Activities The love of God Consider beginning the lesson by sharing the following statement. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then a member of the First Presidency, described the love Heavenly Father has for His children: 19:44 Think of the purest, most all-consuming love you can imagine. Now multiply that love by an infinite amount—that is the measure of God’s love for you. God does not look on the outward appearance. I believe that He doesn’t care one bit if we live in a castle or a cottage, if we are handsome or homely, if we are famous or forgotten. Though we are incomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, God’s love encompasses us completely. (“ The Love of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2009, 22) In addition to the words used by President Uchtdorf, what are some other words or phrases you could use to describe God’s love for us? To help the students personalize the lesson to their lives, invite them to consider how often they feel or recognize the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. You might also invite them to consider what questions they currently have about the love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Encourage the students as they study today to pay attention to impressions from the Holy Ghost that can help them feel the love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. A manifestation of God’s love The scriptures contain many teachings that describe the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for us. One example is in John 3:16 . Read John 3:16 , looking for the greatest manifestation of Heavenly Father’s love. How would you summarize what you found? Students may share something like Heavenly Father demonstrated His love for us through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ . How does the Savior’s atoning sacrifice demonstrate the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for us? Abraham is commanded to sacrifice his son Explain that today, students will study an account that can teach us about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ demonstrated through the Savior’s Atonement. Consider displaying the following picture. What do you know about this experience from the lives of Abraham and Isaac? After students share their responses, explain the following. The account of Abraham and Isaac can teach us about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ demonstrated toward us through the Savior’s atoning sacrifice. Read Jacob 4:5 , looking for what Jacob taught about this account. What did you find? As students study the account of Abraham and Isaac in Genesis 22 , invite them to pay attention to what this account can symbolically teach them about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. To prepare students to do this, consider making two columns on the board. Title one column Abraham and Isaac and the other column Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ . You could also invite the students to create this chart in their study journals. Students could complete the following study activity on their own or with a partner. Consider sharing one example from the completed chart (found later in the lesson) before students begin their study. Prayerfully read Genesis 22:1–14 , looking for similarities to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Highlight meaningful scripture phrases. Record your thoughts about what these phrases teach you about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The following chart contains examples of insights students may find while they study this account. As needed, you could use these examples to help students in their study. For example, you might share the insight about the land of Moriah (see Genesis 22:2 ) before or after students study. Abraham and Isaac Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ Genesis 22:2, 12 —“thine only son” Jesus Christ is Heavenly Father’s Only Begotten Son (see John 3:16 ). Genesis 22:2 —“the land of Moriah” “The site known traditionally as the place where Abraham offered Isaac is … in the same area in which the Father would make the sacrifice of His Son” ( Old Testament Student Manual , 3rd ed. [2003], 77). Genesis 22:2 —“a burnt offering” Burnt offerings were a form of animal sacrifice. Animal sacrifice was symbolic of Jesus Christ (see Moses 5:4–7 ). Genesis 22:6 —“took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son” Christ carried His cross (see John 19:16–18 ). Genesis 22:7–8 —“God will provide himself a lamb” Heavenly Father sent His Son, the Lamb of God, as an atoning sacrifice (see John 1:29 ). Genesis 22:9 —“bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar” Christ was bound to the cross with nails (see 1 Nephi 11:33 ). After students have had time to study, give them an opportunity to share what the Spirit taught them as they studied these verses. You might ask questions like the following as part of this discussion. What did you learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from the story of Abraham and Isaac? What were some of the symbols of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that were most meaningful to you? Why? God’s love for me Give students an opportunity to reflect on the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. To prepare them to reflect, you could sing or listen to a hymn that focuses on that love, such as “ God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son ” ( Hymns , no. 187). You could also consider sharing the statement by President Dallin H. Oaks in Additional Resources. How can remembering the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for you affect your life? What has helped or could help you to feel the love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Conclude the lesson by inviting students to think about what they have learned and felt today about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. Invite them to record their thoughts and spiritual impressions in their study journals. Consider sharing your testimony about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for each of us. Encourage the students to seek out experiences that will help them consistently feel God’s love for them.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 29 ---\nWhile the prospect of an eternal marriage may have seemed out of reach to Isaac, the Lord prepared a way for him. We can likewise rely on the Lord and trust that He can help us prepare for and someday obtain the blessings of eternal marriage. This lesson can help students understand the importance of eternal, covenant marriage in Heavenly Father’s plan. Student preparation: Invite students to write a question they or someone they know might have about temple marriage and come to class prayerfully seeking answers to that question. Possible Learning Activities Temple marriage As marriage can be difficult for some students to discuss, prayerfully ponder ways to prepare and teach this topic with sensitivity and love. To prepare students to discuss the topic of marriage, consider displaying the picture at the beginning of the lesson, along with the following scenario. Imagine a friend says: “Is it really that important to be married in the temple? I have a hard time seeing myself getting married there anyway; it feels out of reach for me. I just want to find someone I love.” What are some assumptions your friend might have about temple marriage? What truths might your friend not understand about God and temple marriage? Invite students to answer the following questions in their study journals. How do you personally feel about temple marriage? What questions or concerns do you have about temple marriage? As you study Genesis 24 , invite the Spirit to help you understand the importance of temple marriage. Seek insight on how the Lord can help you receive an eternal, temple marriage. An important journey To help students better understand the context of Genesis 24 , invite them to view the following map. If they have access to the Latter-day Saint edition of the King James Bible, they can find it as map 9, “The World of the Old Testament,” in the Bible Maps section. Read or summarize the following paragraph, and invite students to find the places you mention on the map. If needed, show students where Canaan (number 13) and Haran (number 8) are located. Abraham and his family lived in Canaan among people who worshipped idols and engaged in other sinful practices. Abraham had relatives that lived in Haran, where Abraham previously lived. Before reading the following verses, explain that the Joseph Smith Translation changes the word “thigh” to “hand” in verses 2 and 9 . This means that Abraham and his servant entered into an agreement. Read Genesis 24:1–4, 7–9 , looking for instructions Abraham gave his servant regarding his son Isaac. What was Abraham’s servant instructed to do? What do you see in verse 7 that shows the Lord cared about whom Isaac married? Have students use the scale on the map to determine how many miles or kilometers this journey would be. Help students see that Abraham asked his servant to travel nearly 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) round trip to find a wife for Isaac. Why do you think it was worth such sacrifice that Isaac not marry one of the Canaanite daughters? As needed, explain that when God established His covenant with Abraham and Sarah, He said that Abraham’s posterity would only keep this important covenant with Him if they married according to His law. They would need to enter into “the new and everlasting covenant of marriage” (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4 ). Today, we enter into this covenant when we are married in the Lord’s holy temples. There was no one in the land of Canaan whom Isaac could marry in the covenant. The covenant could only be preserved with someone from Abraham’s family in Haran. The Lord’s help Display the following image, and invite students to share what they know about the account pictured. You could read or summarize the following paragraph if needed. Abraham’s servant traveled the long distance to Haran to find a wife for Isaac. While waiting by a well, he prayed and asked God for the ability to know whom the Lord would have him find. You could invite students to read the following verses individually, in pairs, or as a class. For the below activity, it may be helpful to explain that the name “Jehovah” in the King James Version of the Bible is generally indicated by LORD in all capital letters. The words “Lord” or “lord”, on the other hand, may simply refer to someone holding power, authority, or influence, such as a master or ruler. (See Bible Dictionary, “ Jehovah ”) Read Genesis 24:12–27 , looking for how the Lord helped Abraham’s servant find a wife for Isaac. It may be helpful to mark when you see the word LORD when every letter is capitalized. What did you find? Consider summarizing the rest of Genesis 24 by sharing the following paragraph. Abraham’s servant met Rebekah’s brother and father. He explained who he was and how the Lord had helped him find Rebekah. The following day, Rebekah courageously chose to return with the servant and be sealed to Isaac in the covenant of eternal marriage (see Genesis 24:29–67 ). What do you learn about the Lord through the account of Isaac and Rebekah and their eternal marriage? Students may respond with a variety of truths, but be sure they understand that the Lord will help us as we strive to enter into the covenant of eternal marriage . How can the Lord help someone who is striving for an eternal marriage but worries they may never receive this blessing? Why do you think eternal marriage is so important to the Lord? Why eternal marriage? To help students better understand the importance of eternal marriage, invite them to draw in their study journals a simple image of a temple, such as the one below. Underneath your temple drawing, write a question that could help you better understand the truths you’ve learned today. This could be your own question, a question from someone you know, or one of the following: Why is eternal marriage important? What blessings can I obtain by being married in the temple and then striving to honor those covenants? How can the Lord help me someday obtain the blessings of eternal marriage? Invite students to take 5–8 minutes to complete the following activity individually or with partners. You could invite them to list in their study journals answers that they find. Help students understand that they might not find clear answers to their questions; however, the effort to ask questions and seek understanding is an important part of acting with faith in God. Distribute the handout titled “Eternal Marriage” to students who would like to study it. To help you respond to your question, search various Church resources, such as the following: Doctrinal mastery passages ( Genesis 2:24 ; 1 Corinthians 11:11 ; Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4 ) The handout titled “Eternal Marriage” “Marriage” and related entries in the Topical Guide, Guide to the Scriptures, or Topics and Questions in the Gospel Library Phrases such as “covenant marriage” or “temple marriage” in the Gospel Library search Open PDF Invite students to share with the class what they learned. Personal reflection Reflect on the scenario from the beginning of class. In your study journal, answer the following questions: How would you respond to your friend’s question about why temple marriage is important? What did you learn today about Heavenly Father or Jesus Christ that could give you hope in your efforts to invite the blessings of temple marriage? Invite willing students to share what they wrote. Consider sharing your testimony of the importance of covenant marriage, and encourage your students to begin now to prepare for it.\n\n\n--- Lesson 30 ---\nWith the birth of their twins Jacob and Esau, the covenant promise of posterity for Rebekah and Isaac was at last realized. Esau, as the elder twin, would have been entitled to the birthright promises given to the firstborn son. Tragically, Esau did not prioritize his eternal blessings, instead seeking to satisfy his worldly desires. This lesson can help students value the Lord’s eternal blessings over worldly desires. Student preparation: Encourage students to prayerfully evaluate the balance in their lives between the things of God (e.g., prayer, scripture study, church activity) and the things of the world. Invite them to identify any worldly distractions that may be taking priority over eternal things. Possible Learning Activities Valuing the things of God To help students think about how immediate needs or wants can sometimes affect long-term goals, draw the following chart on the board: Now Future Now Future Invite a few students to share a goal they have for their future. List these on the board in the second column. Select one of the goals in the second column. Invite students to think about immediate needs or wants that, if acted upon, could prevent someone from achieving that goal. Give students an opportunity to share a few different ideas. Discuss how choices we make now can affect our future goals and maybe even prevent us from achieving them. When students have finished, explain that this concept can also apply to our efforts to seek God’s eternal blessings. Invite students to complete the following self-assessment in their study journals. Prayerfully reflect on the following statements. Record in your journal how much each statement applies to you, using the answers “definitely,” “mostly,” “a little,” and “not at all.” I am willing to sacrifice earthly desires for eternal blessings. I understand why the Lord asks me to value His eternal blessings over things I want now. I recognize the blessings that come when I prioritize Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ over the things of the world. As you study today, invite the Holy Ghost to help you see the value of eternal blessings. Seek inspiration about how to prioritize eternal blessings over earthly desires. Birthright inheritance and blessing To help students understand the cultural significance of the decisions Esau and Jacob made, summarize the following paragraphs in your own words. In Old Testament times, the oldest son typically received the birthright. The birthright inheritance included a double portion of land and wealth. It also included greater responsibility to care for the mother and the rest of the family following the death of the father. In addition to the temporal inheritance, the father would give a birthright blessing to confer priesthood authority upon the oldest son. This blessing established the son’s position in the family as teacher and leader. Rebekah and Isaac prayed for the blessing of a righteous posterity for many years. Eventually, they were blessed with twin boys, Esau and Jacob. Because Esau was born first, he would have been the birthright son. However, the Lord had revealed to Rebekah that Jacob was to be the birthright son ( Genesis 25:22–23 ). Read Genesis 25:27–34 , looking for how Esau demonstrated that he did not value his birthright blessing. (To “sod pottage” means to cook soup or stew.) What did you find? Read Genesis 26:34–35 , looking for Esau’s decision and his parents feelings about his marriage choices. (Hittites were Canaanites who worshipped false gods.) Why were Rebekah and Isaac grieved by Esau’s decision? If students are not sure how to respond to the previous question, you might explain that the Canaanites worshipped idols and engaged in other sinful practices. Marrying Canaanite women meant that Esau turned away from the covenant God made with Abraham and his posterity. The blessings of valuing the things of God To help students understand the story of Jacob and Esau, the following paragraph could be read or summarized. Or you could share the video “ Jacob and Esau ” (2:06), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 2:5 Despite Esau’s bad choices, Isaac in his old age summoned Esau to give him the birthright blessing. Before Esau arrived, Rebekah disguised Jacob as his brother. Thinking Jacob was Esau, Isaac blessed Jacob with the birthright blessing (see Genesis 27:1–29 ). “After Isaac acknowledged that he had blessed Jacob instead of Esau, he affirmed that Jacob ‘shall be blessed’ ( Genesis 27:33 )—suggesting that God’s will had been accomplished” ( Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: Old Testament 2022 , 39). Read Genesis 27:34, 38 , looking for Esau’s reaction when he learned that Isaac had given the birthright blessing to Jacob. What stands out to you? How would you summarize what we learn from this story as a statement of truth? Use students’ words to identify a truth similar to the following: Choosing immediate or worldly desires over God’s eternal blessings can lead to sorrow and regret. There are a lot of possible answers to the following question. Encouraging several students to share their answers can help students feel safe to share different ideas and perspectives. Why can it sometimes be challenging to prioritize things that have eternal value? Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained: In the busyness of our daily lives and in the commotion of the contemporary world in which we live, we may be distracted from the eternal things that matter the most by making pleasure, prosperity, popularity, and prominence our primary priorities. Our short-term preoccupation with “the things of this world” and “the honors of men” may lead us to forfeit our spiritual birthright for far less than a mess of pottage. … Each of us should evaluate our temporal and spiritual priorities sincerely and prayerfully to identify the things in our lives that may impede the bounteous blessings that Heavenly Father and the Savior are willing to bestow upon us. (“ Put On Thy Strength, O Zion ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 94) Have students share what they liked or learned from Elder Bednar’s statement. Then invite them to do the following three things individually or in small groups: Create a scenario where someone your age may be tempted to “forfeit our spiritual birthright for far less than a mess of pottage.” Think of an example of how the Savior prioritized His Father’s will over immediate or worldly desires. (For example, see Matthew 4:2–10 or Luke 22:41–42 .) Think of a modern-day example of someone prioritizing God’s will over immediate or worldly desires. Ask students to share their ideas. As students share, you could point out that attending seminary today is a good example of putting God first. You could show the video “ No Regrets ” (5:38) from ChurchofJesusChrist.org . A young man chose to attend seminary over surfing. Encourage students to look for the blessings he received because of this choice. 5:39 What blessings can we receive, now and in the future, for choosing the things of God over the things of the world? How did the Savior place eternal blessings above immediate desires? Make a plan Invite students to complete the following activity in their study journals. List your top five priorities in order of most to least important. As you review this list, note any adjustments the Holy Ghost impresses you to make. Below this list, record any other thoughts you have after doing this activity. Can you identify a clear next step for you to prioritize the things of God more than the things of the world? If so, write this somewhere you will see it regularly. To conclude class, you could share your witness of blessings you have received as you have valued the things of God over the things of the world.\n\n\n--- Lesson 31 ---\nAfter his life was threatened by his brother Esau, Jacob was directed by his parents to travel to his mother’s homeland to find a wife. While journeying, he had a vision that led him to enter into the Abrahamic covenant with God. This lesson can help students feel an increased desire to make covenants with God in the temple. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to review the promises of the Abrahamic covenant ( Abraham 2:8–11 ). Students could be encouraged to try and explain to a member of their family about the Abrahamic covenant and why it is important to them. Possible Learning Activities Why covenants? You could begin class by displaying a picture of a temple and singing the Primary song “ I Love to See the Temple ” ( Children’s Songbook , 95). Then display the following prompt. Invite students to select the statement that is most true of them. Alternatively, you could share only the first part of the prompt, and students could finish the statement in a sentence or two that accurately reflects their feelings and thoughts. When I think about going to the temple in the future to make covenants with God, I: Don’t know what to think. I don’t think about it very much. Get excited. I really look forward to that day. Am a little nervous. I don’t know what to expect. Don’t see much of a point to it. Give students time to write their responses. Invite them to seek inspiration from the Holy Ghost during the lesson. The Holy Ghost can help them appreciate the importance of making covenants with God. Jacob’s dream Invite students to write the following incomplete truth in their study journals. You could also write it on the board and add to it throughout the lesson. In this lesson, you will study about Jacob in Genesis 28 . In Genesis 28:3–4, 12–20 , God established a covenant with Jacob, which Jacob accepted. From this account, we can learn important lessons about the value of making covenants with God. As you study this lesson, look for ways to complete this truth: As we make and keep covenants with God, He will … Ask students to share what they remember about the covenant the Lord made with Abraham. For specific details on this covenant, see Lesson 23 : “ Genesis 12, 17 .” After students share, summarize the following paragraph in your own words. Although Jacob was Abraham’s grandson, he may have felt like the blessings of Abraham’s covenant were out of reach for him. Jacob had not yet married in the covenant. Also, conflict over the birthright and blessing had led Esau to want to take Jacob’s life ( Genesis 27:41 ). To protect Jacob and ensure he had the opportunity to marry in the covenant, Jacob’s parents instructed him to leave home and journey several hundred miles to his mother’s homeland (see Genesis 27:42–46 ; 28:1–2 ). This journey would take Jacob far away from Canaan, the land the birthright promised him. Read Genesis 28:10–15 , looking for what Jacob experienced one night during his journey. Consider inviting students to draw a picture of what Jacob saw in his dream. Students could share their drawings with a partner and explain what stood out to them from the verses. You might then display the following image as one depiction of the vision. What promises from the Abrahamic covenant did the Lord offer Jacob in these verses? What additional promises did the Lord give Jacob in verse 15 ? You could invite students to add these additional promises to their truth. You might list possible responses on the board. Responses might include be with us, protect and care for us , not leave us . Why do you think these promises might have been particularly meaningful to Jacob at this time? To help students better understand these promises, invite them to complete the following activity in pairs or small groups. You might want to encourage students to look for additional scriptures or statements that confirm these promises. Study the following scriptures and statement, looking for how they deepen your understanding of the promises the Lord made to Jacob. John 14:18 Acts 17:27 (note the Joseph Smith Translation) Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said: As you walk the covenant path, from baptism to the temple and throughout life, I promise you power to go against the natural worldly flow—power to learn, power to repent and be sanctified, and power to find hope, comfort, and even joy as you face life’s challenges. I promise you and your family protection against the influence of the adversary, especially when you make the temple a major focus in your life. (“ Accessing God’s Power through Covenants ,” Liahona , May 2023, 37) It might be helpful for students to understand that making covenants does not spare us from challenges in life. However, Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught that these covenants do provide “our greatest hope for avoiding avoidable misery on the one hand and successfully dealing with the unavoidable woes of life on the other” (“ Why the Covenant Path ,” Liahona , May 2021, 117). Which of these promises are most meaningful to you? Jacob’s feelings about his experience It might be helpful to display the following passage and questions. Invite students to read and discuss in pairs or small groups. (Consider sharing with students that the words “afraid” and “dreadful” show that Jacob was in awe. “Dreadful” is better translated as “awe-inspiring.”) Read Genesis 28:16–21 , looking for Jacob’s reaction to his experience. What feelings about the Lord do you see Jacob expressing? How might these feelings motivate him to make a covenant with the Lord? After students have had time to discuss, you could invite a few to share with the class what they learned. Providing opportunities for students to share with each other what they are learning can increase their confidence in participating in gospel conversations. For additional training on how to encourage students to share with others, see “ Encourage learners to share the truths they are learning ” in Teacher Development Skills. (Teaching in the Savior’s Way [2022], 35) What words or phrases from verses 16–21 could relate to modern-day temples? Students might point out words or phrases like “surely the Lord is in this place” ( verse 16 ); “the house of God” and “the gate of heaven” ( verse 17 ); “Beth-el” ( verse 19 ), which means “house of God” (see footnote 19a); and “vowed a vow” ( verse 20 ). You might want to invite students to mark these phrases in their scriptures. Students could add to their drawings of the vision by writing “house of God,” “gate of heaven,” or “temple” somewhere near the bottom of the ladder. Making covenants with the Lord Invite students to do the following activity in their study journals. It might be helpful to tell students that they will reflect on these responses in a future lesson. Students will use what they write here to complete an assessment activity in Lesson 37: “ Assess Your Learning 2 .” To prepare students to write their responses, you might want to share the following paragraph in your own words. As Jacob left his parents’ home and set out on his own, he made covenants with God. God promised to be with, care for, and protect Jacob. In a few short years, you will face many choices about what to do next in your life. Among these decisions will be the opportunity to make covenants with God in the temple. Think about this time in your future as you respond to the following questions in your study journal: What promised blessings have you experienced from striving to keep your covenants with God or by serving in the temple? What situations might you face in the future where you would benefit from the care and protection God promises to people who make covenants with Him? Consider sharing your testimony of how you have experienced the promises associated with making and keeping covenants with the Lord.\n\n\n--- Lesson 32 ---\nThe prophet Jacob is an example of letting God prevail in his life. He went to great effort to marry in the covenant, gain the Lord’s blessings in his day-to-day work, and do what God asked him to do to heal his family relationships. This lesson can help students increase their willingness to let God prevail in their lives. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to list ways God is an influence in their lives. If students would like to learn more on this subject, they can listen, watch, or read portions of President Russell M. Nelson’s talk, “ Let God Prevail ” (18:51). Videos: “ Let God Prevail ” (18:51) from time code 12:18 to 13:02, “ Jacob and His Family ” (3:00) Possible Learning Activities The influences in our lives Consider inviting students to make a list in their study journal of some of the influences in their lives. They might include friends, teachers, counselors, media personalities, parents, prophets, the Lord, and even their own thoughts and ambitions. Then invite them to thoughtfully rank the influence each item on the list has. Students could put a number 1 by the strongest influence in their life, then a number 2, and so forth. Or students could write words like “high,” “medium,” or “low” to indicate the amount of influence for each item. Before they read the following statement, it may be useful to explain that letting God prevail is allowing Him to be the greatest influence in our lives. Read the following inspired questions by President Russell M. Nelson. Ponder how you would answer them. 18:52 Are you willing to let God prevail in your life? Are you willing to let God be the most important influence in your life? Will you allow His words, His commandments, and His covenants to influence what you do each day? Will you allow His voice to take priority over any other? Are you willing to let whatever He needs you to do take precedence over every other ambition? Are you willing to have your will swallowed up in His? (“ Let God Prevail ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 94). Invite students to write their responses to these questions in their study journal. These could include ways they are willing to let God prevail or be the greatest influence in their lives. They can also include ways they are not willing and why it is difficult for them. Seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to give you insights and help with any of your concerns or difficulties, and to help you feel an increased desire to let Him prevail more in your life. Jacob’s example On one occasion, Jacob was “greatly afraid and distressed” ( Genesis 32:7 ), worried for his and his family’s safety. He “wrestled” ( Genesis 32:25 ) all night, determined to obtain the Lord’s blessings for the difficult situation he faced. (You will study more of this situation later in the lesson.) In response, the Lord promised to help Jacob, but He also changed Jacob’s name. Read Genesis 32:28 and mark what the Lord changed Jacob’s name to and why. Consider inviting students to note in their scriptures that one of the meanings of the name Israel is “Let God prevail” (footnote 28b, see Bible Dictionary, “ Israel ”) This lesson highlights three areas of Jacob’s, or Israel’s, life in which he let God prevail. As you study, look for examples of the following principle: As we are willing to let God prevail in our lives, He will bless us in all things. Prepare copies of the following handouts and do one of the following: Give these handouts to three students or groups of students ahead of time and invite them to lead the class through the material. Invite students to complete all three activities in small groups. Give students a basic overview of the three handouts and allow students to select one or two to study. One way to provide an overview is to watch “ Jacob and His Family ” (3:00). 3:0 Open PDF Open PDF Open PDF If students studied these three sections in groups, invite them to share what they learned and how it may be meaningful to them. If they do not naturally mention it, ask what they learned about the Lord. Consider asking students to share other examples they have seen of people who let God prevail in their lives. Letting God prevail in your life Take a moment to ponder what you learned or want to remember from this lesson. Seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost as you add your thoughts to your journal entry from the beginning of the lesson. Include reasons why you may want to let God prevail in your life. You may also include what you feel you could do to increase your desire to let God prevail in your life. If they are not too personal, invite students to share their thoughts. Consider sharing your own thoughts and testimony as well.",

As a result, the Lord blessed and helped him through his trials. This lesson can help students feel hope that God can use their trials to bless their lives. Student preparation: Invite students to think about trials or challenges they have faced or might face. Invite them to come to class prepared to share how the Lord can use or has used challenges to bless their life. Possible Learning Activities A donkey fable Consider displaying a picture of a donkey as a student reads the following paragraph. The fable has been told of a donkey that fell into a pit. Scared and trapped, the donkey whined and brayed. After searching for a way to rescue the donkey, the owner began to shovel dirt into the pit. Each shovel full of dirt landed on the donkey’s back, making it whine more. Before continuing the story, it may be helpful for students to pause and think about the fable by responding to questions like the following: Would you consider the shovels of dirt to be a good thing or a bad thing? Why? What could the shovels full of dirt represent in our lives? Invite a student to read the conclusion of the fable in the following paragraph. The donkey would shake the dirt off its back, causing mounds of dirt to pile underneath. Over and over, the donkey repeated the actions of shaking the dirt off and stepping onto the growing mound, until eventually the donkey rose high enough on the dirt to escape from the pit. How can this fable relate to the trials and challenges Heavenly Father allows us to experience? Consider displaying the following and inviting students to complete it on their own. Think about times in your life when you have had trials or times of discouragement. Record your responses to some of the following questions in your study journal: How have you responded to those experiences? Why can it be hard to remember the Lord when you are facing challenges? From an eternal perspective, how is it possible for Heavenly Father to use your challenges to bless your life? As you study the life of Joseph today, seek revelation from the Holy Ghost to give you hope that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ can turn even difficult trials into blessings in your life. Overview of Genesis 37–41 To help students understand the storyline of Genesis 37–41 , you could display the five images included below in random order. Students could work together as a class or in small groups to place them in chronological order. You could then have a few students use the images to briefly summarize the story in Genesis 37–41 . Students could use the summaries below each image or chapter headings to help them summarize or to verify the order of the images. When Joseph was 17 years old, his older brothers envied his favored status with their father, Jacob. They hated Joseph for sharing dreams he had about them bowing before him in the future. In time, they sold Joseph as a slave (see Genesis 37 ). Joseph was sold to Potiphar, an officer to the Egyptian Pharaoh. Joseph eventually became the overseer of Potiphar’s house (see Genesis 39:1–4 ). Potiphar’s wife lusted after Joseph, but Joseph refused to break the law of chastity and fled from her. Potiphar’s wife falsely accused Joseph of mistreating her, and he was cast into prison (see Genesis 39:7–20 ). While in prison, Joseph interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh’s servants (see Genesis 40 ). Two years later, Pharaoh had dreams that he could not understand. One of Pharaoh’s servants, who had been released from prison, told Pharaoh that Joseph could interpret dreams. Joseph taught Pharaoh that his dreams represented seven years of good harvests and seven years of famine that would soon come to Egypt (see Genesis 41 ). Blessings from our trials To help students identify lessons we can learn from Joseph’s experience, consider placing the students in small groups and providing or displaying the following instructions and questions. Note : Lesson 34, “ Genesis 39 ,” will focus on the law of chastity. Read the following verses looking for how the Lord helped Joseph during his trials. Genesis 39:1–6 (After Joseph was sold as a slave by his brothers) Genesis 39:20–23 (After Joseph was cast into prison by Potiphar) Genesis 41:14–16, 25–32 (After Joseph was finally released from prison) Answer the following questions: What truths can we learn from how Joseph responded to his challenges? Why do you think Joseph had to wait so many years to receive the blessings he sought? What evidence do you see of God helping Joseph in his trials? How can Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ help us in similar ways when we go through hard times? Walk around and listen as students discuss their answers with their groups. Thank them for sharing what they found. Remind students that the Holy Ghost can teach people different truths from the same scripture passages. The remainder of this lesson will focus on the truth that if we are faithful, God can use our trials to bless our lives and others . Read Genesis 41:37–45 , looking for evidence of how God used Joseph’s trials to bless him and others. How did the Lord bless Joseph and others through his trials? Ask questions that can help students learn about God’s power and mercy from the truths being taught. The following questions are examples that you might use. (For additional training on helping students learn about the Lord’s love, power, and mercy, see “ Help learners recognize the Lord’s love, power, and mercy in their lives ” in Teacher Development Skills. What do you think Joseph might want you to know about the Lord after the experiences he went through? How could trials help us strengthen our relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Read Doctrine and Covenants 90:24 and the following statement by Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Look for how they apply to Joseph and all who experience trials and challenges. It is my witness that though at times we may feel buried by the trials of life or surrounded by emotional darkness, the love of God and the blessings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ will bring something unimaginable to spring forth. (“ God Will Do Something Unimaginable ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 52) How do Doctrine and Covenants 90:24 and Elder Uchtdorf’s statement apply to Joseph? To you? Modern-day examples To prepare students to reflect on how Heavenly Father can bless us in our trials, consider showing “ Faith Murray’s Story: Overcoming Adversity through Service ” (4:52), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Invite students to look for how the Lord used Faith’s challenges to bless her and others. 4:52 Think about experiences you, or others, have had when you have seen Heavenly Father use your trials to bless your life. Respond to at least two of the following questions in your study journal: How have you seen Heavenly Father use trials to bless the lives of people you know? What have you learned from those people? If someone were in the middle of a difficult trial right now, what would you want them to know about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? What has helped you remain faithful to God during the trials you have experienced in your life? Students could be invited to share their experiences along with their feelings for the Savior.\n\n\n--- Lesson 34 ---\nAfter Joseph became an overseer in Potiphar’s house, Potiphar’s wife tempted him to break the law of chastity. Joseph knew that succumbing to that temptation was a “sin against God” and chose to flee from the temptation (see Genesis 39:9, 12 ). This lesson can help students show their devotion to God by resisting the temptation to break the law of chastity. Student preparation: Invite students to imagine they were asked to lead a discussion in their Sunday School class about different ways they can resist Satan’s temptations. Invite students to think of three ways they would share with their class. Possible Learning Activities Temptations we face Consider having the class make a list on the board of temptations youth face today. To help students think more about the temptations they personally face and how they respond to them, you could invite each student to complete the following activity on a piece of paper. Choose a temptation and write a brief, realistic scenario where a teenager could face that temptation. Collect the scenarios and redistribute them among the class. Read through your new scenario. On the back of the paper, write what might make it difficult to resist that temptation. Also write two things you might encourage someone to do to help them resist or overcome that temptation. Point out to students that although they may not face the same temptation listed in the scenario, they may be able to apply similar counsel to their own situations. Help students assess their own ability to resist or overcome temptation. Think about the temptations you personally face. What have you done, or could you do, to gain strength from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to resist those temptations? You might invite students to add to what they wrote in the scenario with their own experiences. Encourage them to continue adding ideas to their scenario as they study Genesis 39 . Let them know that as they seek help from the Holy Ghost, He can inspire them with ideas to resist and even overcome the temptations that they face. Joseph’s experience with temptation If you used pictures to summarize the events of Joseph’s life in Lesson 33: “ Genesis 37–41 ,” consider displaying them again. Invite a student to summarize what they remember about how the Lord blessed Joseph in Potiphar’s house. If students need help, invite them to read and summarize Genesis 39:1–6 . Read Genesis 39:7–8 , looking for what happened to Joseph after he became overseer in Potiphar’s house. What temptation did Joseph face? Explain that Joseph faced the temptation to break the law of chastity. Help students reflect on what they understand about the law of chastity by inviting them to do the following. In your study journal, write how you would define the law of chastity and why it is important. When students are done writing, consider displaying the following statement. Invite students to read it on their own, looking for insights that they could add to what they wrote in their study journals. For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices states the following about the law of chastity: The law of chastity states that God approves of sexual activity only between a man and a woman who are married. … Outside of marriage between a man and a woman, it is wrong to touch the private, sacred parts of another person’s body even if clothed. In your choices about what you do, look at, read, listen to, think about, post, or text, avoid anything that purposely arouses lustful emotions in others or yourself. This includes pornography in any form. ( For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices , 23, 25) Why do you think Heavenly Father has given us the law of chastity? What are some ways Satan tempts youth to break the law of chastity? Possible answers students may give include taking or sending inappropriate pictures, viewing or listening to media that is sexually suggestive or explicit, not keeping sex or sexual feelings sacred. If students have questions about same-sex attraction, it may be helpful to explain that “feeling same-sex attraction is not a sin. If [someone has] these feelings and [does] not pursue or act on them, [they] are living Heavenly Father’s sacred law of chastity” ( For Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices , 27). Read Genesis 39:9–12 , looking for how Joseph resisted the temptation to break the law of chastity. Genesis 39:9 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. What did you learn from Joseph’s example? Students may identify truths such as: Our devotion to God can give us strength to resist the temptation to break the law of chastity ( verse 9 ). Students could mark in their scriptures what Joseph’s devotion to God enabled him to do, for example, in verse 8 (“he refused”), verse 10 (“he hearkened not”), and verse 12 (“got him out”). To help students answer the following question, you may want to provide them with a scenario they can use to share how someone could do the three things Joseph did. A possible scenario could involve being invited to a movie, show, or concert where immoral images and words are used. Another possible scenario could involve feeling pressure to send inappropriate texts or pictures to peers. What are some ways we can follow Joseph’s example when we face temptation? Strengthening our ability to keep the law of chastity To help students deepen their understanding of this truth, distribute the accompanying handout to students. Consider placing students in pairs and assigning each partner to focus on one of the questions on the handout. Open PDF Invite students to share what they learned with their partners. The Savior can help us overcome temptation You may have students who are struggling with obeying the law of chastity and need to feel hope in repenting and overcoming addiction. Testify of the loving, patient, and forgiving nature of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Consider showing the video “ Temptation Fades as We Seek Christ in Every Thought ” (2:57), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Invite students to look for how the Savior can give us hope. 2:58 Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught how the Savior can give hope to those who have struggled with keeping God’s commandments. No matter how long we have been off the path or how far away we have wandered, the moment we decide to change, God helps us return. From God’s perspective, through sincere repentance and pressing forward with a steadfastness in Christ, once back on the path, it will be as if we were never off. The Savior pays for our sins and frees us from the looming decrease in happiness and blessings. (“ Choose You This Day ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 106) What would you want someone who feels hopeless because of their previous choices to understand from Elder Renlund’s statement? What has helped you to resist temptation that you might suggest to other people? Making a plan to keep the law of chastity To help students make a plan to act on what the Spirit has taught them about keeping the law of chastity, give them a few minutes to respond to the following questions in their study journals. What did you learn that can help you keep the law of chastity or resist other temptations? What did you learn about being devoted to God? How will you begin to apply what you have learned and felt today? Encourage students to involve Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in their efforts to resist temptation. Consider sharing your testimony of the Savior’s ability to help us overcome temptation and His loving mercy in helping us repent. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase is “How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 35 ---\nMany years after he was sold into Egypt as a slave, Joseph was reunited with his brothers. He could have had felt angry and resentful because of all that he suffered. However, like the Savior, Joseph chose to extend mercy and forgiveness to his brothers who had mistreated him. This lesson can help students follow the Savior’s example by being more forgiving. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder the Savior’s commandment to “forgive all men” ( Doctrine and Covenants 64:10 ). Ask them to list some of the blessings they or others have experienced through forgiving someone. Possible Learning Activities Joseph of Egypt To begin class, consider inviting students to briefly review the account of Joseph of Egypt in Genesis 37–41 . You could ask them to summarize the unkind actions of Joseph’s brothers and the events that led to Joseph’s status as second in command of all of Egypt. The digital images found in Lesson 33: Genesis 37–41 could be used to help students summarize the story. What are some of the ways Joseph suffered because of his brothers’ actions? How would you feel about someone who did this to you? What can make it hard to forgive someone? Reflect on how you typically respond when someone does or says something hurtful to you. As you study today, pay close attention to any impressions you might receive from the Holy Ghost to help you know how you can follow the Savior’s example to forgive. Joseph was reunited with his brothers To study the story of Joseph’s reunion with his brothers, you could organize students in groups of three. Each student in the group could study one of the three summaries and scripture passages. Students could then teach the other members of the group their part of the story. Alternately, you could show the animated video “ Joseph and the Famine ” (2:26) from time code 00:00 to 01:41 on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 2:26 Review the following summaries and study the accompanying verses. Summary 1: Many years after they sold Joseph as a slave, his brothers traveled to Egypt to seek relief from a famine. Presenting themselves before Joseph, now second in command of all Egypt, the brothers did not recognize him. Not knowing that Joseph recognized and could understand them, the brothers expressed their sorrow and regret for what they had done years earlier to him. Read Genesis 42:21–24 , looking for how Joseph reacted to hearing his brothers talk about how they had treated him. Summary 2: Joseph provided food for the family but imprisoned Simeon and instructed the other brothers not to return to Egypt unless they brought the youngest brother, Benjamin, with them. The brothers returned home, but when the family ran out of food again, they returned to Egypt with Benjamin. Read Genesis 43:30 , looking for how Joseph reacted to seeing his brother Benjamin. Summary 3: Joseph tested his brothers’ love for Benjamin by accusing him of stealing and threatening to throw him in jail. Judah offered his life in exchange for Benjamin’s. Read Genesis 45:1–2 , looking for how Joseph reacted after Judah volunteered to give his life to protect Benjamin. After students have had a chance to study the summaries, you could invite them to discuss the following question. What would have been helpful for Joseph to remember about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as he interacted with his brothers? Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ forgive The following scriptures illustrate the forgiving nature of both Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. You could display these scriptures for students to study or have them find their own scripture passages about the forgiving nature of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Read the following scriptures, looking for what would be helpful for someone who has been mistreated to know about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Luke 6:36 Ephesians 4:31–32 Colossians 3:13 What would you share from these verses? Read Genesis 45:3–8 and 9–15 , looking for how Joseph responded to his brothers. What do we learn about becoming like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from Joseph’s example? Students might identify a variety of truths. Thank them for what they share and ask them why they feel it is an important doctrine or principle for us to know. If students do not mention it, share the following truth and write it on the board: We become like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as we forgive others. By relying on the Savior, we can forgive others To help students understand this truth, you could show the video “ Forgiving Others: An Easter Message from President Russell M. Nelson ” (5:01) from ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 5:1 Another option is to study the following statement. President Russell M. Nelson helped us understand how we rely on the Savior’s power when we forgive others. 17:18 If forgiveness presently seems impossible, plead for power through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ to help you. As you do so, I promise personal peace and a burst of spiritual momentum. When the Savior atoned for all mankind, He opened a way that those who follow Him can have access to His healing, strengthening, and redeeming power. These spiritual privileges are available to all who seek to hear Him and follow Him. (“ The Power of Spiritual Momentum ,” Liahona , May 2022, 100) How can President Nelson’s teachings help us forgive others? What would you counsel someone to do if they are struggling to forgive? What would you recommend they do to rely on the Savior? If students need help with the last question, you may suggest they look at the Lord’s counsel in Doctrine and Covenants 64:9–11 , particularly verse 11 . Consider inviting students to share an experience where they or someone they know was able to forgive. It might be helpful to remind students not to share details that might be too personal about them or someone they know. You may also want to share an experience of your own. Help us to freely forgive To help students reflect on what they have learned and felt about becoming like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, you could display some of the following activities for students to complete in their study journals. Prayerfully ponder any impressions you have received as you studied today. Invite the Holy Ghost to help you recognize any changes you need to make. Ask Heavenly Father to help increase your ability to forgive others. Select one of the following activities to complete in your study journal. Write a short paragraph that summarizes how you have been blessed by your efforts to forgive others. List what you have done to include the Savior in your efforts. What do you feel is important to remember the next time you need to forgive someone? Prayerfully consider if there is someone in your life you need to forgive. Write a short paragraph identifying the feelings you have about forgiving that person. What do you recognize that may be preventing your ability to forgive? List some ways you can seek the Savior’s help in your efforts. Write a note that could help a friend who is struggling to forgive someone. Briefly explain how Joseph’s choice to forgive his brothers was like the Savior. Include a scripture passage that has been meaningful to you in your efforts to forgive others. You could invite a few willing students to share what they wrote. Consider concluding the lesson by inviting students to act on any spiritual impressions they may have received. You might share your witness of the blessings available when we follow the Savior’s example to forgive others.\n\n\n--- Lesson 36 ---\nShortly before his death, Joseph of Egypt prophesied that in the latter days the Lord would raise up Joseph Smith to do His work. We can receive our own witness that Joseph Smith was the Lord’s servant. This lesson can help students strengthen their testimonies that the Lord called Joseph Smith to be a prophet. Student preparation: Invite students to write down what the Prophet Joseph Smith has done that has helped them come closer to Jesus Christ. They might ask a family member or friend to share their thoughts and feelings as well. Possible Learning Activities Delivering the Lord’s people Consider displaying the images of Joseph in Egypt and of Moses. Ask students to identify how the Lord used each of these individuals as a deliverer (a person who rescues others). Next, show the image of Joseph Smith and ask students how the Lord used him as a deliverer. Finally, show an image of Jesus Christ, the Deliverer, and discuss ways that Jesus Christ delivers us. After students share their thoughts, use the images and the paragraph below to summarize the events and prophecies in the Joseph Smith Translation of Genesis 50 . At the end of his life, Joseph of Egypt prophesied that the Lord would raise up two prophets, who are descended from Jacob, to help deliver His people out of bondage. Moses would come to deliver the Israelites out of physical bondage in Egypt (see JST Genesis 50:24, 29 ). Then, in the latter days, the Lord would deliver His people from spiritual darkness through the Prophet Joseph Smith. To help students assess what they know and believe about Joseph Smith, consider inviting them to answer the following questions in their study journals. What thoughts or feelings come to mind when you think about the Prophet Joseph Smith? How would you describe the current state of your testimony that he was called by God to be a prophet? As you study today, listen for impressions from the Spirit confirming that the Lord called Joseph Smith as a prophet. Heavenly Father can send thoughts to your mind or feelings to your heart through the Holy Ghost telling you that what you are studying is true. Joseph of Egypt prophesies of Joseph Smith Invite students to create a blank chart similar to the one below in their study journals. Students may work in pairs or small groups to complete the chart. You could use the information provided in the chart to show how this can be done and help students discover answers as needed. You might help students locate the Joseph Smith Translation Appendix in their scriptures or in Study Helps in Gospel Library. You might also remind students that a seer is a revelator and prophet who knows the past, present, and future (see Mosiah 8:17 ), the “fruit of thy loins” ( JST Genesis 50:27 ) refers to Joseph of Egypt’s posterity or descendants, the writings of Joseph’s seed refers to the Book of Mormon, and the writings of Judah’s seed refers to the Bible (see JST Genesis 50:31 ). Read Joseph Smith Translation Genesis 50:26–33 to complete the following chart. Prophecy about Joseph Smith (including the verse): Possible ways this prophecy was fulfilled: Prophecy about Joseph Smith (including the verse): “He shall be esteemed highly” ( verse 27 ) Possible ways this prophecy was fulfilled: Millions of believers consider Joseph Smith to be the Prophet of the Restoration. Prophecy about Joseph Smith (including the verse): “He shall bring them to the knowledge of the covenants which I have made with thy fathers” ( verse 28 ) Possible ways this prophecy was fulfilled: Through the restored priesthood, we can make covenants with God through baptismal and other ordinances. One of the purposes of the Book of Mormon is to bring the House of Israel to a knowledge of the covenants of the Lord. Prophecy about Joseph Smith (including the verse): “Unto him will I give power to bring forth my word” ( verse 30 ) Possible ways this prophecy was fulfilled: The Lord revealed the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Joseph Smith Translation, and other inspired writings through Joseph Smith. Prophecy about Joseph Smith (including the verse): “Out of weakness shall he be made strong” ( verse 32 ) Possible ways this prophecy was fulfilled: From humble beginnings and little formal education, Joseph Smith became a mighty prophet. Prophecy about Joseph Smith (including the verse): “They that seek to destroy him shall be confounded” ( verse 33 ) Possible ways this prophecy was fulfilled: Those who seek to discredit Joseph Smith and his work will be unsuccessful. As part of your discussion, you could point out that the phrase “raised up” is used seven times in these verses. Some possible meanings for this phrase are called, chosen, or prepared to do a work that would bring the Lord’s people unto salvation ( verse 33 ). You could also invite students to identify another pattern by marking each time the Lord is the one doing the action, such as “will I raise up” ( verse 27 ) or “will I give power” ( verse 30 ). What prophecies stood out to you in these verses? Why? Among possible truths the students may identify, point out the following: The Lord chose and prepared Joseph Smith to bring forth the Book of Mormon. Invite students to consider writing this truth next to verses 30–33 . What truths can you identify about the Lord from what you studied about Joseph Smith? How do you think the Book of Mormon brings the Lord’s people unto salvation? How has the Book of Mormon blessed your life? Gaining a spiritual witness of the Prophet Joseph Smith Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught: Each believer needs a spiritual confirmation of the divine mission and character of the Prophet Joseph Smith. This is true for every generation. (“ Joseph Smith ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2014, 29–30) Why do you think it is important for each of us to receive a spiritual confirmation from Heavenly Father, through the Holy Ghost, about Joseph Smith’s divine mission? Share the following statement by Elder Andersen or show the video “ Joseph Smith ” on ChurchofJesusChrist.org from time code 11:44 to 12:48. 14:49 Elder Andersen shared two ways we can gain or strengthen our testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. To the youth listening today or reading these words in the days ahead, I give a specific challenge: Gain a personal witness of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Let your voice help fulfill Moroni’s prophetic words to speak good of the Prophet. Here are two ideas: First, find scriptures in the Book of Mormon that you feel and know are absolutely true. Then share them with family and friends in family home evening, seminary, and your Young Men and Young Women classes, acknowledging that Joseph was an instrument in God’s hands. Next, read the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Pearl of Great Price. … This is Joseph’s own testimony of what actually occurred. Read it often. (“ Joseph Smith ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2014, 30) After sharing this statement, invite students to choose one of Elder Andersen’s suggestions to strengthen their personal witness that the Lord called Joseph Smith as a prophet. Option 1: Find one or more personally meaningful scriptures in the Book of Mormon. Create a picture or write a paragraph highlighting your selection. Include your thoughts and feelings about how the Book of Mormon and its teachings help you learn about and love the Savior. Also include how this helps confirm that Joseph was an instrument in God’s hands. Option 2: Read Joseph Smith’s testimony as recorded in Joseph Smith History 1:15–20 and the testimony of Joseph Smith recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 135:3 . Create a picture or write a paragraph about what you have learned and felt about how the Savior chose and prepared Joseph Smith to be the prophet of the Restoration. Testify of the Prophet Joseph Smith When students have completed the activity, invite them to share what they created with a class member. Then, you might invite a few willing students to testify about how Jesus Christ called Joseph Smith to be a prophet. The following questions can help. What have you learned today that has strengthened your testimony of Joseph Smith? How does having a testimony of Joseph Smith strengthen your testimony of Jesus Christ? Consider closing with your testimony of the work the Lord performed through Joseph Smith. Invite students to continue to listen for impressions from the Spirit to know for themselves that Jesus Christ called Joseph Smith to be a prophet.\n\n\n--- Lesson 37 ---\nReflecting on and assessing our spiritual learning can help us draw closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. This lesson is intended to help students reflect on the goals they have set and the growth they have experienced during their study of Genesis 12–50 and Abraham 1–2 . Student preparation: Invite students to come ready to share ways they have grown spiritually from their study of the Old Testament and the Pearl of Great Price this year. You might suggest that they review their study journals or notes in their scriptures to help them notice their growth and learning. Possible Learning Activities Your class’s study of Abraham 1–2 and Genesis 12–50 may have focused on different outcomes than the outcomes assessed in this lesson. If so, adapt the activities to assess the growth students experienced from the outcomes your class focused on. In this lesson, students will have the opportunity to assess their progress in the following three areas: Explain the importance of eternal marriage in Heavenly Father’s plan. ( Note: This activity is based on teachings from Lesson 9: “ Genesis 1:28–2:25 ” and Lesson 29: “ Genesis 24 .”) Feel an increased desire to make and keep covenants with God. ( Note: This activity is based on teachings from Lesson 23: “ Genesis 12, 17 ” and Lesson 31: “ Genesis 28 .”) Participate in the gathering of Israel. ( Note: This activity is based on teachings from Lesson 24: “ Abraham 2:9–11 .”) Becoming more like Jesus Christ Identifying how they are growing spiritually can help students in their efforts to become disciples of Jesus Christ. To help them do this, consider displaying the following images. Alternatively, students could draw a picture of two trees in their study journals: a young tree and a mature tree. Imagine that these are pictures of the same tree taken a few years apart from each other. In your study journals, list any evidence you see that the tree is growing. Students could work in partnerships or small groups to share their lists and to answer the following questions. How can we compare these images of a tree to our spiritual growth to become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? What are some ways we can recognize how we are growing spiritually and becoming more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Explain that we can identify spiritual growth by reviewing what we have learned about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and how it has helped us improve our relationship with Them. Invite students to take a few minutes to review what they have learned and applied from their seminary experience this year. They could do this by looking through their scriptures and notes. What are you learning in seminary that is helping you grow spiritually and become more like Jesus Christ? What evidence of spiritual growth have you noticed in your life? Explain the importance of eternal marriage in Heavenly Father’s plan This exercise can help students explain the importance of eternal marriage in Heavenly Father’s plan. Invite students to turn to the image they may have drawn in Lesson 29: “ Genesis 24 .” Give students time to review what they learned about marriage in Lesson 9: “ Genesis 1:28–2:25 ” and Lesson 29: “ Genesis 24 .” Students could review any notes or insights they recorded in their study journals. They could also review the following verses and anything they may have marked in them: Genesis 1:27–28 Genesis 2:18, 21–24 Doctrine and Covenants 49:15–17 Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4 To help students explain their understanding of eternal marriage, share a scenario like the following. You can adjust the scenario to meet the needs of your students. Today at school, you were talking about future plans with some friends. You mentioned marriage as one of your plans. One of your friends asked: “It seems like you have a lot of potential for a career. Why do you want to get married?” Using what you have learned about eternal marriage in Heavenly Father’s plan, how would you respond to your friend? Students might take a few minutes to plan their responses. Encourage students to find a few scriptures they have studied in the Old Testament or other places. Ask them to share those scriptures as part of their explanations. Consider placing students in partnerships. Invite each student to practice explaining what they would say to their friend. Feel an increased desire to make and keep covenants with God Students may have drawn a picture of Jacob’s dream as part of Lesson 31: “ Genesis 28 .” They could refer to their pictures as part of their review of covenants. You could also display the following image. Invite students to recall what they remember from the event depicted about making and keeping covenants (see also Lesson 23: “ Genesis 12, 17 ”). If helpful, students could review Genesis 28:10–21 . You might want to remind students that Jacob made covenants with God after leaving his parents’ home and starting life on his own. As part of Lesson 31: Genesis 28 , students reflected on the opportunity they will have to make covenants with God in the temple. Students may have written answers in their study journals to the following questions: What promised blessings have you experienced from striving to keep your covenants with God or by serving in the temple? What situations might you face in the future where you would benefit from the care and protection God promises to people who make covenants with Him? If relevant, invite students to review the answers they recorded. After sufficient time, provide students with paper and envelopes for the following activity. Using what you have learned about making and keeping covenants with God, write a letter to yourself that you could open at the end of high school. Write about why you feel it is important to make and keep covenants with God in the temple and throughout your life. Include how making covenants with God can increase your access to His guidance, care, and protection. Participate in the gathering of Israel In Lesson 24: “ Abraham 2:9–11 ,” students may have made a plan to participate in the gathering of Israel. If so, give students time to review their plans. Their plans may have included ways to share the gospel, to help others make or keep covenants with the Lord, or to bless others through temple and family history work. Students who haven’t yet created a plan can use the following visual to begin making one. You may have made plans to participate in the gathering of Israel. Reflect on these plans by filling out the following graphic in your study journal. Invite a few willing students to share what experiences they have had acting on their plans and how those experiences have affected them. Ask students to share how participating in the gathering of Israel has influenced their feelings for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Invite students to continue to seek the help of the Holy Ghost to know ways they can participate in the gathering of Israel. Encourage students who may not have acted on a plan to begin now. Testify of the blessings the Lord will give them and others as they carry out their plans.",

This lesson can help students desire to put God above other pressures. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to ask a family member or friend how they have seen God bless them for following Him rather than others. Possible Learning Activities Christlike courage Consider sharing the following from President Nelson. President Russell M. Nelson described characteristics of disciples of Jesus Christ: 14:51 True disciples of Jesus Christ are willing to stand out, speak up, and be different from the people of the world. They are undaunted, devoted, and courageous. (“ Drawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives , ” Ensign or Liahona , May 2017, 40–41) Why might it take courage to act in the way President Nelson described? Why do you think it is important to follow President Nelson’s counsel? Display the following self-assessment to help students ponder how they feel about obeying God rather than giving in to other pressures. Read the following statements and rate how true they are of you on a scale from 1 (not true at all) to 5 (very true). I am willing to put the Lord first, even when I feel pressure from others to lower my standards. I am unsure if God will bless me for striving to obey His commandments. I am willing to stand up for what I know is right, even if it isn’t the popular choice. Encourage students to pay attention to impressions from the Spirit as they study Exodus 1 . The Spirit can help them prepare to act with courage when they feel pressure to do things that are against God’s will. Righteous examples Consider inviting the students to share what they know about what happened to the Israelites after the death of Joseph of Egypt. As needed, use some or all of the following summary. After Joseph of Egypt died, the Israelites (also called the Hebrews) grew in number in the land of Egypt. Fearing that the Israelites could overpower the Egyptians, the new pharaoh enslaved them (see Exodus 1:6–14 ). Read Exodus 1:15–16 , looking for what Pharaoh commanded Shiphrah and Puah, two Hebrew midwives, to do. “Midwives” refers to women who assist in childbirth. “Stools” ( verse 16 ) refers to seats used by women who are giving birth. Invite students to share what they found. Find ways to help students relate to the pressure these women may have felt to do what others wanted rather than what God wanted. The following question and activity is one way to do this. If you were Shiphrah or Puah, what might have made it difficult for you to put God’s will above Pharaoh’s? Consider separating the class into groups. Invite groups to identify circumstances they have faced or might face where it could be difficult to choose God’s will because of other pressures. Have them create a list of reasons why someone might be concerned about following God in those circumstances. Read Exodus 1:17–21 , looking for why Shiphrah and Puah made the decisions they did. What did you find? What in these verses could motivate someone who might wonder whether they should put God above other pressures they face? As students share, you might want to tell them that “fearing God” (see verses 17, 21 ) means to revere or respect God. Point out the phrase “God dealt well” with Shiphrah and Puah ( verse 20 ) if students do not identify it. Invite students to mark this phrase. This means that God blessed Shiphrah and Puah for putting Him above the pressures they faced. According to footnote b in verse 21 , one blessing the Lord gave Shiphrah and Puah was descendants. What truth can we learn from Shiphrah and Puah that can help us when we face pressures to follow others rather than God? Using their own words, students could identify a truth like as we submit our will to God instead of bending to other pressures, He will bless us. Although the rest of the lesson focuses on how “God [deals] well” with us, you might consider taking time to focus on the Savior’s example of submitting to Heavenly Father’s will. You could use a question like the following to do that. If students have a hard time coming up with examples, you might direct them to John 6:38 or Luke 22:42 . What has the Savior taught or done that shows how He is the perfect example of this truth? Think of an activity to help students understand ways the Lord might deal well with (bless) them for revering Him by putting Him first. Here are two ideas. Choose one of these or another of your choice to help students answer the following questions. Share with students the video “ Leave the Party ” (6:26) or the video “ Be Valiant in Courage, Strength, and Activity ” from time code 1:20 to 5:13 (both videos are available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). Invite students to identify how the Lord blessed John for putting God above other pressures. 6:26 10:35 Provide students with a few scriptures to study that show ways God has dealt well with others for choosing Him over other pressures. They could study 2 Nephi 5:6–13 ; Mosiah 24:11–15 ; 4 Nephi 1:15–18 . Students could also find other scriptures that illustrate how God deals well with His children when they put Him first. What might it look like when “God [deals] well” with us? How has God dealt well with you or someone you know for submitting to His will instead of bending to other pressures? Why is it worth it to you to choose to put God first no matter the outcome? Submitting our will to God Consider displaying the following questions to help students think about what they have learned or felt today and how it can help them when they face difficult situations. Choose one of the following questions to respond to in your study journal: What have you learned or felt today that can help you be confident that God will bless you when you choose to put Him first? What would you share with someone who is unsure if it is worth choosing God when we face other pressures? Consider giving students an opportunity to share what they wrote. You might also share the Savior’s promise to people who are persecuted for choosing Him, found in Matthew 5:10–12 . Consider sharing your testimony of how God will bless us when we choose to follow Him, even when it is difficult.\n\n\n--- Lesson 39 ---\nWhen we face difficulties, the Lord lovingly guides us through His prophets. Under Pharaoh’s reign, the children of Israel struggled in bondage and cried unto the Lord. The Lord heard their cries and called Moses as a prophet to help them. This lesson can help students more fully incorporate the Lord’s words through His prophets into their lives. Student preparation: Invite students to review recent teachings from the prophet. Then invite them to discuss with a family member or friend how following the prophet’s teachings has blessed their lives. Possible Learning Activities Which voices to trust Consider beginning class by sharing this statement and asking the following questions. Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles observed: 16:4 We live on a planet clamoring with a million voices. The internet, our smartphones, our bloated boxes of entertainment all plead for our attention and thrust their influence upon us. (“ The Prophet of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 26) List of a few examples of the voices you have seen or heard over the last several days. What do you notice about the different sources of information? How are the words of prophets different from other voices? Consider displaying the following self-evaluation statements and invite students to think about their answers. For each of the following statements, rate yourself using a scale from 1 (not true at all) to 5 (very true): I place more trust in the words of prophets and apostles than in other voices or influences. I have confidence in the counsel and direction we receive from the Lord’s prophets and apostles. I make efforts to study the words of today’s prophets and apostles. As students study today, invite them to listen for impressions from the Spirit about how they can more fully follow the counsel of prophets and apostles in their lives. The Lord calls Moses to be a prophet To help students understand how the Lord prepared Moses to be His prophet, consider inviting students to share what they know about Moses’s early life. You could display an image of the baby Moses to help students recall what they know. You could also show the video “ Baby Moses ” (1:37), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 1:36 The following paragraphs contain details that may be helpful as students summarize. Although he was an Israelite by birth, the prophet Moses was raised in the household of Pharaoh in Egypt. When Moses was an infant, Pharaoh commanded that all newborn Israelite boys should be killed (see Exodus 1:22 ). To save Moses, his mother hid him in a basket and placed it next to a river. Moses was discovered by Pharaoh’s daughter, who raised him as her son (see Exodus 2:1–10 ). In Egypt, Moses was well educated and “mighty in words and in deeds” ( Acts 7:22 ). As a grown man, Moses killed an Egyptian while defending one of the Israelite slaves. Moses fled to Midian, where he lived with a high priest named Jethro and married his daughter, Zipporah (see Exodus 2:11–21 ). While tending sheep in Midian, Moses had an experience with Jehovah. Show the following picture. Invite students to imagine they were Moses as they read the following verses and answer the following questions in small groups. They can then share highlights of what they learned as a class. Exodus 3:1–6 . How would you feel? Why? Exodus 3:7–14 . Which of the Lord’s teachings may have been most meaningful or comforting to you? To help students focus on Jesus Christ as they study these verses, consider displaying an image of the Savior on the center of the board. You could invite students to write phrases about the Savior around the picture, describing through His words what we can learn about Him and His relationship with Moses and the children of Israel. Examples of insights could include that Jesus called Moses by name ( verse 4 ), Jesus’s presence made the ground holy ( verse 5 ), Jesus saw the afflictions and heard the cries of His people ( verse 7 ), and Jesus promised to be with Moses ( verse 12 ). If students do not mention it, point out the title “I AM” ( Exodus 3:14 ). Explain that it comes from the same root word as Jehovah, which can be interpreted as “He is” or “He exists.” The name would have been easily recognized by the Israelites. To help students understand the significance of this name, you might ask why it would be meaningful to know that the Lord truly exists and is always present. After students share their responses, you could ask the following question. If you had been in Moses’s situation, what questions or concerns might you have had? Explain that despite the Lord’s declaration of who He is and what He promises, Moses still had concerns about his call to deliver Israel. Read Exodus 4:10–15 , looking for how the Lord addressed Moses’s concerns. What do you learn about the words of prophets from these verses? Help students identify the truth that the Lord speaks His words through His prophets. How could knowing this truth affect your life or your decisions? To help students better understand this truth, you might show one of the following videos: “ Why Do We Have Prophets? ” (1:37) “ Listen to a Prophet ” from time code 0:53 to 2:56 1:37 2:56 Recall the beginning of the lesson and the various voices hoping to gain our attention. Think about what you could share with someone else to help them understand that the Lord speaks through prophets and that we should listen to prophets over other voices. You could include what you learned from Exodus 3 and any experiences you, or someone you know, have had that have helped you know that the Lord speaks His words through His prophets. Invite students to share what they might say. A possible follow-up question is “How has this understanding blessed you or someone you know?” Applying the words of the Lord’s prophets in our lives What are some ways we could hear and apply the Lord’s words, given through His prophets, in our lives? Encourage several students to share examples of applying the prophets’ teachings. If useful, share a few ideas like: Applying specific prophetic counsel from a recent general conference talk. Studying the words of prophets more often, like listening to a general conference talk each morning while preparing for school. Creating a plan to study the most recent general conference talks of each of the members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. (If students have digital access, they could use the Study Plans feature on the Gospel Library app.) Write in your study journal how you will hear and apply the word of the Lord through His prophets in your personal life. As part of your plan, record what obstacles you think you might face. For each obstacle, write how you might overcome it. Explain to students that they will have an opportunity in a future lesson, Lesson 55: “ Assess Your Learning 3 ,” to assess how they are doing at implementing their plans. Close by sharing your testimony that the Lord speaks through His living prophets today.\n\n\n--- Lesson 40 ---\nAfter the Lord called him to deliver Israel from Egyptian captivity, Moses asked Pharaoh to let the Lord’s people go. Pharaoh refused and instead increased the Israelites’ burden. Despite Pharaoh’s response, Moses continued to follow what the Lord asked him to do. This lesson can help students recognize that the Lord’s promises can motivate them to do His will, regardless of the immediate outcome. Student preparation: Invite students to come to class prepared to share their answers to the following question: Does following Jesus Christ make your life easier or harder? Possible Learning Activities Following Jesus Christ Invite students to consider how they would respond if someone asked them the following question. Does following Jesus Christ make your life easier or harder? To discuss this question, you could write Easier and Harder as headings on the board and list students’ reasons for their response under the appropriate heading. Consider having a few students explain their responses. Moses asks Pharaoh to set the Israelites free You might want to point out that in Exodus 5–7 , Moses and the Israelites may have wondered if following the Savior makes life easier or harder. To help students understand the context of Exodus 5–7 , consider inviting class members to share what they remember about Moses and the children of Israel from Lesson 39: “ Exodus 2–4 .” If needed, invite a student to read the following summary. The children of Israel had been in bondage to the Egyptians for many generations. The Lord heard His people’s cry and called Moses to help deliver them from bondage (see Exodus 3:9–10 ). Read Exodus 5:1–2 , looking for what Moses and Aaron told Pharaoh from the Lord. What was Pharaoh’s response? Consider writing on the board Pharaoh’s response: “Who is the Lord?” You might ask students why this question is important for us to answer for ourselves. The next section of the lesson will refer to this question. In his anger, Pharaoh made the lives of the Israelites harder by increasing their daily workload (see Exodus 5:6–9 , including footnote 8 a , 15–19). The Israelites complained to Moses and Aaron about their increased burdens (see Exodus 5:20–21 ). If you were Moses, how might you have felt? Read Exodus 5:22–23 , thinking about how you might summarize what Moses is saying to the Lord. How might we relate to Moses in Exodus 5:22–23 ? Students may share how they feel when they don’t see immediate blessings after obeying the Lord. Validate their answers and feelings. Display the following self-assessment, and invite students to ponder their responses. Complete the following sentence in a way that best reflects your feelings. You might select more than one answer: When I don’t see immediate blessings after obeying Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, I feel … If students would benefit from prompts to this self-assessment, you might write some of the following words on the board for them to choose from: frustrated , confused , angry , disappointed , resolved , hopeful , confident , peaceful . They could also add what they might do in this situation. As you continue to learn today, look for truths about Jesus Christ that can help you follow Him even when it is hard and the blessings are not immediate. Pay attention to impressions from the Holy Ghost that can help you in your personal circumstances. The Lord’s promises As students read the following passages, consider inviting them to mark all the statements in which the Lord refers to Himself (statements beginning with I , I am , I will , and I have ). Marking scriptures can help students notice and remember important insights and truths they learn. Read Exodus 6:1–8 ; 7:1–2, 5 , looking for what the Lord taught Moses about Himself. After students have had time to read and mark, they could discuss the following question with a partner. Questions that help students assess what they are learning can help a teacher identify when students are ready to move on in the lesson. One way to do this is to ask questions about what students have read in the scriptures, such as the one below. For additional training on asking questions that assess learning, see “ Always be ready to respond to spiritual promptings about the needs of learners ” in Teacher Development Skills . What are you learning about the Lord from His promises to Moses? Students could write their answers under “Who is the Lord?” on the board. Students’ answers could include the following list: He is God Almighty ( 6:2–3 ). He remembers and keeps His promises ( 6:3–5 ). He promised to free the Israelites from bondage ( 6:6 ; 7:5 ), give them the land of Canaan ( 6:4, 8 ), and be their God ( 6:7 ) Continuing to do the Lord’s will Recall how Moses felt previously. Read Exodus 7:6 , and mark what Moses and Aaron did after learning from the Lord and hearing His promises. If you were Moses, which of the promises from the Lord would have helped you go back to Pharaoh? Why? What truth can we learn from Moses’s experience? Using their own words, students could identify a truth similar to the following: When we believe the Lord and His promises, we can trust and follow Him even when we don’t see the immediate outcome. To help students understand how this truth can apply to situations they might face, consider sharing the following statement. Willing students could read each paragraph aloud to the class. Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles provided important counsel for us as we await the Lord’s promised blessings: 13:17 Some misunderstand the promises of God to mean that obedience to Him yields specific outcomes on a fixed schedule. They might think, “If I diligently serve a full-time mission, God will bless me with a happy marriage and children” or “If I refrain from doing schoolwork on the Sabbath, God will bless me with good grades” or “If I pay tithing, God will bless me with that job I’ve been wanting.” … We ought not to think of God’s plan as a cosmic vending machine where we (1) select a desired blessing, (2) insert the required sum of good works, and (3) the order is promptly delivered. God will indeed honor His covenants and promises to each of us. We need not worry about that. The atoning power of Jesus Christ … ensures that God can and will fulfill His promises. It is essential that we honor and obey His laws, but not every blessing predicated on obedience to law is shaped, designed, and timed according to our expectations. We do our best but must leave to Him the management of blessings, both temporal and spiritual. (“ Our Relationship with God ,” Liahona , May 2022, 78) What stood out to you from this statement? Remind students that one thing we learned about the Lord is that He remembers and keeps His promises (see Exodus 6:3–5 ). Explain that the Lord fulfilled His promises to Moses (see Exodus 20:2 ; Deuteronomy 7:6 ; 14:2 ; Joshua 24:5–7, 13 ). If you have sufficient time, you could write these references on the board and have students match the fulfillment to the promise. Just as the Lord taught Moses more about Himself by reiterating His promises, we can also better know the Lord by identifying promises He has made to us. Reviewing these promises can help us to obey Him, even if we do not receive immediate results. Identify three promises the Lord has made to you in the scriptures or from recent teachings through His chosen servants. You might find promises in: Doctrinal mastery passages or other scriptures. For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices . Recent general conference talks. After sufficient time, you could invite willing students to share what they learned or felt as they studied some of the promises. Encourage students to continue to trust the Lord regardless of the immediate outcome.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 41 ---\nIt can be difficult to recognize the Lord’s power in our lives. The Lord selected Moses and Aaron to demonstrate His power before Pharaoh. Pharaoh dismissed the Lord’s power. This prompted additional demonstrations of the Lord’s power through plagues that came upon Egypt. The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to recognize the Lord’s power and believe in Him. Student preparation: Invite students to look for evidence of the Lord’s power in their lives between now and the next class. Possible Learning Activities God’s power around us Consider beginning class by asking the following questions or having students discuss them in groups. On your way to seminary today, what are things you saw, noticed, or observed? On a scale of 1–5 (1 being not at all, 5 being very much), how would you rate your awareness of your surroundings today? What are some reasons we may be more or less observant? Explain that in a similar way, we can ponder how observant we are to what the Lord has done or is doing for us. Consider asking the following: What evidence might someone notice of God’s power in an ordinary day? One way to invite the Holy Ghost to teach students individually is by allowing students to privately assess how they feel they are doing with specific gospel principles. You could help them do this by displaying the following: Rate yourself on a scale of 1–5 (1 being lowest, 5 being highest) on how well the following describes you: I feel confident in my ability to recognize God’s power or influence in my life. As you learn today, invite the Holy Ghost to help you increase your ability to recognize God’s power and influence in your life. Believing in the Lord In Exodus 6–7 , the Lord promised Moses that He would bring the Israelites out of bondage. He declared that He would manifest His power to Pharaoh and the Egyptians and that they would have no choice but to set the Israelites free. Read Exodus 6:7 ; 7:5 , looking for what the Lord would make sure that both the Israelites and the Egyptians would know. Students may want to mark what they find. What would the Israelites and Egyptians come to know because of the manifestations of the Lord’s power? What can we learn about the Lord from these declarations? Help students identify a truth similar to the Lord gives us opportunities to believe in Him and recognize His power in our lives . The plagues The following activity can give students the opportunity to become familiar with some of the Egyptian plagues. It can also help them to see different responses to the manifestations of God’s power. Be cautious to not spend so much time in this section that it would take away from the remainder of the lesson. Consider displaying the following chart and questions. In Exodus 7–11 , the Lord manifested His power through a series of plagues. Look at the following chart and select two or three plagues to study, looking for answers to the questions that follow. Some verses say that the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart. The Joseph Smith Translation provides important clarification that Pharaoh hardened his own heart (see Joseph Smith Translation, footnotes to Exodus 7:3, 13 ; 9:12 ; 10:1, 20, 27 ; 11:10 ). Plague Verses to study Plague 1. Water turned to blood Verses to study Exodus 7:19–25 Plague 2. Frogs come upon the land Verses to study Exodus 8:5–15 ( Note: “Respite” means rest or relief) Plague 3. Lice Verses to study Exodus 8:16–19 Plague 4. Flies Verses to study Exodus 8:20–25, 29–32 Plague 5. Cattle die Verses to study Exodus 9:1–7 Plague 6. Boils Verses to study Exodus 9:8–12 Plague 7. Hail and fire from the sky Verses to study Exodus 9:22–29, 33–35 Plague 8. Locusts Verses to study Exodus 10:12–20 Plague 9. Darkness Verses to study Exodus 10:21–27 In what ways was the Lord’s power manifest? Why do you think individuals believed or did not believe in the Lord and His power? After sufficient time, consider inviting students to share their findings in pairs or small groups. It may be helpful to clarify some of the following. Students may have noticed that Pharaoh’s magicians, either through deception or the power of the adversary, were able to replicate some portion of the first two plagues. They were not, however, able to fully replicate or stop the plagues. Additionally, the Israelites apparently suffered from some plagues but were protected from the fourth, fifth, and seventh plagues. If useful, you could encourage students to mark additional phrases in Exodus 8:10, 22 ; 10:2 where the Lord testified that the people would know He is the Lord. Why do you think the Lord wanted the Egyptians and Israelites to learn about Him? What are reasons people at times believe in God and His power and later have doubts? The Lord’s power in our lives It could be helpful to share with students that the Lord’s power is manifest in many ways today. The following could help students think about how they have seen or experienced that power. Imagine you have a friend who isn’t confident that they have ever had an experience with Heavenly Father or felt His power. As you continue your study, think about what you would say to this person. It may be helpful to give students time to ponder or write their thoughts on the following question before they share with the class. What are ways you have come to believe in the Lord’s power? Or what are things that could help you believe? What are examples from the scriptures or Church history where people were shown the Lord’s power? Students might share examples such as feeling comfort or peace from prayer or a priesthood blessing, experiencing forgiveness, feeling personal guidance from the Holy Ghost, and so on. Help students understand that experiences with the Lord’s power generally result from demonstrating faithful attitudes or actions. President Russell M. Nelson taught the following about what we can do to invite experiences with Heavenly Father: Understand that in the absence of experiences with God, one can doubt the existence of God. So, put yourself in a position to begin having experiences with Him. Humble yourself. Pray to have eyes to see God’s hand in your life and in the world around you. Ask Him to tell you if He is really there—if He knows you. Ask Him how He feels about you. And then listen. (“ Come, Follow Me ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 90) What could a person do to begin seeing God’s hand and power in their life? You might invite students to role-play how they could respond to the scenario above. Have them counsel their friend who isn’t confident that they have ever had an experience with the Lord or felt His power. Consider bearing testimony of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and the importance of recognizing Their power in our lives.\n\n\n--- Lesson 42 ---\nTo free the Israelites, Jehovah (Jesus Christ) sent one final plague—death to all the firstborn children in Egypt. He then gave instructions so the plague would “pass over” anyone who obediently put their trust in Him (see Exodus 12:13 ). Jesus Christ instituted the Passover meal as a symbolic reminder of the saving power of His Atonement. This lesson can help students feel the importance of the Savior and His Atonement in their lives. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder the symbols of Jesus Christ that they have studied in the past. Ask them to consider what those symbols teach about Him. Then invite them to choose one symbol and explain to someone what it teaches about Jesus Christ. Possible Learning Activities The need to be rescued Consider beginning class by reading or summarizing an account about someone who was trapped and could not free themselves. The following account is one way to do this. (For more details, see “ Timeline: Thai cave rescue that transfixed the world for 17 days ,” June 24, 2019, reuters.com .) On June 23, 2018, 12 members of a youth soccer team, ages 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old assistant coach decided to explore an elaborate cave system in northern Thailand following a practice. Shortly after they entered, heavy rains flooded the caves, trapping them four kilometers (2.5 miles) within the caves and cutting off contact with the outside world for more than a week. How might you feel if you were in their situation? On July 2, experienced divers finally located the young group. But floodwaters and additional rain made immediate rescue nearly impossible. While the boys and their coach received life-sustaining assistance, experts debated options. They could try bringing out the boys with diving equipment, but the path was treacherous and required expert skill. They could also attempt to drill through the rock, look for another escape route, or wait months for the water to subside. With more monsoon rains coming, the soccer team’s deliverance from the caves remained uncertain. In a spiritual sense, how might we feel trapped, stuck, or hopeless? Students might point out that we all need the Savior’s help to deliver us from sin, death, and other difficulties in our lives. To help students assess their reliance on the Savior and His Atonement, you could invite them to answer the following questions in their study journals. Take a moment to ponder any sins or difficulties you are struggling with right now. Consider how you feel about these sins or difficulties. Then answer the following questions: What do I believe about the Lord’s ability to deliver me from my sins and other difficulties I might face? How do I feel about what He has done and is willing to do for me? In this lesson, you will learn how the Savior delivered the Israelites from bondage in Egypt. As you study, invite the Holy Ghost to help you understand that the Savior is also your Deliverer. The symbolism of the Passover You might ask students to recount how the Lord used nine plagues to convince the Israelites and Egyptians that He is God. Read Exodus 11:4–6 , looking for the tenth and final plague. What did you discover? The Lord promised the Israelites that if they would faithfully obey His instructions, He would cause the plague to “pass over” them, and their firstborn children would not die (see Exodus 12:13, 23 ). For this reason, the Lord referred to this event as the Passover (see Exodus 12:43 ). The Lord’s instructions involved a meal, including what to prepare and how to eat it. The Savior used symbols in the Passover meal to teach the Israelites about Himself. Provide an activity to help students identify the instructions the Lord gave the Israelites for the Passover meal. Also help students discover what these instructions might teach about the Lord and the deliverance He offers. You might create a chart on the board with the following headings. Students could duplicate the chart in their study journals and complete it in small groups. Possible answers are included here for your reference. Complete one item as a class to model how students can complete the chart in their groups. Study Exodus 12:3–8, 15, 21–23 and fill out the following chart in your study journal. What instructions did the Lord give the Israelites? What might this instruction symbolize? What instructions did the Lord give the Israelites? Kill a male lamb, without blemish, to eat ( 3–6, 21 ). What might this instruction symbolize? Jesus Christ, “the Lamb of God” ( John 1:36 ), was perfect and gave His life for us. What instructions did the Lord give the Israelites? Place the blood of the lamb on the door posts of the entrance to the house ( 7, 22 ). What might this instruction symbolize? The Atonement of Jesus Christ can protect us as we apply the conditions of repentance in our lives. What instructions did the Lord give the Israelites? Eat lamb with bitter herbs and unleavened bread, remove leaven (yeast) from the house ( 8, 15 ). What might this instruction symbolize? Bitter herbs were a reminder of the Israelites’ bitter bondage in Egypt and is like the bitterness of sin. Leaven, or yeast, can make bread moldy. As part of repentance, we can rid our lives of anything that can corrupt our spirits. When students finish, give them an opportunity to share what they learned. You might show the picture at the beginning of the lesson. Students could point out the different Passover items shown in the picture and discuss what they might symbolize. Jesus Christ delivers us from spiritual and physical death Read Exodus 12:50–51 ; 13:3 to see what happened as the children of Israel kept the Passover. Write the following truth on the board: The Savior delivers His people from spiritual and physical death. Explain that the Passover symbolizes this truth. As part of Heavenly Father’s plan, all people need to be saved from physical death (separation of body and spirit; see 2 Nephi 9:6, 11 ) and spiritual death (separation from God because of sin; see Helaman 14:16–19 ). To help students understand the saving power of Jesus Christ, you may want to have students read some of these verses in the Book of Mormon. You might also read or summarize the remainder of the account of the Thai soccer team. Recall the story of the trapped soccer players from earlier. After several intense days, experts from around the world determined a method for rescuing them. Experienced divers entered the dangerous waters of the elaborate cave system and, one by one, delivered the boys and their coach from the flooded caves. How might the experienced divers’ actions symbolize what the Savior can do for us? Jesus Christ’s Atonement matters to me The following activity can help students understand and feel the importance of the Savior’s power to deliver us. Divide the class into pairs. Invite each pair to role-play the following scenario. If you feel your students might struggle to imagine that they were ancient Israelites, skip that portion of the activity, and have both partners discuss the questions for a modern-day teen. In pairs, imagine one of you is an Israelite teen who just participated in the first Passover in Egypt and the other is a modern-day teen. Use the following questions to interview each other. Questions for the Israelite teen How would you describe your experience in bondage before the Passover? What did you learn from your experience the night of the Passover? How did Jehovah change your life? What would you share about Jehovah with people who may be reluctant to follow Him? Questions for the modern-day teen How is sin similar to bondage? How are trials similar to bondage? How has Jesus Christ changed your life? What would you want others to know about the saving power of Jesus Christ? Invite students to review their answers to the self-assessment questions from the beginning of the lesson. Ask them to consider what impressions they’ve felt from the Spirit about the Savior and His power to deliver them. Students could add their insights to what they wrote earlier. You might invite a few students to share their thoughts about Jesus Christ and His atoning power to deliver.\n\n\n--- Lesson 43 ---\nWhy do you think it’s important to remember Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? To help the children of Israel remember that He delivered them from Egypt, the Lord instituted the Feast of the Passover. Jesus Christ gave us a new way to always remember Him when He instituted the ordinance of the sacrament. This lesson can help students remember the Savior as they prepare for and participate in the ordinance of the sacrament. Student preparation: Invite students to prepare to share something that has helped them remember the Savior before, during, or after the sacrament. This could include a favorite picture, scripture, hymn, or quote. Possible Learning Activities Always remember To help students recognize the importance of remembering, display a picture or object that helps you remember something or someone important to you. This could be something like a wedding ring, a picture, or a memento. Briefly share how this item helps you remember the person or event. Then invite students to answer the following questions. What is something or who is someone you want to remember throughout your life? Why? What are some things you do or have done to help you remember this thing or person? You could then display an image of Jesus Christ. Invite students to look at the image as they prayerfully think about the Savior. Then you could display the following questions for students to answer in their study journals. How do you feel about the Savior? What do you feel is important to remember about Him? Why? As you study today, seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to help you know what you can do to remember the Savior and what He has done for you. “This day shall be unto you for a memorial” In the previous lesson, “ Exodus 12–13, Part 1 ,” students studied how the Lord delivered the Israelites from Egypt. You could write the word Passover on the board. You might display the picture of Passover used in the previous lesson. Then invite students to summarize what they remember about the miracle of the first Passover (see Exodus 12:1–13 ). Consider organizing students into groups of three. Have each student study one of the following passages and share what they learn with the other members of the group. The Lord commanded His people to repeat the Passover meal “throughout [their] generations” ( Exodus 12:14 ). Read the following verses, looking for words and phrases that indicate what the Lord wanted them to remember and do: Exodus 12:14, 17 Exodus 12:25–27 Exodus 13:3, 8–10 What was preparing and partaking of the Passover meal designed to help the Israelites remember about the Lord? How do you think the Lord blessed the Israelites for obediently participating in the Feast of the Passover? Passover and the sacrament Display a picture of Jesus Christ at the Last Supper. Explain to students that the evening before His suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross, the Savior celebrated the Passover feast with His disciples. To help students visualize this moment, you could show the video “ The Last Supper ” from time code 0:00 to 1:18. The video is available on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . After students read the verses from Luke 22 , you could show from time code 2:13 to 3:15. 6:12 6:12 Read Luke 22:13–15, 19–20 , looking for the new ordinance the Savior instituted. How is the sacrament ordinance like Passover? How is it different? The following question can help students identify truths that relate to their lives. Questions like this can help students find personal relevance in the scriptures they study. Such questions also allow Heavenly Father to teach and inspire students personally. For additional training on helping students find relevance in the scriptures, see “ Learn the doctrine of Jesus Christ for yourself ” in Teacher Development Skills [2022], 29. What truths can we learn as we consider why Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have provided ordinances like Passover anciently and the sacrament today? Students may share a variety of truths. One truth they might identify could be that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ provide ordinances like Passover and the sacrament to help us remember Them . Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained one reason why Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ encourage us to remember Them: Our Heavenly Father wants us to recall His and His Beloved Son’s goodness … for the influence such remembrance has on us. By considering Their kindness, our perspective and understanding are enlarged. By reflecting on Their compassion, we become more humble, prayerful, and steadfast. (“ Consider the Goodness and Greatness of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2020, 41) How has remembering the goodness of God affected you? Remembering the Savior before, during, and after the sacrament The following activity can help students prepare to remember the Savior before, during, and after the sacrament. You could provide paper and art supplies. Invite students to create something like a poster, pamphlet, meme, or other reminder of the sacrament. Encourage students to be creative in their designs. Students could reserve space on the backs of their papers for the end of the lesson. At the end of the lesson, students will make plans to do something to better remember the Savior before, during, or after the sacrament. To help you remember the goodness of God as you prepare for, participate in, and remember the sacrament ordinance, do one or more of the following: List some of the symbols of the Passover feast that you have studied. Write down how these Passover symbols could help you remember the Savior before you take the sacrament. Read the sacrament prayers in Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79 . List the promises we make when we partake of the sacrament. Then list the Lord’s promises. Write a short paragraph of how thinking about these promises could help you remember the Savior during the sacrament. List a few passages of scripture or a statement from a Church leader that you might want to read and ponder during the sacrament. Choose passages or statements that could help you remember the Savior. Select a favorite sacrament hymn. List the title and two or three lines from the hymn. Choose lines that are meaningful to you and could help you remember the Savior after the sacrament. Students might share what they created with a partner, a group, or the class. You could encourage students to add ideas that other class members share. Make a plan to remember the Savior Quietly reflect on what you have learned and felt today. Invite the Holy Ghost to help you recognize something you could do to better remember Jesus Christ before, during, and after the sacrament. Invite students to use some space on the backs of their papers to answer the following question. What are some specific things you could do to better remember the Savior as you prepare for, participate in, and reflect on the sacrament? A few willing students could share what they feel impressed to do. Invite students to take their papers with them to sacrament meeting to help them remember what they have learned and felt. Consider sharing your witness of the power that can come into our lives as we better remember the Savior while preparing for and participating in the sacrament.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 45 ---\nWe might feel hopeless at times, similar to how the Israelites might have felt while trapped between the Red Sea and Pharaoh’s army. However, Moses’s counsel to them still applies to us today: “Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord” ( Exodus 14:13 ). This lesson can help students feel the desire to place their trust in the Lord for strength and deliverance. Student preparation: Invite students to study Exodus 14:13–14 and to consider aspects of their lives where these verses could help. Possible Learning Activities Surrounded by trials Help students reflect on challenges in their lives that can make them feel overwhelmed or trapped. One way to do this is to share the following statement from Brother Milton Camargo of the Sunday School General Presidency. You could write his father’s advice in the center of the board. Brother Milton Camargo, First Counselor in the Sunday School General Presidency, shared advice from his father: My father used to tell me, “Don’t focus so intensely on your problems that you can’t see the solution.” (“ Focus on Jesus Christ ,” Liahona , May 2023, 64) Ask students to share what they think Brother Camargo’s father was teaching. Then invite them to write around the statement on the board any problems, challenges, or trials that may be difficult for them to see solutions to. Students could answer the first of the following questions aloud. With the second question, it may be wise to invite them to quietly ponder their answers. Ponder times when you may have felt there was no solution to the problems you have faced. What are some ways a person might respond in such circumstances? How do you normally respond under such circumstances? As you study Exodus 14 today, seek inspiration from the Holy Ghost to help you increase your desire to trust in the Lord as you face or prepare to face challenges and trials. The Israelites’ predicament To help students understand the Israelites’ situation in Exodus 14 , display or help them locate map 2 in the Bible Maps, found in the Latter-day Saint edition of the King James Bible. As you share the following paragraph, invite students to locate Pi-hahiroth (#3) on the map. As the children of Israel left Egypt, the Lord commanded Moses to lead them to Pi-hahiroth ( Exodus 14:2 ). Shortly after letting the Israelites go, Pharaoh realized that “the wilderness had shut them in” ( Exodus 14:3 ), so he hardened his heart and pursued after them. President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained the following about the Israelites’ circumstances. The children of Israel [were in a] horrible predicament. … There were chariots behind them, sand dunes on every side, and a lot of water immediately ahead. … In this case it was literally a matter of life and death. (“ Cast Not Away Therefore Your Confidence ,” Ensign , Mar. 2000, 9) To help students visualize this account, you could show them the following image of the Red Sea. Invite them to imagine they were among the Israelites at this moment. How might you have responded under these circumstances? Consider inviting students to compare and contrast the Israelites’ response to their circumstances with Moses’s response. Noting similarities and differences between people, teachings, and events in the scriptures is an important scripture study skill. Making these comparisons can help students identify important gospel truths that they might not see otherwise. You might want to briefly explain the skill of comparing and contrasting. Invite students to practice it in the following study activity. In your study journal, create a small chart with two columns. Label one column Israelites and the other Moses . Read Exodus 14:10–14 , looking for what the Israelites said and what Moses said. Summarize what you find in the appropriate column. What did the Israelites focus on in these circumstances? What did Moses focus on? What do you notice by comparing what they said? What do you learn from this account that could help you with your challenges? Among other truths students may share, help them see the following: Focusing on Jesus Christ can increase our hope during challenges and trials. What problems do you think can happen if we only focus on our challenges and trials? Focusing on Christ Consider sharing the rest of Brother Camargo’s statement from the beginning of the lesson. Brother Camargo shared the following about the power of focusing on Jesus Christ: My father used to tell me, “Don’t focus so intensely on your problems that you can’t see the solution.” I testify that the Lord Jesus Christ is the solution to even our most difficult problems. (“ Focus on Jesus Christ ,” Liahona , May 2023, 64) Why do you think focusing on Jesus Christ is helpful when we feel surrounded or trapped by our challenges or trials? To demonstrate what Brother Camargo taught, invite students to first focus their mind on the challenges they wrote on the board. Have them focus on those challenges for 30 seconds. Then ask them to ponder how they feel. Next, place a picture of Jesus Christ at the front of the class. Invite students to solely focus their thoughts on His power and love for 30 seconds. Invite students to write their answers to the following question in their study journals. What difference might you notice when you focus on Jesus Christ and His power more than the challenges you are facing? Display the questions below, and separate students into pairs or small groups. Invite them to choose two or three of the challenges on the board and to discuss these questions. In what ways can Jesus Christ be a solution to the problems, challenges, or trials you chose? How can a person act with faith in Jesus Christ during that specific problem, challenge, or trial? Invite willing students to share what they learned or felt. The Lord’s mighty power Consider having students read the following verses individually or in partnerships. Students could also draw what they read in their study journals. If it is beneficial for your students, you could invite several students to briefly act out verses 19–22. For example, you could create a small barrier that can be removed or separated, allowing the students to walk through. Another option is to show the animated video “ The Passover ” from time code 1:28 to 2:32. This video is found on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 2:54 Read Exodus 14:15–31 , looking for how the Lord fought for and delivered the Israelites. What inspires you about this account? What did you find that helps you want to place your trust in the Lord? Personal strength and deliverance The next question may initially be difficult for students to answer. Hearing the experiences of others can help them think of their own. You might want to share an experience you or someone you know has had that could help answer the question. Or show a video such as the following that depicts the importance of focusing on the Savior during our trials: “ Finding Christ During Difficult Times ” (4:35) “ Feeling the Lord’s Love and Goodness in Trials ” (4:18) Both videos are available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 4:35 4:17 How has focusing on Jesus Christ during a challenge or trial helped you or someone you know? Help students see that sometimes we may not be delivered from our challenges in the ways we expect. However, focusing on Jesus Christ can help us find hope and strength no matter what we are facing. Consider ending by sharing your testimony of Jesus Christ and of the importance of focusing on Him in our trials. You may consider including the statement below with your testimony. Brother Camargo testified that the Savior can help us: The Lord Jesus Christ lives today. He can be an active, daily presence in our lives. He is the solution to our problems, but we must lift our eyes and raise our sights to see Him. He has said, “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not” [ Doctrine and Covenants 6:36 ]. (“ Focus on Jesus Christ ,” Liahona , May 2023, 67)\n\n\n--- Lesson 46 ---\nGod often uses physical experiences to teach essential spiritual lessons. For example, God used the Israelites’ needs for water and for help in battle to teach them and us. Through practice and the guidance of the Spirit, we can learn to identify and apply the spiritual truths in scripture accounts to our lives. This lesson can help students practice identifying truths from God in scripture accounts and connecting those truths to their lives. Student preparation: Invite students to reflect on the accounts they have studied from the Old Testament and the Pearl of Great Price so far this semester. Ask them to come to class prepared to share how they would complete the following sentence: “I like the account of because it teaches me that .” Possible Learning Activities Identifying gospel truths in the scriptures In this lesson, students will have the chance to find and share various gospel truths. It may be helpful to remind students that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are the source of all gospel truths. Explain that learning how to find and apply gospel truths can help us draw nearer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. To begin the lesson, consider asking students how they would fill in the blanks in the sentence below. If a visual reminder of some of the accounts you’ve studied would be helpful, you might display images like the ones below. Or invite students to look through images of the Old Testament in the Gospel Art Book [2009], which can be found in Gospel Library under “Videos and Images.” Complete the following sentence with a scripture account of your choice: “I like the account of because it teaches me that .” As volunteers share with the class, they could write the truths they identify on the board. The truths they share may be stated as doctrine, such as “We are children of God” (see Moses 1:1–7 ). Or they may be stated as principles that can be applied, such as “If we are willing to be led by God, He will increase our ability to accomplish His work” (see Moses 6:31–36 ). You might also ask students who share to explain why the truth they wrote is important in their lives. As the teacher, try not to give your own response to every student’s comment. It can be helpful to ask the class to share what they learned from another student’s comment. This can help students discover their own thoughts and feelings through the influence of the Holy Ghost. For additional training on this, see “ Help learners take responsibility for their learning ” in Teacher Development Skills [2022]. As students share, you might point out that there is an important difference between liking a scripture account and finding relevant truths from God in that account. Explain that as they prayerfully seek the Spirit’s guidance in their scripture study, Heavenly Father will help them find the truths that are the most relevant to them. After students are done sharing, invite them to reflect on their efforts to identify truths in their personal scripture study. You might use the following prompts. Record your answers to the following questions in your study journal. Is your personal scripture study helping you grow closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Why or why not? How often do you pause during your scripture study to identify truths that you feel Heavenly Father wants you to focus on? Do you seek to understand how scripture accounts apply to your life? As you study accounts from Exodus 15 and 17 today, pay attention to inspired thoughts and feelings from the Spirit. Look for impressions that could help you get more out of your personal scripture study. Identifying gospel truths from Exodus 15, 17 In this section of the lesson, students will have the chance to identify and find relevant truths from the account of the Lord caring for the Israelites in the wilderness. Consider dividing the class into partnerships. Assign similar numbers of partnerships to study each of the accounts in the handout. You might assign students with less experience studying the scriptures to work with students who have more experience. Be sure to give partnerships enough time to discuss and prepare. You could walk around and help students who might need a little extra direction. Open PDF After sufficient time to study, discuss, and prepare, give partnerships the opportunity to share what they learned. The following are ways students might share depending on available time: Each pair shares with a pair that studied a different account. They then rotate one more time to share with a partnership who studied the remaining account. Partnerships first get together and share with others who studied the same account. (This could give students additional insights about their own account.) Then students get together and share in groups of six, with each partnership having studied different accounts. Partnerships take turns presenting what they prepared to the entire class. Personalizing the lesson To conclude the lesson, consider using prompts like the following to help students personalize what they learned. Record your thoughts about the following in your study journal: What do you feel Heavenly Father would like you to remember from this lesson? Why? How could you use the skill of identifying truths from scripture accounts in your personal scripture study? How might using this skill affect your experience with the scriptures? You might invite volunteers to share part of what they wrote in their study journals. Also, consider looking for opportunities in upcoming lessons to invite students to share truths they are learning from their personal scripture study.\n\n\n--- Lesson 47 ---\nAfter the Lord delivered His people from Egypt, they encountered new challenges and opportunities for growth. The Israelites could no longer rely on the Egyptians to provide necessities like food and water. They needed to learn to rely on the Lord for their daily needs. This lesson can help students rely on the Lord daily. Student preparation: Invite students to look for evidence of the Lord’s power in their lives between now and the next class. Encourage them to take time in their personal or family prayers to thank Heavenly Father for His help. Possible Learning Activities The need for daily nourishment Consider beginning class by discussing things our bodies need every day. For example, you could display some bread. Invite a student who is hungry to come to the front of the class and eat some of the bread. As the student eats, ask him or her the following questions: When did you last eat? If you recently ate, why are you hungry now? Why do we have to eat regularly? Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles compared feeding our physical bodies to caring for our spirits: We all recognize the need for physical sustenance. Hunger and thirst remind us very strongly if we forget. But the spiritual need for sustenance is equally strong. (“ Daily Bread: Pattern ,” Gospel Library) Why do you think the need to feed our spirits is as important as caring for our bodies? Why can it be easy to overlook our spiritual needs? Take some time to ponder the following questions. Consider recording your thoughts in your study journal: Do you feel the same desire to care for your spirit every day as you do for your body? Why or why not? What do you feel Heavenly Father would have you do each day to care for your spirit? Seek inspiration to know what you can continue to do, or what you can change, to provide your spirit with the daily strength from the Lord that it needs. Relying on the Lord daily After crossing the Red Sea, the Israelites “believed the Lord, and his servant Moses” ( Exodus 14:31 ). They sang and danced to praise the Lord for delivering them (see Exodus 15:1–21 ). However, the Israelites’ praise of the Lord did not last long. While Moses led them toward Mount Sinai, they faced various problems, and their faith was tested. Read Exodus 16:2–4, 11–15 , looking for how the Lord provided for the Israelites’ needs. What did you find? Consider inviting students to mark the word “manna” in Exodus 16:15 and to cross-reference or link it to John 6:47–51 . Read John 6:31–35, 47–51 , looking for what Jesus taught about manna. In what ways is manna similar to Jesus Christ? How is what Jesus offers us infinitely better than manna? Encourage students to focus on Jesus Christ as they study about manna. One way to do this is to provide students with the handout titled “Bread from Heaven.” Students could complete the handout individually or in small groups. Alternatively, you could invite small groups of students to read Exodus 16:14–31, 35 and to create a quiz about manna. They could write 3–4 questions that could be answered by reading the verses. Groups could then exchange quizzes with another group. Open PDF Share the correct answers after students have finished: 1. True; 2. False; 3. False; 4. True; 5. True; 6. False; 7. True; 8. False. How might these details about manna apply to our need for spiritual nourishment? What can these details about manna teach you about receiving the spiritual nourishment from Jesus Christ? Students may have discovered many valuable truths. They could share why they feel the truths they identified are important. You could also ask other follow-up questions. The rest of this lesson will focus on the following truth: when we rely on the Lord daily, He will bless us with the spiritual nourishment we need . ( Note: Students will reflect on their desire to rely on the Lord in Lesson 55: “ Assess Your Learning 3 .” If you feel impressed to focus on a different truth for the remainder of this lesson, be sure to make corresponding adaptations when you teach Lesson 55.) To deepen students’ understanding of our daily need for Jesus Christ, you could share the following statement or watch “ Daily Bread: Pattern ” (2:51), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 2:52 Elder Christofferson spoke of our need for daily spiritual nourishment from the Lord: We ought not to think that we can go weeks and months without spiritual sustenance and not suffer and not have a deadening influence in our spiritual life. Acknowledging the reality of our need for a daily spiritual administration, or manna, helps us increase in our courage to do the right thing and to serve others more than we would have if we ignored God. (“ Daily Bread: Pattern ,” Gospel Library) Why is relying on the Lord each day better than occasional, powerful spiritual experiences? Daily bread Provide the following instructions. In addition to the suggested scripture passages, students could look for statements from Church leaders by searching words or phrases such as “daily” or “each day” in the Gospel Library. In your study journal, label a page “Daily Bread: Jesus Christ.” In the middle of the page, draw a loaf of bread. Study the following scriptures, looking for things we can do every day to rely on the Lord and receive spiritual nourishment. Write what you find around your drawing of bread. Deuteronomy 8:3 1 Nephi 17:3 2 Nephi 32:3 Alma 37:36–37 Invite students to discuss what they discovered by asking questions such as the following. You could encourage students to add ideas to their study journals as they learn from their classmates. Which of these actions have helped you invite the Bread of Life, Jesus Christ, into your life daily? How has He nourished or strengthened you as a result? In addition to what you found in the scriptures, what other things do you try to do each day to rely on the Lord? What would you say to someone who feels they don’t need to do these things? If time allows, consider singing a hymn with the class about our need for the Lord, such as “ I Need Thee Every Hour ” ( Hymns , no. 98). Students could share lines from the hymn that are meaningful to them. Look at the list that you wrote around the bread in your study journal. Circle one or two ideas you feel the Lord would have you start doing or do differently to better rely on Him each day. Then answer the following: When and where will you do this thing each day? What challenges will you need to overcome to make this habit a part of your daily routine? How will you overcome these challenges? How do you think doing this thing every day might affect your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ over time? Conclude by sharing your thoughts and feelings about our need to rely on the Lord each day. Look for opportunities in future lessons to follow up on students’ efforts. You could also periodically update your students on your daily efforts to rely on the Lord.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 48 ---\nHeavenly Father loves all His children and desires a covenant relationship with each of us. Learning how He felt about the Israelites can help us understand how He feels about us. After leading the children of Israel out of Egypt, the Lord brought them to Mount Sinai to make covenants with Him. This lesson can help students feel in their hearts God’s desire to have a covenant relationship with them. Student preparation: Invite students to reflect on what makes a relationship meaningful or important. They could think of someone whom they have a meaningful relationship with, and they could bring a picture of this person to share at the beginning of class. Possible Learning Activities Special relationships Consider displaying a picture of someone you have a meaningful relationship with, such as a family member or a mentor. Share why your relationship with this person is important to you. Invite students to think about someone meaningful in their lives. If students brought a picture to class, they could share it now. What makes your relationship with this person meaningful? Invite students to ponder the following questions prayerfully. Ask them to record their thoughts and feelings in their study journals. How meaningful to you is your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? What makes the connection that you have with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ different from other relationships you have? In what ways do you think your life might change as you continually strengthen your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Seek guidance from the Spirit to understand what you can do to strengthen your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. “A peculiar treasure unto me” After the children of Israel departed Egypt, the Lord led them to Mount Sinai (sometimes the scriptures refer to Mt. Sinai as Mt. Horeb; see Exodus 3:1 ), as He had promised (see Exodus 3:7–12 ; 19:1–4 ). For Moses and the children of Israel, Mount Sinai was like a temple: a place where they would make covenants with God. Read Exodus 19:3–6 , looking for words and phrases that teach about the kind of relationship Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ want with us. What did you find? President Russell M. Nelson explained what it means to be God’s “peculiar treasure” ( verse 5 ): In the Old Testament, the Hebrew term from which peculiar was translated is segullah , which means “valued property,” or “treasure.” … Thus, we see that the scriptural term peculiar signifies “valued treasure,” “made” or “selected by God.” For us to be identified by servants of the Lord as his peculiar people is a compliment of the highest order. (“ Children of the Covenant ,” Ensign , May 1995, 34) To help students identify a principle, you may want to point out the words if and then in verse 5 . What principles can you identify from these verses? Students may identify a variety of principles, including if we obey the Lord’s voice and keep our covenants with Him, we will become His holy people . President Russell M. Nelson taught about the covenant relationship we can have with God: Once you and I have made a covenant with God, our relationship with Him becomes much closer than before our covenant. Now we are bound together. Because of our covenant with God, He will never tire in His efforts to help us, and we will never exhaust His merciful patience with us. Each of us has a special place in God’s heart. He has high hopes for us. (Russell M. Nelson, “ The Everlasting Covenant ,” Liahona , Oct. 2022, 6) What stands out to you from this statement? Read the following scripture passages, looking for evidence that God wants a covenant relationship with you. You may want to link or cross-reference these verses with Exodus 19:5–6 . Matthew 11:28–30 Titus 2:11–14 1 Peter 1:15–16 Moroni 10:32–33 Invite students to share words and phrases from these verses that show that God wants a covenant relationship with us. Students may mention that the Savior invites us to come unto Him so He can help us and give us rest (see Matthew 11:28–30 ). They might mention that the Savior gave Himself to redeem and purify us as His peculiar people (see Titus 2:14 ) or that we can be holy because the Savior is holy (see 1 Peter 1:16 ). My relationship with God To prepare students to answer the following questions in their study journals, you could share ways you have felt that God wants a covenant relationship with you. Invite students to reflect on their own experiences as you share. You may also want to mention other evidence that God wants to have a covenant relationship with us. Examples might include feeling God’s love or receiving spiritual impressions that encourage us to do good and to become better. Reflect on any impressions you have received from the Spirit, and respond to one or more of the following questions in your study journal: What have you learned or felt that helps you want to make and keep covenants with God? How does knowing that God wants a close covenant relationship with you affect your desire to come closer to Him? How has God blessed you for striving to keep the covenants that you have made with Him? After enough time, invite willing students to share their thoughts and feelings with the class. Consider sharing ways God has blessed you for making and keeping covenants with Him. The Israelites prepare to make a covenant The following summary can help students understand what Israel did to prepare to make a covenant with God. You might want to mention that after this, the Lord revealed the Ten Commandments, which students will study in the next two lessons. As you conclude the lesson, you might also share your thoughts and feelings about how God wants to make covenants with us. The Israelites agreed to make a covenant with God to become His holy people. The Lord then indicated He would come and speak to the people (see Exodus 19:7–9 ). The Lord commanded Moses to sanctify the people, or make them holy, and for the people to cleanse their garments in preparation for when the Lord would “come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai” ( Exodus 19:11 ). The people prepared themselves and gathered to Mount Sinai “to meet with God” ( Exodus 19:17 ). There, they saw evidence of the Lord’s presence on the mountain. The Lord called Moses up the mountain to speak with Him and to reveal His will for the people (see Exodus 19:18–25 ).\n\n\n--- Lesson 49 ---\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ love all of us and want us to choose Them first in our lives. After delivering the Israelites from Egypt, the Lord led them to Mount Sinai to make a covenant with Him. There He revealed the Ten Commandments to help them love Him more than anything else. This lesson can help students love and honor God above everything else. Student preparation: Invite students to list some of God’s commandments. Invite them to discuss with a family member or friend how the commandments they listed help them to show their love for God and to put Him first in their lives. Possible Learning Activities The greatest commandment Note: This lesson focuses on the first four commandments. Lesson 50: “ Exodus 20:12–17 ” will focus on the last six. You may want to begin class by asking students to think about what commandment, of all of God’s commandments they think is the most important. Then share the following summary. During His mortal ministry, the Savior was asked which of the commandments was the greatest, or most important (see Matthew 22:36 ). Read Matthew 22:37–39 (see also Leviticus 19:18 ; Deuteronomy 6:5 ), looking for the Savior’s response. Why do you think these are the two greatest commandments? As you study the Ten Commandments in this lesson and other lessons, look for how these commandments help us love God and our neighbors. During this lesson, you will study some of the Ten Commandments that help us love and honor God. Read Exodus 20:1–11 , looking for the first four commandments the Lord gave the Israelites. Exodus 20:3–17 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. What similarities do you see between these commandments and the first great commandment from Matthew 22:37–38 ? You may want to summarize on the board the truths that students share. They might look something like God commands us to love Him and put Him first in our lives . You could invite students to cross-reference or link Exodus 20:3–17 with Matthew 22:36–39 . What do you think it means to put God first in our lives? Help students think about how they are currently applying this truth in their lives. You could invite them to complete the following self-assessment. Ponder your responses to the following questions. You might want to record some of your thoughts in your study journal. Is my love for God the most important influence in my life? What might be holding me back from loving God and putting Him first in my life? Commandments that help us love God and put Him first The accompanying handout is designed to help students understand how the commandments in Exodus 20:3–11 can help us love God and put Him first in our lives. You could use the handout in a variety of ways. Open PDF Sharing can help students be more aware of what they are learning. Provide students with an opportunity to share what they learned from the handout. Students could share in small groups or with the class. As appropriate, consider responding to the following question with your own experience after willing students have responded. What blessings have you, or someone you know, experienced by putting God first? Putting God first The following activity can help students create a plan to love God and put Him first in their lives. Remind students that the number 1 refers to placing God first in our lives. In your study journal, or on a separate piece of paper, draw a large number 1. Make it large enough to write inside, or leave room to write next to it. Seek guidance from Heavenly Father through the Holy Ghost to decide what you can do to put God first in your life. Inside or next to the number 1 write what you will do. Write your answers to the following questions underneath: How might doing this help you love God and put Him first in your life? How might the Lord bless you for doing this? What challenges might you face as you do this? What can you do to overcome these challenges? Encourage students to act on the spiritual impressions they have had. Students will have an opportunity to follow up on their progress in Lesson 67: “ Assess Your Learning 4 .” Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Exodus 20:3–17 is “The Ten Commandments.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 50 ---\nWhen the children of Israel were camped at Mount Sinai, the Lord revealed the Ten Commandments. By keeping the Ten Commandments, we show our love for God and others. As we strive to love others as Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ do, our love for Them also increases. This lesson can help students understand ways to keep commandments that will help them love God and their neighbor. Student preparation: Invite students to test their knowledge of the Ten Commandments. They could work on listing them in order or reciting them from memory. Possible Learning Activities Survey about commandments Invite students to find and read the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:3–17 or on page 39 in For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices (2022). They can respond to the following questions, or they can rank the Ten Commandments from 1 (most obeyed) to 10 (most broken) based on what this survey might find. Which of the Ten Commandments do you feel people obey most often? Why? Which of the Ten Commandments do you feel people break most often? Why? How do you think our feelings for God are reflected in how we treat His commandments? The Ten Commandments help us love God and our neighbor Students might have studied the Ten Commandments in Lesson 49: “ Exodus 20:1–11 ”. You might want to have students read or review Matthew 22:36–40 , looking for the two great commandments that Jesus taught. Students could review how the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:3–17 relate to these two great commandments. Help students notice how the last six commandments focus on loving our neighbor. Read Exodus 20:12–17 , the last six of the Ten Commandments. Look for how these verses teach that by living the Ten Commandments, we show our love for God and our neighbor . As you study, be open to impressions from the Holy Ghost. Ponder what you can do to love God and your neighbor by keeping the Ten Commandments. Commandments to love our neighbor Consider using the handout “Commandments That Help Us Love Our Neighbor” to help students take responsibility for their learning. Invite them to study one of the commandments and to prepare to share what they learn about it. Students could choose which commandment to study, or you could assign each student a commandment. They could study individually, in partnerships, or in small groups. Divide the handout among students according to the commandment they are studying. Give students a set amount of time to study. Leave enough time for the sharing activity later in the lesson. Open PDF Student sharing Thank students for their hard work, and praise them for their efforts. Think of a way for them to share what they learned. For example, you could arrange the seats so students are sitting across from one another in rows. Provide a set amount of time for them to share what they studied with the person sitting across from them. After both students share, invite students in one of the rows to move one seat over. Students will now be with a different partner. Repeat as many times as desired. Afterward, students could discuss the following questions as a class or with their current partner. Pick a specific commandment you studied, and answer the following questions: How can your love for God and your neighbor help you keep this commandment? What blessings have you experienced from living this commandment? Consider sharing your thoughts on how obedience to the Lord’s commandments can help us love God and others more. You might encourage students to continue striving to obey the Ten Commandments.\n\n\n--- Lesson 51 ---\nHow has the Savior’s justice, mercy, and long-suffering worked together to bless your life? When Moses returned from the presence of the Lord, he found that the Israelites had broken the covenants they had made and were worshipping a golden calf. The Israelites suffered the consequences of this sin, but the Lord demonstrates His justice, mercy, and long-suffering toward those who repent and return to Him. This lesson can help students understand that the Lord is just, merciful, and long-suffering. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder how they have seen the Lord’s justice, love, and long-suffering (patience) in their lives. You could invite them to visit with a family member or friend about how the Lord’s justice and mercy work together to bless all of His children. Possible Learning Activities The Lord is just, merciful, and long-suffering Consider displaying a picture of the Savior. Discuss the following question. What word would you use to describe the Savior’s character? Invite students to write their word on the board. Consider selecting a couple of examples and inviting the students who wrote the words to describe why they selected that attribute of the Savior. To help the children of Israel understand Him, the Lord revealed some essential elements of His character. Read Exodus 34:6–7 , looking for attributes of the Savior. What did you discover? Among the attributes students might identify, emphasize the truth that the Lord is just, merciful, and long-suffering . You might help students understand that “longsuffering” ( verse 6 ) describes the Lord’s patience with us. You could share with students that they will study how the children of Israel experienced the Lord’s justice, mercy, and long-suffering. They will also study why it is important for us to understand these truths about the Lord. The Israelites are the Lord’s covenant people The following scenario is used throughout the lesson to help students understand how the Israelites’ story could be relevant to youth today. The scenario uses the name “Kylie,” but you could invite students to select a name and to add or change the details of the story. Kylie, a young woman at your school, has been learning about the Savior’s gospel and has decided to make the changes necessary to be baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She desires to make a covenant with God to keep His commandments. Help students recall that after their deliverance from Egypt, the Lord brought the children of Israel to Mount Sinai to make a covenant with Him. Read Exodus 24:3–8 , looking for how the Israelites might have felt similarly to Kylie. What stands out to you? It might be helpful to explain to students that the sprinkling of blood on the altar and on the people (see Exodus 24:6, 8 ) was a symbolic, physical representation that the Israelites were willing to be the Lord’s covenant people. The Lord desired to bless the children of Israel with the ordinances of the Melchizedek Priesthood (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:19–23 ). Moses returned to Mount Sinai to receive the Lord’s instructions for these ordinances and plans for the tabernacle. Breaking our covenants and the consequences Read Exodus 32:1–8 , looking for what the Israelites did while Moses was on the mountain receiving direction from God. What did you discover? Why do you think building and worshipping the golden calf was such a serious sin? (See Exodus 20:2–7 .) Make sure students understand that the Israelites broke the covenant they had just made with the Lord. You could share another portion of the scenario that parallels what happened with the children of Israel and is more relevant to youth. Students could provide examples of what Kylie might have done to break the covenant she made at baptism to obey God’s commandments. After her baptism, Kylie began spending time with her old friends, and it led to old habits. At first, the mistakes she made seem to be small. However, before long, she had returned to old, familiar ways. She broke the covenant she made at baptism. What might have influenced Kylie’s decision? The Lord’s law of justice Read Exodus 32:15–20 , looking for consequences Israel suffered because of their sin. What did you find? Help students understand that although we can use our agency to sin, the Lord is just. Therefore, we cannot escape the consequences of our sins. It might be helpful to explain that Moses broke the tablets that contained instructions for Melchizedek Priesthood ordinances (see Exodus 32:15–19 ; Joseph Smith Translation, Exodus 34:1–2 [in the Bible appendix]). Because of their decisions, the children of Israel were not worthy to receive these blessings from the Lord. Moses returned to the presence of the Lord. The Lord instructed Moses to institute the ordinances of the Aaronic Priesthood instead (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:24–26 ). You could also mention that Moses placed the tabernacle outside the camp (see Exodus 33:7 ), symbolizing Israel losing the presence of the Lord. What are some of the spiritual and temporal consequences Kylie might face for breaking her baptismal covenant? How do consequences demonstrate the Lord’s justice, mercy, and long-suffering? You might want to point out that, like the Israelites, Kylie might miss out on blessings that come from priesthood ordinances. She could also lose the constant companionship of the Lord’s Spirit. The Lord’s law of mercy Help students understand that the Lord reassured Israel that they were still His people (see Exodus 33:12–19 ). Review Exodus 34:6–7 , and think about why it might have been important for the Lord to remind the children of Israel that He is just, merciful, and long-suffering. How did the Lord demonstrate His mercy and long-suffering with the children of Israel? How might Kylie see the Lord’s mercy and long-suffering in her life? Elder Quentin L. Cook of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained how the Savior’s mercy satisfies the law of justice: 13:53 Without the Savior’s Atonement, the eternal principle of justice would require punishment. Because of the Savior’s Atonement, mercy can prevail for those who have repented, and it can allow them to return to the presence of God. We would do well to ponder this wonderful doctrine. None can return to God by his or her own good works alone; we all need the benefit of the Savior’s sacrifice. All have sinned, and it is only through the Atonement of Jesus Christ that we can obtain mercy and live with God. (“ Be True to God and His Work ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 119) What parts of this statement might you share with Kylie? Asking questions that help students understand how the Lord demonstrates His love, power, and mercy in their lives can increase their connection to Him. One way to do this is to invite students to answer the following question. For additional training, see “ Help learners recognize the Lord’s love, power, and mercy in their lives ” in Teacher Development Skills. What evidence have you seen of the Savior’s justice, mercy, and long-suffering in your life or in the life of someone you know? Demonstrate understanding This activity can help students summarize what they have learned today. You could invite them to finish Kylie’s story. Consider displaying the following prompts for students to complete. Because of her experiences, Kylie may have learned that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ . Because of what she learned about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, Kylie decides to . Consider inviting a few willing students to share how they might finish Kylie’s story with the class. After students have had a chance to share their responses, you could share how you have seen the Lord’s justice, mercy, and long-suffering in your life.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 52 ---\nIn obedience to the Lord’s command, the Israelites built a tabernacle, or temple, in the wilderness. This tabernacle was a portable sanctuary where the Lord could dwell among His people as they traveled. This lesson can help students feel an increased desire to worship the Lord in His temple. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to use the Gospel Library or temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org to find pictures of temples or videos related to the temple. Ask students to think about how they feel about the Lord’s temple. Invite them to consider how modern-day temples help them remember Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Possible Learning Activities What is the purpose of temples? Consider beginning the lesson by sharing the following scenario. You could then display the questions after the scenario and invite students to discuss them with a partner. Imagine that a temple will soon be dedicated in your area. You invite a friend to attend the temple open house with you. Your friend accepts your invitation but mentions that she does not know anything about temples. What would you want your friend to understand about temples and their purpose? How might you respond if your friend asked you why temples are important to you? After students have discussed their responses with their partners, invite them to think about their answers to the following question. Using a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high), how would you rate your desire to consistently worship the Lord in the temple? Consider inviting the students to think about why they responded the way they did to the previous question. As you study today, pay attention to what the Holy Ghost can teach you about temples and how they connect us to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Seek inspiration to help you feel an increased desire to worship the Lord in His temples. The Lord commands the Israelites to build a tabernacle While speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, the Lord asked that the Israelites offer their gold, silver, and other valuable materials to build a sanctuary, or tabernacle, for Him. In our time, we have also been asked to build temples to serve as a sanctuary or a place of holiness. Read Exodus 25:8 , looking for why the Lord wanted the Israelites to build a sanctuary. What did you find? What does the Lord’s reason for this commandment teach you about Him and the way He feels about us? Symbolism of the tabernacle Remind students that there are many symbols in the scriptures that can teach us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Learning from symbols is a study skill that can help them learn more from the scriptures. For additional training on using symbolism, see “ Look for symbols that testify of Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills (2022), 9. The objects and ordinances in the tabernacle were symbolic. They were meant to teach Israel about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and how to journey through life back to Them. To help students learn about the symbols of the tabernacle, consider distributing the handout titled “ The Old Testament Tabernacle .” You could also place tape or string on the floor of the classroom to re-create the diagram from the handout. Consider inviting students to study the objects in the tabernacle in small groups. Each group could be assigned different objects to study. Groups could then share their findings with the class. Remind students to seek guidance from the Spirit as they consider what the objects teach them about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. You can provide help as needed, but in general, it may be best to allow students to discover and make connections on their own as they learn for themselves through the Holy Ghost. 7:19 Instead of the handout, you could have students study the article “ Journey through the Ancient Tabernacle ” ( Ensign , Mar. 2018, 52–53) or watch the video “ The Tabernacle ” (7:18), available on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Open PDF After students have had enough time to study, invite them to share what they learned. You could ask questions like the following as part of this discussion. What symbols seemed especially meaningful or interesting to you? What did the symbols from the tabernacle teach you about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Modern-day temples Consider displaying an image of a modern-day temple . Explain that temples today include Melchizedek Priesthood ordinances that God withheld from the ancient Israelites because of their rebellion. Despite this difference, there are many similarities that our temples share with the ancient tabernacle. What similarities do you see between our temples and the ancient tabernacle? What truths do you learn from these similarities? Encourage students to share a variety of answers to the previous question. You could list on the board the truths that students identify. Using their own words, students may identify truths such as the following: The Lord commands us to build temples so He can dwell among us. The ordinances and symbols of the temple teach about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The temple helps us prepare to return to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Explain that, like the ancient tabernacle, modern-day temples contain symbols that teach us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. What are ways that modern-day temples help you remember Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? As part of your discussion of the previous question, consider showing pictures of specific rooms inside modern-day temples. For example, after pointing out a picture of a baptistry in the temple, you could ask the students what the ordinance of baptisms for the dead can teach us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. You might want to use the images above or the images included in the article “ Inside Temples ,” available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . You could also watch the video “ Welcome to the Washington D.C. Temple ” (11:46), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . This video is another resource to help students see how modern-day temples teach us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. If time is limited, consider watching one of the following portions: time code 0:00 to 3:49, time code 4:37 to 7:44, or time code 8:16 to 9:04. 11:45 How can knowing that temples teach us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ affect our desire to worship there? When have you felt closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ because of the temple or by participating in temple and family history work? Record your impressions To help students reflect on what they have learned and felt from the Holy Ghost today, consider inviting them to answer the following question in their study journals. What have you learned or felt today from the Holy Ghost that has influenced your desire to worship the Lord in the temple? You could invite a few willing students to share what they wrote. Let students know they will have an opportunity to reflect on their desire to worship the Lord in the temple in Lesson 80: “ Assess Your Learning 5 ”. Testify of the truths you have discussed today.\n\n\n--- Lesson 53 ---\nWhile the practice of sacrificing animals may seem strange today, these sacrifices helped ancient Israel know and appreciate what the Savior had covenanted to do for them. Learning about these ancient sacrifices can likewise help us know and appreciate what the Savior did for us. This lesson can help students feel gratitude for Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder advice they would give someone who is struggling to understand what Jesus Christ has done for them. You could also invite students to ask a family member or friend what advice they would give. Possible Learning Activities What has He done for me? To prepare students to talk about Jesus Christ, consider sharing the following experience. President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency shared the following interaction he had with a member of the Church: 12:44 In a Saturday evening meeting at a stake conference many years ago, I met a woman who said her friends had asked her to come back to church after many years of inactivity, but she could not think of any reason why she should. To encourage her, I said, “When you consider all of the things the Savior has done for you, you have many reasons to come back to worship and serve Him.” I was astonished when she replied, “What’s He done for me?” (“ What Has Our Savior Done for Us? ,” Liahona , May 2021, 75) Ponder what you would say to the woman if she asked you this question. How might our lives be affected if we fail to recognize or remember what the Savior has done for us? To help students personalize today’s lesson, consider displaying the following questions. Give students time to record their answers in their study journals. What has the Savior done for you? How do you feel about Jesus Christ for what He has done for you? As you study Leviticus today, seek guidance from the Holy Ghost about how you can deepen your gratitude for what the Lord has done for you. Finding Christ in sacrifices To prepare students to study Leviticus, consider displaying the images from the beginning of the lesson. Invite the students to discuss what they know about the ancient ordinance of animal sacrifice. For example, you could ask them when God first commanded His children to perform animal sacrifices and why He gave that commandment. If needed, you could refer students to Moses 5:6–7 . Then ask the following question. What did these sacrifices represent? Help students understand that from the time of Adam and Eve, God commanded His people to perform animal sacrifice to help them look forward to the Savior and His atoning sacrifice. This practice ended with the death of Jesus Christ, who was the “great and last sacrifice” ( Alma 34:10 ). The book of Leviticus contains the Lord’s directions for animal and other types of sacrifices that He required of His people. Leviticus is like a handbook that provides instructions for ancient Israel’s ordinances, rituals, and sacred responsibilities. Give students an opportunity to study some of the sacrifices described in Leviticus. One way to do this is to distribute the handout titled “ Ancient Sacrifice: A Symbol of Jesus Christ .” You could distribute the two activities from the handout separately, or you could distribute it as one handout. Consider organizing students into pairs. You could assign each pair to complete one of the activities. The students could then teach what they learned to another pair that completed a different activity. Or you could invite one partner in each pair to complete Study Activity 1 and the other partner to complete Study Activity 2. After students individually complete their activities, they could teach one another. Open PDF After students have completed their study, invite them to share some of their responses to the handout questions. You could use the following question to help students summarize what they learned. How would you summarize in a simple statement what you learned today about the Savior and His atoning sacrifice? Students may share a variety of truths, such as: Jesus Christ willingly offered Himself as a sacrifice for us. We can be forgiven of our sins because of Jesus Christ. Through His atoning sacrifice, Jesus Christ paid for our sins by taking them upon Himself. To deepen students’ gratitude for these truths, consider using the following statement and questions. You may have used this statement in Lesson 27: “ Genesis 22 .” President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency explained why Jesus Christ performed the Atonement: Jesus Christ did all of this because He loves all of the children of God. Love is the motivation for it all, and it was so from the very beginning. … I … pray that we all will remember what our Savior has done for each of us. (“ What Has Our Savior Done for Us? ,” Liahona , May 2021, 77) How does it help you to know that Jesus Christ allowed Himself to be sacrificed because of His love for you? What are some ways we can remember the Lord and His sacrifice? Help students understand that one way we remember the Savior’s sacrifice is by partaking of the sacrament weekly. To help students see the connection between ancient sacrifice and the sacrament, consider showing the video “ Always Remember Him ” (5:27), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . You could then ask the following questions. 5:27 How is the sacrament similar to the ancient sacrifices? How do you strive to remember the Savior in your daily life? What Jesus did for me Give students time to reflect on their feelings toward Jesus Christ. To prepare them to do this, you could invite the class to sing “ I Stand All Amazed ” ( Hymns , no. 193). Students could identify phrases from the hymn that reflect their feelings toward the Savior. Alternatively, you could invite students to choose a different hymn or a scripture about the Savior and His Atonement. They could share phrases that reflect their feelings toward Him. Then, invite students to respond to the following question in their journals. How do you feel about the Savior and what He has done for you? Willing students could express their thoughts and feelings about the Savior. Consider sharing your own feelings and testimony about Him.\n\n\n--- Lesson 54 ---\nAncient Israel performed rituals that symbolized Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Among these rituals was the sacrifice of burnt offerings. These offerings also demonstrated Israel’s continual commitment to sacrifice anything the Lord asked of them. This lesson can help students recognize sacrifices they can make to become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to do something that they feel would be a good sacrifice for the Lord. Some examples might include paying tithing or fast offerings, sacrificing time to help someone in need, or sacrificing a few extra minutes of sleep to study the scriptures. Invite students to reflect on how this sacrifice affects their relationship with the Lord. Possible Learning Activities Willingness to sacrifice Consider beginning class by helping students see the value of being willing to make sacrifices for the Lord. You could do this by writing the following statement on the board. Invite students to discuss the accompanying questions. The key to making our day successful is … How would you finish this statement? Why do you feel your answer could help someone have a successful day? Elder Taylor G. Godoy of the Seventy shared the following about a successful day: The key to making our day successful is to be willing to sacrifice. (“ One More Day ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 34) Why do you think being willing to sacrifice can make our day successful? Consider writing students’ responses to the following question on the board. You could reference these answers at various points throughout the lesson. What are some sacrifices the Lord asks of us that you feel could lead to a successful day, week, or life? Consider inviting students to reflect on their willingness to make sacrifices for the Lord. One way you could do this is to show students a pie chart. Provide the following instructions. Create a pie chart in your study journal. Fill in a percentage (0 percent to 100 percent) that you feel reflects your willingness over the past week to sacrifice for the Lord. Then ponder the following questions: If you feel your percentage is high, why have you been willing to sacrifice for the Lord? If you feel your percentage is low, what may have kept you from being more willing to sacrifice? Consider offering a silent prayer. Ask Heavenly Father to help you understand what He would have you know and do regarding your personal sacrifices. During this lesson, pay attention to thoughts and feelings that might come to you through the Holy Ghost. Burnt offerings In Leviticus 1 , the Lord instructs the Israelites to make burnt offerings. Priests made these offerings daily. The offerings were symbolic of the Savior’s Atonement. These offerings were also a sign of Israel’s continual commitment to the Lord. Read Leviticus 1:3, 8–9 , looking for words and phrases that could relate to sacrifices we might make for the Lord today. What did you find? If students need help, you could point out some of the following: “He shall offer it of his own voluntary will” ( verse 3 ). “Head,” “fat,” “inwards,” and “legs” ( verses 8–9 ). These different parts of the animal could be symbolic of offering the Lord anything He asks of us, including our hearts, minds, and bodies. “Burn all on the altar” ( verse 9 ). Burning the whole animal on the altar represented total commitment to the Lord. “Sweet savour unto the Lord” ( verse 9 ). This can mean that our sacrifices are sweet and pleasing to Heavenly Father and the Savior. Jesus Christ is the perfect example of offering sacrifice. How can our willingness to sacrifice help us become more like the Savior? One lesson we can learn by understanding burnt offerings is that we can become more like our Savior as we are willing to sacrifice anything Heavenly Father asks of us . Living the law of sacrifice in our time After the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ was completed, He adjusted the type of sacrifice He asked His people to make (see 3 Nephi 9:19–20 ). Though we currently do not sacrifice animals, the Lord still asks His people to make sacrifices. These sacrifices include more than giving up our temporal possessions. Display the following instructions, scripture passages, and questions. You might invite students to complete this on their own. Study two or more of the following passages, looking for insights that can help you answer the questions below. Romans 12:1–2 Omni 1:26 3 Nephi 9:19–20 Doctrine and Covenants 4:2 How could you use these passages to help someone understand what the Lord wants us to sacrifice in our time? How could sacrificing in these ways help us become more like the Savior? Why do you think it can be difficult for some people to be willing to sacrifice what the Lord asks of them? Invite volunteers to share what they learned and how they would answer the two questions above. You might also discuss how these verses could apply to the sacrifices they listed on the board earlier in the lesson. This discussion could lead into the next question. Blessings of sacrifice Consider putting students into small groups. Invite them to use their answers to the previous question to create a scenario where someone might hesitate to sacrifice what the Lord asks of them. Following is one simple example. Invite students to discuss the accompanying question in their groups. To help with this discussion, students could study “ Sacrifice ” in the Guide to the Scriptures. Imagine you have a friend who feels they don’t have enough time to make some of the sacrifices the Lord asks of them. What could you share that might help resolve some of your friend’s concerns? Invite a few groups to share some of their insights. As they share, consider asking follow-up questions like “What would you want your friend to know about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that could help them be more willing to make sacrifices for Them?” or “What personal experiences could you share that have taught you the value of making sacrifices for the Lord?” To deepen understanding about sacrifice, you could display the following statement. Elder Ulisses Soares of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared some of the blessings the Lord gives as we make sacrifices for Him: 14:48 Our determination to cast off all that is contrary to God’s will and to sacrifice all we are asked to give and to strive to follow His teachings will help us to endure in the path of Jesus Christ’s gospel—even in the face of tribulation, the weakness of our souls, or the social pressure and worldly philosophies that oppose His teachings. (“ Take Up Our Cross ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 114) What have you learned about the Lord and His reasons for asking us to sacrifice? Personal sacrifice Invite students to reflect on impressions they have received. Consider displaying the following instructions. If helpful, students could refer to the list of sacrifices on the board as they complete this activity. Complete one of the following in your study journal: One sacrifice I am already making for Heavenly Father is … Something I learned today that will help me continue or improve on this sacrifice is … One thing I will start or stop doing to show my willingness to sacrifice for the Lord is … Something I learned today that will help me make this change is … You could invite students to share what they wrote along with their testimony of what they have learned or felt.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 56 ---\nSometimes it can be difficult to move forward with faith instead of fear. The children of Israel faced that challenge. After they journeyed in the wilderness, the Lord led the Israelites to the border of the promised land. The Lord instructed Moses to send 12 men into the land and have them bring back a report of the land and its inhabitants. Most of the 12 were afraid about the prospect of conquering the promised land, but Caleb and Joshua had faith that the Lord would help them. This lesson can help students view their challenges with greater faith in Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to think about obstacles or challenges they are currently facing. They could ponder how they are facing them with fear or with faith in the Lord. Possible Learning Activities Viewing challenges with faith Consider writing two headings on opposite sides of the board: Faith and Fear . Display the following experiences, or other relevant examples, one at a time. Invite students to ponder if they view each example with faith in Jesus Christ or with fear. A big test or school project Repentance The future Sharing the gospel How can we tell if we are viewing a situation with faith in Jesus Christ or with fear? What difference does it make if we view a situation with faith or fear? Why can it sometimes be difficult to see situations like these with faith in Jesus Christ? Continue to ponder these questions as you study today. Invite the Holy Ghost into your learning as you think about how to view your challenges with greater faith in Jesus Christ. The spies’ report of Canaan After the children of Israel traveled in the wilderness, the Lord brought them to the border of the promised land. It was the land of Canaan. The Lord told them they would need to conquer the land. The Lord instructed Moses to select one member from each of the twelve tribes. These men were commanded to inspect the land and bring back a report of what they found. After 40 days of investigating the land, the 12 men returned with their reports, along with fruit from the land (see Numbers 13:1–25 ). Consider dividing the class into thirds. Invite each group to read one of the following accounts. Ask students to imagine that they represent the people they read about. They can prepare answers to the questions that follow. Each group could then share their answers, or you could have a student or two come to the front and use the questions to interview each group. 1. Numbers 13:26–29, 31–33 : The 10 spies’ report of the land and the people How would you describe the land of Canaan and the people you saw? What feelings did you have when you saw the people? Why? 2. Numbers 14:1–4 : The Israelites’ response to the 10 spies’ report What feelings did you have when you listened to the 10 spies’ report? Why? What did you suggest the people do rather than follow Moses into the promised land? Why? 3. Numbers 13:30 ; 14:6–9 : Joshua and Caleb’s report of the land and the people How would you describe the land of Canaan and the people you saw? The other spies are convinced that Israel cannot overcome the people in Canaan. Why are you so sure that Israel can? After each group has answered their questions, thank them for their participation. Review Numbers 13:30 ; 14:8–9 , looking for words and phrases that show Caleb and Joshua’s faith in the Lord. What lessons do you learn from Caleb and Joshua? Among various answers students might give, help them identify the truth that trusting in the Lord can help us see our challenges with faith rather than fear . What do you think it means to act with faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ when we face challenges? Faith versus fear Elder Kevin R. Duncan of the Seventy explained something we can learn from the experience of the children of Israel in Numbers 13–14 : Just like the children of Israel, we face formidable obstacles. … It isn’t wrong for us to recognize those obstacles. But it is important that we face them with faith. … … Each challenge and each obstacle we face is an opportunity to choose, as did Joshua and Caleb, to rely on the Lord. “Rebel not … , neither fear” ( Numbers 14:9 ) was good counsel for the children of Israel, and it is still good counsel for each of us today. (“ Rebel Not, Neither Fear ,” Liahona , Apr. 2022, 47) What experiences had the children of Israel previously had with the Lord? How could remembering these experiences have increased their faith in Him? Why do you think some people forget what they know about the Lord when facing a challenge? Despite the many miracles the Lord had provided and the testimony of Caleb and Joshua, the Israelites continued to murmur. As a result, the Lord declared that because of their murmuring and doubt, the great majority of the adult Israelites would not be allowed to enter the promised land (see Numbers 14:26–39 ). Read Numbers 14:24, 30 , looking for how the Lord blessed Caleb and Joshua because they placed their faith in Him. To help students face their challenges with faith, consider displaying the following chart on the board. Invite them to copy the chart into their study journals. Challenge: Fear-Based Statement Faith-Based Statement Fear-Based Statement Faith-Based Statement Invite students to share some modern-day challenges they may face and ways they could respond with fear or faith. You might provide an example such as: Challenge: Speaking in public settings Fear-based statement: “I can’t speak in front of others because I always nervously mix up my words.” Faith-based statement: “Public speaking is hard for me, but I believe the Lord can give me courage and strength to do it.” Students could use the situations from the beginning of the lesson. For the following activity, consider providing pieces of paper for the students. Ponder a challenge you face, or might face, in your life. Write the challenge in your chart along with a fear-based statement you might think or believe about that challenge. Reflect on what the Holy Ghost has taught you about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from the scriptures, the words of the prophets, and your own spiritual experiences. Think about how this knowledge can help you face challenges with faith in the Lord. Then write a faith-based statement in your journal. You might also want to write the faith-based statement on a piece of paper that you can take home and set it somewhere you will see often. Or take a picture of the statement on your phone. You could even set the picture as your wallpaper on your phone. Consider inviting a few willing students to share their thoughts and feelings about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. They can share how the Lord helps them face challenges with faith. Testify that the Lord will bless us as we faithfully face our challenges.\n\n\n--- Lesson 57 ---\nAs the children of Israel continued through the wilderness, they complained against the Lord. In response, He sent venomous serpents among them. He then instructed Moses to set a brass serpent upon a pole as a symbol of the Savior and promised that those who looked upon it would be healed. This lesson can help students look to Jesus Christ in faith. Student preparation: Invite students to read Numbers 21:7–9 and Alma 33:18–21 , looking for what we can learn from this account in the Old Testament. Encourage them to be prepared to share what they learned in class. Possible Learning Activities A snake bite Consider beginning class by showing a picture of a snake. What do you think it would be like to be bitten by a venomous snake? Help students understand that being bitten by a venomous snake can cause swelling, blistering, severe pain, and illness. In extreme cases, it can even be deadly. What are some of the different ways people may react after being bitten? Some possible answers are: panic, seek revenge on the snake and kill it, wait to see how their body reacts to the bite, or immediately get help. Next to the snake, write sin . Invite students to compare how sin and its consequences might be like a snake bite. What are some of the different ways people may react after sinning? Some possible answers are rationalizing their actions, looking to numb their feelings, hiding their actions because of shame or embarrassment, waiting to see what further consequences they face, or looking to the Lord for help. Take a moment to ponder how you react. Do you look to the Lord for help? Why or why not? As you study this lesson, seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to help you look to the Savior for help in your life. You can also look for help with any questions or concerns you have about looking to the Savior. The fiery serpents As they had done many times before, the children of Israel complained against the Lord as they traveled through the wilderness. Read the following verses and answer their accompanying questions. It may be useful to know that fiery means “poisonous” (see footnote 6a ). Consider displaying or writing the following verses and questions on the board. You could invite students to study them together in small groups, or invite students to study the verses on their own, then share their answers with a partner or small group to confirm their answers. If useful, explain that because the children of Israel were not allowed to travel through the land of Edom, but had to travel around it (see Numbers 21:4 ), which means their journey would be longer and more difficult. Numbers 21:4–5 . Why did the children of Israel speak against the Lord and Moses? Numbers 21:6 . In response, what did the Lord send? Numbers 21:7–9 . What did the Lord instruct Moses and the children of Israel to do to be healed? 1 Nephi 17:41 ; Alma 33:18–21 . Why did some of the children of Israel not look? Consider inviting students to write the Book of Mormon verses as cross-references to Numbers 21:9 or highlight footnote 9a . What stood out to you from this account? How might we be similar at times to the children of Israel? A symbol for the Savior During His mortal ministry, the Savior helped us understand what the brass serpent on the pole symbolized. Read John 3:14–16 , looking for the answer. (You may want to mark this as a cross-reference to Numbers 21:7–9 .) After students share what they found, consider showing the following images. What can we learn from these accounts? Students may share a principle similar to the following: As we look to the Savior in faith , He will heal us spiritually . Consider writing this principle on the board. To better understand this principle, invite students to read the following statements. President Russell M. Nelson taught: I plead with you to come unto Him so that He can heal you! He will heal you from sin as you repent. He will heal you from sadness and fear. He will heal you from the wounds of this world. (“ The Answer Is Always Jesus Christ ,” Liahona , May 2023, 127) What did you like or learn from this statement? How might being healed from venom be like being healed by the Savior from the consequences of sin? Look to the Savior Invite students to take a minute to look at the picture of the Savior on the cross and ponder ways we can look to Him in faith today. Then invite them to do the following in small groups. List several ways we can look to the Savior in faith today. Discuss reasons we may struggle to do these things. (You might discuss why we, like the children of Israel, might be tempted to believe these ways to look to the Savior are too simple or will not help us.) Despite any struggles, discuss why it is worth it to look to the Savior. (This might include sharing scriptural examples of the Savior’s healings, your feelings or testimony about looking to the Savior, or experiences you have had when you looked to the Savior in faith and what happened.) If students need some ideas of ways we can look to the Savior, invite them to look for examples from the young man in “ Atonement: Not a One-Time Thing ” (3:00). 3:1 Ask students to share some of the highlights of their discussions. If students do not naturally share feelings, testimony, or experiences, consider giving them the following prompt: I believe it is worth it to look to the Savior in faith because . The activity above is an example of helping students consider their feelings about Jesus Christ. Helping students do this can allow the Holy Ghost to testify of Him. (For additional training see: “ Bear testimony often and invite learners to share their feelings, experiences, and testimonies ,” in Teacher Development Skills ). As students share, be sure it is clear that the Savior will help and heal us in the way and time that is best for us. What you believe Seek the help of the Holy Ghost as you write down one way you believe the Lord wants you to look to Him, or continue to look to Him, in your life. You also might write why it may be difficult but still worth it.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 58 ---\nAfter guiding the Israelites for 40 years in the wilderness, Moses shared his final counsel with them before the Lord commanded Joshua to lead them into the promised land. An important part of Moses’s prophetic message was to “love the Lord thy God with all thine heart” ( Deuteronomy 6:5 ). This lesson can help students understand how they can show their love for God. Student preparation: Invite students to ask a parent, guardian, or Church leader to share some of their favorite nonverbal ways of showing that they love someone. It may be helpful to tell students that the lesson will focus on ways we can show our love for God. Possible Learning Activities Showing love Consider using the following activity to help students brainstorm various ways they can show love. In your study journal, write the name of a family member you love. In 60 seconds, list under their name as many unique ways to show your love for them as you can. Ask a few volunteers to share the name they wrote and some ideas they had for showing love. When students are done sharing, invite them to read Deuteronomy 6:5 and share what they learn. (Students may share in their own words a truth such as: God commands us to love Him with all our heart, soul, and might .) You might suggest that students link or cross-reference this verse to the doctrinal mastery passage Matthew 22:36–39 , where Jesus Christ emphasized its importance. Consider writing Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in the middle of the board. Give students two minutes to come to the board and list different ways we can express our love for Them. Then encourage students to share which of their classmates’ ideas stand out to them and why. Ponder the following questions. What are your true feelings for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Why do you feel that way? What are some of the ways you show Them how you feel? As you study the book of Deuteronomy this week, pay attention to impressions from the Holy Ghost. His influence can deepen your love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, and teach you ways you can express that love to Them. God loves us with all His heart To help students learn from God’s example, they could be invited to link or cross-reference Deuteronomy 6:5 to 1 John 4:19 . After reading verse 19, you might ask students to share ways God has shown His love for everyone or for them personally. The following statement can help students reflect on God’s perfect example of loving us with all His heart. Consider displaying it and inviting a student to read it aloud. Then continue to display it while students discuss their answers to the questions below. President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles helped us better understand the true character of God. 19:24 The first great commandment of all eternity is to love God with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength—that’s the first great commandment. But the first great truth of all eternity is that God loves us with all of His heart, might, mind, and strength. That love is the foundation stone of eternity, and it should be the foundation stone of our daily life. Indeed it is only with that reassurance burning in our soul that we can have the confidence to keep trying to improve, keep seeking forgiveness for our sins, and keep extending that grace to our neighbor. (“ Tomorrow the Lord Will Do Wonders among You ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 127) What do you learn from President Holland’s statement that could motivate us to show our love for God? What are some steps someone could take toward loving God “with all [their] might” if they don’t feel strong enough to do it yet? Obedience is an expression of love To give students a brief context of the book of Deuteronomy, consider displaying the image of Moses from the beginning of the lesson as you summarize or invite a student to read aloud the following paragraph. After serving as a prophet of God for 40 years, Moses instructed the Israelites to make camp on the border of the promised land. Joshua would soon lead them across the border (see Deuteronomy 31:23 ). Moses was able to view the promised land from a mountaintop before the Lord translated him, or took Moses unto Himself without Moses dying (see Deuteronomy 34:1–6 ; Alma 45:18–19 ). The book of Deuteronomy contains Moses’s final counsel to the people, including inspired counsel about loving God and obeying His commandments. Read the following passages, looking for similarities between what Moses taught his people and what Jesus taught His disciples about how to show our love for God. Deuteronomy 6:1–6 ; 30:16 John 14:15, 21–24 What did you learn about showing our love for God? If a student already listed “keeping the commandments” on the board earlier as one way to show our love for God, consider pointing it out. If they didn’t, consider adding it to the board. Why do you think keeping the commandments is a meaningful way to show Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that we love Them? Loving God in our everyday lives It may be helpful for students to discuss realistic ways they can express their love for God in their lives. One way to do this is to show the video “ If We Love Him ” (3:57) ( ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). Invite students to pay attention to both the lyrics of the song and what they see youth in the video doing to show their love for God. Then invite students to share what they learned about ways to show our love for God. 3:57 Another option could be to give small groups of students a piece of paper with one of the common settings listed below written on it. Display the following instructions and questions for groups to complete and discuss. (Depending on available time, groups could exchange papers with other groups and repeat the activity multiple times.) Select one of these common settings: at work, at school, at seminary, at church, at home, at practice, with friends, on social media . How would you answer the following questions from your experience with this setting in mind? In this setting, how have you seen someone show their love for God? What are some appropriate ways to express your love for God in this setting? Is there anything that might make expressing love for God difficult in this setting? If so, how could we overcome it? Conclusion To conclude, you may want to express your love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. In addition to your testimony, you may also want to share the following statement and invite students to express their feelings for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in their study journal. Encourage them to act on any impressions they may have received from the Spirit during the lesson. Elder K. Brett Nattress of the Seventy asked some important questions for us to ponder personally. I testify that our Heavenly Father always remembers us and that He loves us perfectly. My question is this: Do we remember Him? And do we love Him? (“ Have I Truly Been Forgiven? ,” Liahona , May 2023, 68–69)\n\n\n--- Lesson 59 ---\nAfter years of being guided and protected by God through the wilderness, the Israelites were about to settle in their promised land. Though arriving at their new home would be a welcomed change, comfort could also tempt them to forget God. Through Moses, the Lord taught the Israelites how important it would be for them to remember what He had done for them. This lesson is intended to help students increase their desire to remember what God has done for them. Student preparation: Invite students to think of five things they feel the Lord has done for them in the past week. Invite them to reflect on how noticing what the Lord is doing for them can bless their life. Possible Learning Activities It can be easy to “forget the Lord” Consider beginning class by discussing the temptation to forget God when things are going well in our lives. One way to do this is to show pictures such as the following and ask the questions below. In which of these situations might people be more likely to remember and rely on God? Why? Why might it be more difficult to remember God and rely on Him when life is going well for us? Why is it important to remember God in all circumstances? Invite students to finish the following sentences in their study journal. Thinking specifically about your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, complete the following statements: When things are going well in my life, I tend to . When things are going poorly in my life, I tend to . Encourage students to seek the Spirit to help them better understand the value of remembering Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and what They have done for them. Remembering the Lord Consider reading or summarizing the following paragraph to help students understand what was happening in the Israelites’ lives in the book of Deuteronomy. After leading the children of Israel for 40 years in the wilderness, the Lord was ready to bring them over the Jordan River into the promised land. Since leaving Egypt, the Israelites had depended on the Lord for food, water, and protection. The Israelites had now become a mighty army, and the promised land had many natural resources that would make their lives much more comfortable. Consider inviting students to read the following verses and discuss the questions below with partners or in small groups. Read Deuteronomy 4:7–9 ; 6:10–13 ; and 8:7–14 , looking for a repeated warning Moses gave the Israelites. Why do you think Moses was worried about this? Why do you think Moses’s counsel is still needed by members of the Savior’s Church today? If needed, help students see that Moses was worried that prosperity would cause the Israelites to forget God. Display the following statement for students to refer to as they identify bolded truths. Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained why Heavenly Father wants us to remember Him and His Son. Our Heavenly Father wants us to recall His and His Beloved Son’s goodness, not for Their own gratification but for the influence such remembrance has on us. By considering Their kindness, our perspective and understanding are enlarged. By reflecting on Their compassion, we become more humble, prayerful, and steadfast. … Every time we use, benefit from, or even think of these gifts, we ought to consider the sacrifice, generosity, and compassion of the givers. Reverence for the givers does more than just make us grateful. Reflecting on Their gifts can and should transform us. (“ Consider the Goodness and Greatness of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2020, 41–42) What stands out to you from Elder Renlund’s statement? Based on what stands out to them, invite students to complete the following statement in their journals: By remembering the goodness of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, … Students might come up with several ways to complete the statement. Some examples include: … our perspective and understanding are enlarged. … we become more humble, prayerful, and steadfast. … we can be transformed (or changed). You may want to list students’ answers on the board. Make sure students understand the meaning of these blessings. One way to do this is to ask what it looks like to receive these blessings. For example, what might it look like to be prayerful or to be more steadfast? Why do you think remembering the Lord leads to such significant blessings? How have you experienced any of the truths that Elder Renlund shared? Remembering the Lord can help us face challenges To obtain the promised land, the Israelites faced a challenge. The Lord told them they would have to defeat mightier nations ( Deuteronomy 7:1 ). Knowing that the nations were mightier than they were might have made many of the Israelites nervous. To help students relate the scriptures to their own lives, consider asking them to list on the board situations that they are facing or will face that they know they need the Lord’s help with. Read Deuteronomy 7:17–21 ; 8:2–4, 15 to see what the Lord wanted the Israelites to remember as they dealt with future challenges. How could remembering what the Lord has done in the past be helpful when facing challenges in the future? You might invite students to list situations when they know the Lord helped them or others in the past. If you invited students to do the student preparation, this could be a good opportunity to ask them what the Lord has done for them in the past week. Ask students to share how remembering what the Lord has done in the past can help them as they face current and future difficulties. How we can remember the Lord To help students feel the value of remembering Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and to see one way to help us remember Them, consider showing the video “ O Remember, Remember ” (1:28) found on Gospel Library. You could invite students to look for what President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency did to see the Lord’s hand and the results that followed. 1:28 What effect might it have on you to see God’s hand in your daily life? To conclude, consider inviting students to write one or two ways they could better remember Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and invite Their blessings into their lives.\n\n\n--- Lesson 60 ---\nThe Savior’s commandments to the Israelites in Deuteronomy include forgiving debtors, releasing people in servitude, and relieving the burden of the poor. As His people, we too have a covenant responsibility to freely share what the Savior has given us to relieve the burden of the poor. This lesson can help students feel a greater desire to follow the Savior’s commandment to share what He has given them. Student preparation: Invite students to prayerfully sing or study the words to the hymn “ Because I Have Been Given Much ” ( Hymns , no. 219) or Matthew 25:31–40 . Students could ask Heavenly Father to help them see ways they can share with others what He has given them. Possible Learning Activities True followers of Jesus Christ To begin class, consider displaying a favorite picture of Jesus Christ. You could write the following incomplete statement from President Nelson on the board. You may want to point out that there could be many correct ways to finish the statement. President Russell M. Nelson taught: One of the easiest ways to identify a true follower of Jesus Christ is . (“ Peacemakers Needed ,” Liahona , May 2023, 98) What are some ways we could complete President Nelson’s statement? After students respond, invite them to share why they feel their response completes the statement. You could compliment and validate what students share. Then display President Nelson’s completed statement. One of the easiest ways to identify a true follower of Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people. (“ Peacemakers Needed ,” Liahona , May 2023, 98) Why is this a good way to identify true followers of Jesus Christ? What are some ways disciples of Jesus Christ could treat people compassionately? To help students assess how well they currently treat others, you might share some or all of the following statements and invite students to ponder how well each statement applies to them. The way I treat others shows that I am a follower of Jesus Christ. I have compassion for others and want to do what I can to help them. I feel willing to share what the Lord has given me with others. As you study today, seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to help you feel the importance of following the Savior’s commandment in the way you treat other people. Caring for people in need Before students read the following passage, you might explain that as part of the instructions given in Deuteronomy, the Lord commanded that all debts were to be forgiven every seventh year. Read Deuteronomy 15:7–11 , looking for how the Lord wants us to treat people around us. What did you discover? As students share, help them recognize a truth such as the Lord commands us to share the blessings He has given us. It might be helpful to use a simple object lesson to help students understand what it means to “open thine hand wide” to others ( verses 8 and 11 ). To do this you might have a bowl of dry cereal, beans, or small candy at the front of the room. Invite two students to demonstrate this phrase. One student could grab a handful of the item and hold it over the other student’s hands. Ask the student to open their hand “a little,” then “a little more,” allowing small amounts of food to fall into the other student’s hands. Finally, invite students to read verse 8 again and have the student demonstrating the object lesson “open thine hand wide.” What do you think it means that we are to open our hands wide in caring for the poor? What could we learn about the Savior from His commandment? How does He open His hand wide to us? In what circumstances might we be tempted to shut our hand from the poor? Before students read the following passage, you might explain that the Lord also commanded that every seventh year any servant who desired freedom was to be released from bondage. Read Deuteronomy 15:12–15 , looking for how the Lord told the Israelites they should treat a servant who desired to be freed from bondage. From what you’ve learned about the Israelites, how had they been in bondage physically and spiritually? How might someone be in spiritual bondage today? How could remembering how the Savior has delivered us from spiritual and physical bondage affect how we treat others? “Are we not all beggars?” Invite students to consider what it might look like for a teenager to be “poor” not only financially but also spiritually, physically, emotionally, and socially. How could we open our hand wide to someone in need in each of these ways? Use the scripture study tools to find a scripture passage or statement from a Church leader that could help someone follow the Savior’s commandment to care for the poor If students need additional assistance, you might suggest passages such as Luke 6:30–38 ; Mosiah 4:16–27 ; Doctrine and Covenants 104:15–18 ; Moses 7:18 . Students could also search Gospel Library for words like “poor.” After students have had time to find a scripture or statement, invite them to share what they found with a partner or in a small group. Students could also discuss the following questions. How could this scripture or statement apply to how we care for someone who is “poor” financially, spiritually, physically, emotionally, or socially? When have you had an experience being blessed by the generosity of others? To help students increase their desire to give generously to others, you could show the video “ The Coat ” (2:07) from Gospel Library. You might explain to students that this story depicts a childhood experience of President Heber J. Grant. Consider pausing the video after young Heber first sees the little boy with no coat. Invite students to review Deuteronomy 15:7–8 and share things Heber might do if he were to “open his hand wide” and how the Lord might bless him for his generosity. Then watch the remainder of the video. 2:8 Increase our desire to share with others Read Matthew 25:31–40 , looking for how the Savior feels about our efforts to care for people in need. Consider inviting students to read the words or sing the hymn “ Because I Have Been Given Much ” ( Hymns , no. 219). Invite them to look for words and phrases in the lyrics that help them feel the importance of the Savior’s commandment to share generously with others. Before sharing the following questions, you might remind students of the statement from President Nelson from the beginning of the lesson. Reminding students of this statement could help them connect the truths they have learned and felt today to the words of prophets. (For additional training on invitations that help connect students to the words of prophets, see “ Teach from the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets ” in Teacher Development Skills .) Students could answer the following questions in their study journals. What have you learned or felt today that has helped increase your desire to be a true follower of Jesus Christ by giving generously to others? What have you felt impressed to do? Consider sharing a time when your life has been blessed by the generosity of others who sought to be true followers of Jesus Christ. You might invite students to seek Heavenly Father’s guidance to find someone to serve and how to do it.",

Although this task may have seemed daunting, the Savior commanded Joshua to be strong and courageous, with a promise that He would not fail or forsake His prophet (see Joshua 1:5–6 ). This lesson can help increase students’ confidence that the Lord can help them be strong and courageous when they face challenges. Student preparation: Invite students to think of situations when a youth might need to demonstrate courage. Students could ask a family member or friend for experiences they have had that required courage. Possible Learning Activities Courage when facing challenges To begin class, consider writing the word Courage on the board. As students respond to the following questions, invite them to write their responses on the board. How was Jesus Christ an example of courage? What are some situations a teenager may face that would require courage? In your study journal, write down some of the challenges you are facing now or may face in the future that require courage. Self–assessment can help students evaluate their current situation and provide an opportunity for the Holy Ghost to meet their individual needs throughout the lesson. One way to do this could be to invite students to respond to the following prompts in their study journals. When I am asked to do something that seems challenging, I often feel . On a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), how confident do I feel that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will help me face my challenges with courage? Why? As you study today, pay attention to impressions from the Holy Ghost that can help you be courageous and increase your confidence that the Lord is with you. Joshua is ordained to lead the children of Israel Consider displaying an image of Moses ordaining Joshua, like the image from the beginning of this lesson (see Deuteronomy 34:9 ). Although Moses had been with the children of Israel since their deliverance from Egypt, the Lord called Joshua to lead them into the promised land. What are some of the challenges Joshua could have faced as the Lord’s prophet and military leader of Israel? Help students understand that Joshua would have the responsibility of the spiritual leadership of Israel. Joshua was also the military commander and would lead Israel to conquer the land from the Canaanites who were ripe in iniquity (see 1 Nephi 17:31–40 ). The Lord had promised this land to Abraham and his righteous posterity (see Joshua 1:1–4 ). Read Joshua 1:5–9 , marking repeated promises and instructions from the Lord that could have helped Joshua focus on Him when facing challenges. What do you find significant from these verses? How would you summarize a truth to help someone going through challenges? As students share truths they have identified, help them recognize that when we know the Lord is with us, we can be strong and courageous. You might use some or all of the following questions to help students understand this truth. Students might work with a partner or small group and then share what they discussed with the class. Think about the challenging situations listed on the board and in your journal. What might it look like to be strong and have courage when facing these challenges? What do you know about the Lord that could help someone be strong and have courage? How do you know this? Read Doctrine and Covenants 84:88 , looking for ways the Lord is with us. Ways to invite the Lord’s help The following activities can help students recognize ways to invite the Lord’s help when they need to be strong and courageous. Invite students to choose one of the activities. After an appropriate amount of time, students could share what they learned with those who chose the other activity. You might provide one of the statements available in Additional Resources for students to study with each activity. Activity A: Obedience to God’s law Read Joshua 1:7 and one or more of the following scriptures: John 15:10 ; 1 Nephi 3:7 ; Mosiah 2:41 ; Doctrine and Covenants 93:20 . What connections do you see between obeying God’s commandments and being strong and courageous? What are some ways Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ could bless us because of our obedience? Activity B: Meditating on God’s word Read Joshua 1:8 and one or more of the following scriptures: 2 Timothy 3:15–17 ; 2 Nephi 31:20 ; 32:3 . What helps you meditate on scriptures? How do you think meditating on God’s words can help you feel close to Him? Reviewing goals can help students recognize the progress they have made and make any needed adjustments to their goal. Encourage students to review the scripture study goal they may have set. Then invite them to evaluate their progress and make any adjustments to their goal. (For additional training on reminding students of their scripture study goals, see “ Encourage learners to come to know the Savior by studying the gospel daily—study goal ” in Teacher Development Skills [2022], 31.) Remembering the Lord is with us What are some ways you have felt the Lord with you during your challenges? Provide an opportunity for students to reflect on what they have learned and felt today. They could invite the Spirit to help them see how their efforts have increased their confidence that the Lord will be with them. In your study journal, think about the challenges you face now or may face in the future. What have you learned or felt about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that can help you be strong and courageous when facing challenges? From what you learned or felt about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, what do you want to remember the next time you feel uncertain about your ability to handle a difficult situation? Consider sharing your witness that the Lord will keep His promise to be with us always, never failing or forsaking us, just as He promised Joshua.\n\n\n--- Lesson 62 ---\nAfter the Israelites’ journey through the wilderness, the Lord commanded Joshua to lead them into the promised land. Entering the promised land required them to exercise faith in Jesus Christ. The children of Israel and a woman named Rahab demonstrated their faith in Jesus Christ. This lesson can help students understand how they can exercise faith in Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to find a scripture that helps them understand what it means to have faith in Jesus Christ. Ask them to come prepared to share it in class. If needed, they could look up “Faith” in the Topical Guide or Guide to the Scriptures. Possible Learning Activities Faith in Jesus Christ Consider beginning class by inviting a student to think of a word that represents their hobbies or interests—for example, basketball or singing . Ask students to describe their words without using the word itself. Class members can guess the word. Next, write faith on the board, and invite students to describe faith in Jesus Christ. They could share what they found as part of their preparation for class. You might want to point out that Heavenly Father wants us to exercise faith in Jesus Christ so that He can save and bless us (see 2 Nephi 26:13 ; Ether 12:12, 18 ; Moroni 7:33 ). Remind students that one of the roles of the Holy Ghost is to guide us to truth (see John 16:13 ). Encourage students to invite the Holy Ghost to help them better understand faith in Jesus Christ. How might increasing your faith in Jesus Christ help you in your current circumstances? Read what Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught about faith in Jesus Christ, or watch the video “ Seek Learning by Faith ” from time code 3:15 to 4:33. The video is located on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 33:36 The Apostle Paul defined faith as “the substance of things hoped for [and] the evidence of things not seen” ( Hebrews 11:1 ). Alma declared that faith is not a perfect knowledge; rather, if we have faith, we “hope for things which are not seen [but] are true” ( Alma 32:21 ). Additionally, we learn in the Lectures on Faith that faith is … “the principle of action in all intelligent beings.” These teachings highlight three basic elements of faith: (1) faith as the assurance of things hoped for that are true, (2) faith as the evidence of things not seen, and (3) faith as the principle of action in all intelligent beings. I describe these three components of faith in the Savior as simultaneously facing the future, looking to the past, and initiating action in the present. (“ Seek Learning by Faith ,” Ensign , Sept. 2007, 61–62) The image “ Exercising faith in Jesus Christ ” can help students understand Elder Bednar’s definition of faith in Jesus Christ. Draw the image on the board or display it for students to reference throughout the lesson. Open PDF What has God done in the past that can help you have faith in Him? How can having hope in God’s promised blessings help you exercise faith in Him? How would you summarize Elder Bednar’s teachings about faith in Jesus Christ? Help students identify a truth like: We exercise faith in Jesus Christ as we face the future, look to the past, and act in the present. Examples of faith The stories in Joshua 2–4 illustrate one or more of these elements of exercising faith in Jesus Christ. Help students study these stories. One way is to create a learning station for each chapter. You could place one section of the handout “ Examples of Faith in Jesus Christ from Joshua 2–4 ” in three different areas of the classroom. Students could rotate through each station and follow the instructions on the handout. For larger classes, you might want to create multiple learning stations for each section. Allow students to participate individually or in small groups. If possible, you could display the following at each learning station: A red thread for Joshua 2 A pair of shoes for Joshua 3 A stone for Joshua 4 Open PDF If students have questions about the destruction of the people in Jericho, you can refer to the question “Why were the Canaanites destroyed?” in the Additional Resources section of Lesson 63: “ Joshua 23–24 .” After enough time, invite students to share with the class what they learned about faith in Jesus Christ. Students could hold the red thread, the shoes, or the stone as they share. Questions such as the following could help. What have you learned about exercising faith in Jesus Christ? How could what you learned help youth today? Consider inviting students to share how they or someone they know has exercised faith in Jesus Christ by facing the future, acting in the present, and looking to the past. You could also share a personal experience about exercising faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n\n--- Lesson 63 ---\nAt the end of his life, Joshua reminded the Israelites who the Lord is and what He had done for them. Joshua invited them to choose to serve the Lord instead of false gods. This lesson can help students choose to serve the Lord over other influences. Student preparation: Invite students to bring a small rock to class. They will use it as a reminder of the plan they will make in the lesson. Possible Learning Activities The influence of distractions Consider inviting students to create a list of the top five things that can distract youth from choosing to serve the Lord. Students could work individually or as a group. Ask students to share their lists. What about these distractions might make them seem more appealing or more important than serving the Lord? You might explain that, if we are not careful, these distractions can become a modern version of worshipping and serving gods other than the Lord. What might be the long-term effect of continually choosing these influences over the Lord? Invite students to ponder the following questions or record their answers in their study journals. How might you be serving the Lord or serving something or someone else through your daily choices? What might be the long-term effect if you continue to make these choices? Invite students to seek the help of the Spirit to recognize what choices they can make to serve the Lord. The Lord our God A student could read the following paragraph to summarize Joshua 5–24 . After leading the Israelites over the Jordan River on dry ground (see Joshua 3–4 ), the Lord blessed the Israelites in their many battles with the Canaanites. The Israelites took possession of the land that God had promised them (see Joshua 5–12 ). The land was divided among the twelve tribes (see Joshua 13–22 ). Toward the end of his life, Joshua gave one final message to the Israelites (see Joshua 23–24 ). For the following activity, you could invite half of the class to read Joshua 23:3–11 , and the other half to read Joshua 24:3–11 . Students could mark what they find in their scriptures. Read Joshua 23:3–11 ; 24:3–11 , looking for what the Lord had done and would do for Israel. Invite students to share. You might do this by either writing their answers on the board as they share or asking students to come to the board to write what they found. Then, to help students reflect on how they have seen the Lord work in their lives, ask the following question. You could invite them to think about examples from Church history, general conference, their own lives, or the life of someone in their ward or family. What are some examples of how the Lord has blessed us today? Joshua 24:15 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. To help students understand Joshua 24:14–15 , you could invite them to rewrite what Joshua taught in their own words. They could rewrite the verses in partnerships or small groups. Read Joshua 24:14–15 . Rewrite what Joshua taught as if he were teaching the same thing today. Invite students to share how they rewrote Joshua’s counsel. Students might share something like “Stop following all these other influences around you and choose to follow the Lord! You can choose what you want, but I’m going to serve the Lord.” To help students identify a clear statement of truth, you could ask a question like the following. How would you summarize Joshua’s teachings in verse 15 ? Students might summarize verse 15 using words like we can use our agency to choose to serve the Lord . As you ask the following question, consider referring students to the answers they listed in the chart. What are ways that we can serve the Lord today? How can what you know about the Lord help you choose to serve Him? Choosing to serve the Lord Read Joshua 24:24–25 , looking for what the Israelites chose to do. To help students connect what they have learned to their own choices, consider asking them to write answers to the following questions. In your study journal, respond to one of the following sets of questions: What do you want to remember about the Lord that can help you serve Him when it might be difficult? How do you think remembering the Lord in those moments could help you? What will you start doing or stop doing to choose to serve the Lord? What blessings might you experience from doing that? You might want to ask willing students to share what they wrote down. Remind them not to share anything too personal. You could also share your testimony of the Lord and explain why you choose to love and serve Him instead of other things. Read Joshua 24:26–27 , looking for what Joshua did to remind the Israelites of their choice to serve the Lord. If students brought a rock to class, they could take it out now. Or they could draw a picture of a rock. Discuss where Joshua laid the stone (under the oak tree) and why he put it there (to remind the children of Israel of the covenant they made to serve the Lord). Ask students where they can put their rock to remind themselves of their plan to serve the Lord. Invite them to put their rock in a prominent place they will see regularly. They could also write something on the rock that reminds them of the Lord or their plan to serve Him, like “I will serve the Lord.” You might want to share the following statement with students. Testify of the long-term effect of choosing to serve the Lord. Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught about the long-term effect of choosing to serve the Lord: We need to choose whom we will serve. The magnitude of our eternal happiness depends on choosing the living God and joining Him in His work. … Choosing to follow the Father’s plan is the only way we can become inheritors in His kingdom. (“ Choose You This Day ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 106) Memorize You might want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Joshua 24:15 is “Choose you this day whom ye will serve.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 65 ---\nAfter the children of Israel entered the promised land, they chose to disobey the Lord’s commandment to drive out all of the wicked inhabitants. As a result, many Israelites adopted the wicked practices of these people and lost the Lord’s protection. However, each time the Israelites cried unto the Lord for deliverance, He “raised up a deliverer” for them ( Judges 3:9 ). This lesson can help students understand the Savior’s role as our Deliverer. Student preparation: Invite students to think of a time when the Savior delivered (rescued or set free) someone in the scriptures, someone they know, or themselves. Students could identify what the individual or individuals did to reach out to the Savior for deliverance. Possible Learning Activities Patterns To prepare students to learn about a spiritual pattern found in the book of Judges, consider displaying the following numerical patterns. Invite small groups of students to fill in the missing numbers. Find the next two numbers in each of the following sequences: A. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, , B. 1, 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, , C. 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, , D. 10, 11, 6, 8, 4, 7, 4, , If students need help, you could share the following patterns: A: +2 B: +2, +4, +6, and so on C: +3, −1, +3, −1 D: +1, −5, +2, −4, +3, −3, and so on What are situations in our lives when it might be helpful to identify patterns? Why is it important to recognize spiritual patterns in our lives? Today as you study a spiritual pattern the Israelites experienced in the book of Judges, think about how it could apply to your life. Invite the Holy Ghost to teach you more about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you study this pattern. The cycle of sin and deliverance When the Israelites entered the promised land, the Lord commanded them to drive out the wicked inhabitants (see Deuteronomy 7:1–4 ). Many Israelites chose not to fully obey this commandment. They allowed some of the wicked inhabitants to remain (see Judges 1:21, 27–28 ). In Judges 2–4 , we learn about a spiritual pattern, or cycle, the Israelites experienced because they repeatedly failed to follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Consider displaying the following cycle on the board. Invite students to copy it in their study journals. Invite the students to study the following verses with a partner or small group, looking for the pattern of behavior that occurred among the Israelites. Students could summarize each set of verses with a word or phrase. They could then write that word or phrase in the appropriate box on their diagrams. 1. Judges 3:5–7 (Note: Baalim is the plural form of Baal, a false god worshipped in Canaan. The term groves refers to “a living tree or a tree-like pole, set up as an object of worship” [Bible Dictionary, “ Grove ”].) 2. Judges 3:8 3. Judges 3:9 (first phrase of verse) 4. Judges 3:9–11 After students have studied the verses, invite them to share the words or phrases they included on their diagrams. If needed, you could offer the following suggestions for each box: 1. Sin ; 2. Consequences ; 3. Cry unto the Lord ; 4. Deliverance through the Lord . To help students record this cycle in their scriptures, you could invite them to write the word or phrase from each box by each set of verses. Then display the following instructions. Give students a few minutes to study some or all of the references. To see other examples of this cycle in Judges 2–4 , study some of the following references. As you notice different elements of the cycle, you could label them in your scriptures. (Note: Not every element of the cycle will appear in every set of verses.) Judges 2:10–18 Judges 3:12–15, 26–30 Judges 4:1–4, 14–16 What can we learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from this cycle in Judges 2–4 ? As students share answers to the previous question, consider pointing out their insights that show God’s love and attributes. One way to do this is to make simple statements after students share. You could say, “Thank you for your insight about the merciful nature of Jesus Christ” or “I’m grateful for your reminder of the power the Savior has to deliver us” or “Why is it important to know that Heavenly Father also has that attribute that you noticed in the Savior?” (For additional training on helping students come unto Jesus Christ, see “ Help Learners Strengthen Their Relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills [2022], 9.) Some truths students might discover about the Lord in these passages are: If we choose to reject the Lord, we will lose His guidance and protection in our lives. As we choose to turn to the Lord and call upon His name, He will deliver us. How do you think understanding these truths could affect your life? The Deliverer Explain that one of the titles of the Savior is Deliverer (see 2 Samuel 22:2 ). Students could read and compare Mosiah 7:33 to Judges 3:9 . Ask them to share how the individuals who helped deliver the Israelites in the book of Judges symbolize Jesus Christ. To help students pause and personalize what they have been learning, you could write “me” on the board in the center of the cycle. Invite students to ponder where they might currently be in the cycle. Ask them to think about situations in their lives where they need the Savior’s deliverance. Elder Kyle S. McKay of the Seventy testified of how Jesus Christ is the Great Deliverer: 11:39 I bear witness that Jesus Christ is the Great Deliverer, and in His name, I promise that as you turn to Him with real intent and full purpose of heart, He will deliver you from everything that threatens to diminish or destroy your life or joy. (“ The Immediate Goodness of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 107) What thoughts or feelings do you have as you reflect on this statement? Consider giving students time to list in their journals or on the board any threats that could “diminish or destroy [their] life or joy.” If helpful, students could study the article “ The Savior Can Deliver Us ” (Jessica Z. Strong, For the Strength of Youth , Dec. 2022, 2–4), looking for examples. Next to the list they created, students could write responses to the following question. What are some ways the Savior can deliver us when we turn to Him? Help students discover additional ways the Savior can deliver us as we turn to Him. They could think of examples of the Savior’s deliverance in the scriptures, their own lives, or the lives of people they know. You could invite students to find scriptures that teach about the Lord’s power to deliver, such as Alma 36:27–29 ; 38:5 . They could also read “ 7 Ways the Lord Can Deliver You ” (David A. Edwards, For the Strength of Youth , Apr. 2022, 18–20). Invite volunteers to share their insights. You could also invite them to explain how remembering these examples can help them strengthen their faith and trust in the Savior. Demonstrate understanding To help students demonstrate their understanding of the Savior’s role as Deliverer, display the following instructions. They could complete the activity with a partner or a small group. Create a scenario about a young person who needs the Savior’s deliverance from a certain situation. Write a paragraph that summarizes what you have learned about how the Savior can deliver this person. Consider having students complete step 1 and then share their scenario with a different partnership or group. They could then complete step 2 in response to the other group’s scenario. You could conclude this lesson by sharing an experience or testimony of the Savior’s power to deliver.\n\n\n--- Lesson 66 ---\nAfter the Israelites prayed for deliverance, the Lord called Gideon to deliver them from their enemies. The Lord demonstrated His strength by helping the Israelites defeat an army of over 135,000 soldiers with only 300 of Gideon’s men. This lesson can help students feel a greater desire to rely on Jesus Christ for strength. Student preparation: Invite students to find a scripture that demonstrates the strength we can receive from the Lord. Come to class prepared to share it. Possible Learning Activities Different types of strength On the board, consider drawing a stick figure holding weights in each hand, like the following: Ask the following questions. If useful, hand multiple students markers, and have them write one of their answers around the drawing on the board. Who are some people you would consider to be “strong”? What are different ways a person could be seen as strong? Explain that one type of strength is a person’s ability to rely on the Lord. Consider giving students the chance to assess how much they rely on the Lord in challenging situations that they might face. You might use the following situations or think of others more relevant to your students. Think about how likely you are to rely on God’s strength in different situations. For each situation listed below, determine where you would place yourself on the following diagram. Making important decisions Dealing with an injury or sickness Improving as a person Working through challenges with family or friends As you study about Gideon today, pray for Heavenly Father to help you feel the importance of relying on the Lord for strength in your life. Pay attention to thoughts or feelings that God may send you through the Holy Ghost. Gideon and the Israelites To help students understand the context of Judges 6 , you might review the graphic of the pride cycle from Lesson 65: “ Judges 2–4 .” You could also read or summarize the following paragraph. Judges 6 describes another instance when the Israelites forgot the Lord and lost His blessings. A group of people called the Midianites began to oppress the Israelites. For seven years the Midianites plundered the Israelites’ grain and animals during the seasons of harvest. As a result, the Israelites suffered poverty. In desperation, they turned to the Lord for help. After the Israelites remembered the Lord and cried unto Him, He raised up a righteous man named Gideon to deliver them from their enemies. To help students see how the Lord blessed Gideon and his army for relying on Him for their strength, consider using the handout “ Seeing the Lord’s Strength in the Account of Gideon .” Allow each student to become familiar with the content of each section of the handout. There are several ways you might do this. One way would be to arrange students into groups of three and assign each member a section of the handout. Students could complete their section and then teach the other group members what they learned. They could go in the order of the sections on the handout. Another way would be to invite students to work on the first section of the handout with a partner. After sufficient time, students could switch partners and work on the second section, and then again with the third section. Open PDF Relying on the Lord After students have finished the handout, invite them to share a summary of what they learned from Gideon’s story. Ask a few students to share the truth they wrote for study activity 3. The following is one example: If we rely on the Lord, He will bless us with His strength. What are different ways the Lord can strengthen us? How can we rely on the Lord today? To further understand this truth, invite students to imagine their friend texted them. The friend is in a situation where they feel their strength is not enough. Have students share a few examples of what this situation could be. Ask the class to select a situation that they feel would be most meaningful to address today. Prepare an answer that you could text back. Write it in your study journal. If you want, draw a phone with text bubbles, and write your answer inside. Your answer should include at least two of the following: 1. How the example of Gideon could help. 2. How other scriptures might help your friend rely on the Lord. (Some examples are Proverbs 3:5–6 ; Philippians 4:13 ; Alma 26:12 ; Ether 12:27 . You could also look up “ Strength ” in the Topical Guide or “ Trust ” in the Guide to the Scriptures.) 3. What you know about the Lord that helps you rely on Him. 4. Experiences you have had when you have felt the Lord strengthen you beyond your own abilities. Invite several students to share their answers. Look for ways to thank them for their participation and to point out how meaningful their responses can be to you and their classmates. It might be helpful to share a personal experience about how you have been strengthened by relying on the Lord. You might also show the video “ Just Keep Going—with Faith ” ( ChurchofJesusChrist.org ) from time code 6:08 to 9:47. Elder Carl B. Cook of the Seventy shared an experience when he was a new Area Seventy. He was assigned to attend a stake conference with President Boyd K. Packer. When Elder Cook asked President Packer how he wanted to plan the meeting, President Packer said he wanted to follow the Spirit. 11:5 Conclusion Invite students to seek Heavenly Father’s guidance as they answer the following questions in their study journals. What is an area in your life where you feel like your own strength is not enough? What do you know or what have you learned about the Lord that would help you rely on Him? How do you feel about the Lord and His help?",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 68 ---\nBecause the price of salvation is too high for us alone to pay, we each need to be redeemed. The account of Ruth, Naomi, and Boaz in the Old Testament is a story of physical redemption that symbolizes Jesus Christ’s role as our personal Redeemer. This lesson is intended to help students feel a greater desire to trust in Jesus Christ and His redeeming power. Student preparation: Invite students to consider why one of Jesus Christ’s titles is Redeemer. Encourage them to ponder how Jesus Christ redeems us from physical and spiritual death. (They might refer to “ Redeem, Redeemed, Redemption ” in Guide to the Scriptures for help.) Encourage them to come prepared to share their thoughts with the class. Possible Learning Activities What does it mean that Jesus Christ is our Redeemer? You might begin class by displaying the following image of Jesus Christ or another of your choice and writing the word Redeemer on the board. Display the quote from Elder Christofferson and invite students to answer the two questions in their study journal. Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained: Among the most significant of Jesus Christ’s descriptive titles is Redeemer. … The word redeem means to pay off an obligation or a debt. Redeem can also mean to rescue or set free. (“ Redemption ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2013, 109) In what ways might you and others need to be redeemed by Jesus Christ? How much do you want to trust in Jesus Christ’s redeeming power in your life? Why? Invite students to consider how confident they are in their answers and what they might like to understand better or feel about the Savior and His redeeming power. You may want to summarize the next paragraph in your own words. You may also want to write the bolded truth on the board near the word Redeemer. Redemption is one of the prominent themes in the account of Ruth. As you study Ruth’s story, consider how likening this account to ourselves can help us learn that if we come to Jesus Christ, He will redeem us. Seek the help of the Holy Ghost to know ways we are like Ruth and need redemption and how Boaz is like the Savior Jesus Christ and redeems us. The account of Ruth You might read or explain the following summary. In a time of famine, an Israelite woman named Naomi, her husband, and her two sons moved from Bethlehem to Moab, a neighboring country with a different culture and religious beliefs. While there, the sons each married Moabite women, Ruth and Orpah. Tragically, Naomi’s husband and two sons died, leaving the three women widows. Naomi chose to return to Bethlehem. Unable to care for her daughters-in-law, Naomi encouraged them to return to their families in Moab. Orpah returned to her family. Read Ruth 1:8–9, 14–17 , looking for Ruth’s response to Naomi. What are some of the uncertainties and difficulties Ruth might face by going to Bethlehem with Naomi? After hearing what students share, you could explain some of the following: By going with Naomi, Ruth would leave behind family in Moab. Ruth would be a foreigner in an unfamiliar land with a different culture. Without husbands, Ruth and Naomi would face extreme poverty. Ruth’s choice showed her willingness to worship and rely on Jehovah (Jesus Christ), not the false gods of the Moabites. (You might invite students to mark the phrase “and thy God my God” in verse 16 .) Knowing Ruth’s circumstances, what stands out to you about her response? Boaz redeems Ruth To continue Ruth’s account, you could invite students to complete the handout “Ruth and Naomi Are Redeemed.” Students could work in pairs to write the important details of the story. Another option would be to give students the scripture blocks of the handout and have them summarize the verses in their own words with a partner. Open PDF After students complete the handout, you could explain any of the following that you feel would be useful: As part of the Law of Moses, Israelites were required to leave unharvested grain in the fields to care for the poor (see Leviticus 19:9–10 ). Naomi told Ruth that Boaz was one of their “next kinsmen” (see Ruth 2:20 ) or close relatives. The term “next kinsman” comes from the Hebrew word go-el , which means “redeemer.” A “next kinsman” was expected to care for (or even marry) widows in their family to restore them to safety and security. Because there was another kinsman more closely related who had the right to marry Ruth, Boaz purchased the right from him (see Ruth 3:12–13 ) before marrying Ruth (see Ruth 4:9–10, 13 ). It may be helpful to create a two-column chart on the board. Label the first column Ruth/Us and the second column Boaz/Jesus Christ . Students could list on the board what they find. In what ways might we be like Ruth? If students struggle to answer, consider asking them to think about how they may not have enough or be enough on their own. (This could include not having enough righteousness or obedience, not enough strength to overcome sin or weakness, not enough support to continue doing what is right, and so on.) You might also ask what Ruth did to seek redemption and how we may be similar. In what ways is Boaz like Jesus Christ? If students struggle to answer, consider inviting them to review Ruth 2:12, 15–16 . You might also point out that Boaz entered a covenant marriage or relationship with Ruth to always love and care for her. If needed, explain that the Savior redeems us in every way we need. Consider inviting students to read Mosiah 15:7–9 or Helaman 5:9–11 to identify how the Savior redeems us. You may also add that the Savior’s redemptive work includes helping us with our problems on earth (see D. Todd Christofferson, “ Redemption ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2013, 109–110). How would you describe the difference in Ruth’s situation before and after Boaz helped and married her? What lessons can we learn about our relationship with Jesus Christ through the story of Ruth and Boaz? Jesus Christ is our Redeemer Providing students opportunities to answer the next three questions may invite the Holy Ghost. As students share and listen to each other share, the Holy Ghost can help students feel a greater desire to trust in Jesus Christ and His redeeming power. To help students prepare to answer the first question, you might show “ Finding Your Purpose in Life: Does Faith Matter? ” (5:08) or “ Moving on from Past Mistakes ” (3:43), both are available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 5:9 3:43 When have you or someone you know felt the redeeming power of Jesus Christ? Why might you, like Ruth, want to trust in Jesus Christ and His redeeming power in the future? What do you think someone could do to increase their desire to trust in the Savior’s redeeming power? To conclude, invite students to consider what thoughts or impressions they received from the Holy Ghost about trusting the Lord and His redeeming power. They may want to add thoughts to the questions they answered at the beginning of the lesson in their study journals.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 69 ---\nHave you found yourself pleading to Heavenly Father for a blessing that seems to require your patience and faith? Hannah, a righteous Israelite woman, longed to have a child. Although her noble desires were unfulfilled “year by year” ( 1 Samuel 1:7 ), Hannah continued to act in faith and petition Heavenly Father for this blessing. Hannah’s humble prayers were answered as she received peace, joy, and a child she named Samuel. This lesson can help students understand that Heavenly Father will hear their humble prayers and bless them. Student preparation: Invite students to think of an experience when they or someone they know received an answer to prayer. Students could prepare to share that experience as part of the study activity. Possible Learning Activities When prayers feel unanswered Reverent music can invite the Holy Ghost into your classroom and prepare students’ hearts and minds for the learning experience. Consider beginning class by inviting students to select a favorite hymn that teaches the power of praying to Heavenly Father. Before the opening prayer, the class could sing or listen to the first verse of a song like “ A Child’s Prayer ,” ( Children’s Songbook , 12–13) or “ Did You Think to Pray ,” ( Hymns , no. 140). Students could also watch an appropriate video like “ Are You Really There? ” (3:46) or “ Abide with Me ,” (3:08) available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 3:45 3:9 As you begin the lesson, display the following scenario or something similar that best fits the needs of your class. Consider writing them on the board. After a seminary lesson on prayer, a friend approaches you and admits, “I say my prayers, but I’m not sure if they are answered.” As you talk, she asks three questions. How can I tell if Heavenly Father hears and answers my prayers? What are some of the ways Heavenly Father answers prayers? What can I do to make my prayers to Heavenly Father more meaningful? The following activity is a self-assessment. These opportunities allow students to evaluate their current understanding of truths they will study in class. It can also help students see what they may need or want to learn. On a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), rank how confidently you feel you could answer each question from the scenario. Select one question you would like to learn more about today. Write that question in your study journal. As you study, seek the guidance of the Spirit to help answer the question you selected. Hannah longs for a child In the land of Ephraim, a righteous Israelite named Elkanah lived with his two wives, Peninnah and Hannah (plural marriages were not uncommon at this time and were acceptable to the Lord). Read 1 Samuel 1:1–8 looking for the challenges Hannah was facing. (The “adversary” in verse 6 was possibly Peninnah.) What did you find? If you were struggling with personal challenges like Hannah, what might you think or feel? Though their situations are very different, you might ask how students how they could relate to Hannah. As students study the next passage, they might notice that initially Eli, the high priest, misunderstands Hannah’s humble prayer. Help students focus on Hannah, how she responds to Eli, and the blessing she receives from the Lord (see verse 20 ). If useful, point out that as they honestly spoke to one another, Eli quickly corrected his mistake. Students could watch the video “ Hannah’s Faith ” (3:08) available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org and follow along in their scriptures. You might pause at time code 1:03 and invite students to share their thoughts about verses 9–13 and pause again at time code 1:30 to invite students to share their insights about verses 14–20 . 3:9 Read 1 Samuel 1:9–20 and 2:1–2 looking for what Hannah did in response to her challenges. What did you discover? What can we learn about Heavenly Father and prayer from this account? Students may share a variety of thoughts. Thank them and ask why what they discovered is important to know. If students do not mention the following truth, write it on the board and ask how Hannah’s story is evidence of it: As we petition Heavenly Father in humble prayer, He hears and blesses us. What are some of the words or phrases in 1 Samuel 1:9–20 that show Hannah’s prayers were humble and meaningful? According to verses 17–18 , what comfort did the Lord give Hannah while she was waiting to be blessed with a child? It might be helpful to point out that we, like Hannah, may need to trust in the Lord and patiently wait for His blessings. He may not always respond in the way we would hope, but we can trust that He answers prayers according to His will and what is best for us. You could share an example of a humble, meaningful prayer that was not answered in the way expected, like “ How I #HearHim: Elder D. Todd Christofferson ” (2:25) from ChurchofJesusChrist.org or “ One–on–One (Ministering with Love) ” (time code 7:24 to 9:00). Alternately, you could share an example from your life. 2:25 13:2 Heavenly Father hears our prayers and blesses us You could use the following activity to deepen students’ understanding of the truth they identified above and answer the three questions from the beginning of the lesson. One way to do this is to provide or display the instructions below for each question (A, B, and C). You might give students the option to study individually or work in a small group with other students who selected the same question. You could also place students in groups of three, with each person having selected a different question to study. They could share what they find with the group. Question A: How might the story of Hannah help someone believe that Heavenly Father hears their prayers and blesses them? Use scripture study tools such as the Topical Guide, Guide to the Scriptures, and the Gospel Library to find a few scripture passages or a statement from a Church leader that could help someone understand that Heavenly Father answers prayers (for example, James 1:5–6 ; Enos 1:2–10 ; 3 Nephi 18:20 ; Doctrine and Covenants 90:24 ). Question B: How might the story of Hannah help someone understand some of the ways Heavenly Father answers their prayers? Use scripture study tools such as the Topical Guide, Guide to the Scriptures, and the Gospel Library to find a few scripture accounts or a statement from a Church leader that could help someone understand some of the ways Heavenly Father answers prayers (for example, Luke 22:39–44 ; 2 Corinthians 12:7–9 ; Mosiah 24:10–16 ; Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–23 ; 8:2–3 ). Question C: How might the story of Hannah help someone try to make their prayers more humble and meaningful? Use scripture study tools such as the Topical Guide, Guide to the Scriptures, and the Gospel Library to find a few scripture passages or a statement from a Church leader that could help someone who wants to make their prayers more humble and meaningful (for example, Enos 1:2–10 ; Alma 5:45–46 ; Ether 3:1–5 ; Doctrine and Covenants 46:30 ). Demonstrate understanding To help students share what they have learned and felt today, they could partner with someone who studied one of the other questions and teach each other. You might deepen the discussion by inviting students to share their thoughts with the class and encourage students who studied other questions to add additional insights. As you conclude class, reassure students that, like Hannah, sometimes we must wait for Heavenly Father to answer our prayers. In His way and timing, Heavenly Father does hear their prayers and will bless them.\n\n\n--- Lesson 70 ---\nHow well do you feel you can recognize the Lord’s voice in your life? One night the Lord spoke to the boy Samuel. With help from Eli, Samuel eventually recognized the Lord’s voice. He responded, “Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth” ( 1 Samuel 3:9 ). The Lord speaks to us too, and like Samuel, we need to learn to recognize His voice. This lesson can help students seek and recognize personal revelation. Student preparation: Ask students the question, “How do you hear the voice of the Lord in your life?” Invite them to reflect on how they would answer. They could also ask friends or family members the question. Possible Learning Activities Hearing the Lord’s voice Consider inviting a volunteer to the front of the class who is willing to be blindfolded. Place a blindfold on the student. One at a time, invite a few class members to call the student by name. Ask the blindfolded student to identify who called their name. Why were some of the voices easier to recognize? What are some spiritual lessons that could relate to this activity? Students may or may not share principles similar to the truths outlined in this lesson. If they do, invite them to look for evidence or understanding of these truths as they study 1 Samuel 3 . If not, that is fine. Thank all students for what they shared. Write the following truth on the board: God speaks to us and wants us to recognize His voice . Explain that the Lord speaks to us through the Holy Ghost (see Doctrine and Covenants 8:2 ). This is known as personal revelation. Students will identify additional principles of personal revelation throughout the lesson. President Russell M. Nelson taught: One of the things the Spirit has repeatedly impressed upon my mind … is how willing the Lord is to reveal His mind and will. The privilege of receiving revelation is one of the greatest gifts of God to His children. … Does God really want to speak to you? Yes! (“ Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 94–95) Invite students to reflect on the following questions: Do you believe God really wants to speak to you? Why or why not? How confident are you in your ability to recognize revelation? What makes it easy or difficult for you to recognize God’s voice (or personal revelation) in your life? Express your confidence that God wants to speak to your students. Throughout the lesson, try to seek for and recognize messages from the Lord. Try to recognize how He speaks to you. Principles of revelation Samuel was born to Hannah as an answer to her prayers. When Samuel was young, Hannah brought him to the tabernacle where Eli could care for him. One night, the boy Samuel had an experience hearing the voice of the Lord. Before providing the instructions below, you might explain that some principles in the scriptures are implied. This means they are not directly stated in the verses. The Holy Ghost can help us identify implied principles as we ask ourselves questions like “What might the author of these verses have wanted me to learn?” or “What are some of the important lessons these verses teach?” Study 1 Samuel 3:1–10, 19 , looking for insights and truths about receiving revelation from God. When students have finished studying, invite them to write principles they discovered on the board. Using their own words, students may have identified principles listed below. If they struggle to identify principles, you may list the following and invite them to identify phrases or verses that teach them. The Lord patiently reaches out to us even when we do not initially recognize His voice ( see verses 4, 6, 8, 10 ). The Lord speaks to youth ( see verses 4, 6, 8, 10 ). It often requires time and practice to become familiar with the Lord’s voice ( see verses 7, 10, 19 ). Others can help us recognize the voice of the Lord ( see verse 8–9 ). When we demonstrate a willingness to listen and act, the Lord will reveal more. ( see verses 10, 19 ) Why could these principles be helpful as we try to recognize the Lord’s voice in our lives? How are they a demonstration of His love for us? Recognizing the voice of the Lord The Lord speaks to us in many ways through the Holy Ghost. Learning how He might speak to you can help you better recognize His voice in your life. Provide students with the handout “ How Can I Recognize the Lord’s Voice? ” Consider doing the first row of the chart as a class before inviting students to complete the remaining rows. It might be best to invite students to complete this on their own to allow for personal reflection. If you feel you may not have enough time for this activity, consider inviting students to only do a few rows, or consider continuing the lesson on another day. Open PDF When students finish studying, take time to let them discuss what they discovered and to ask questions. Use this time to allow students to share how they hear the Lord’s voice in their lives. You might also share a personal experience and explain how you hear Him. Express gratitude to students for the things they share. Let them know that their contributions make a meaningful difference in class. Becoming familiar with the Lord’s voice Like Samuel, it might require time and practice for us to become familiar with the Lord’s voice and recognize personal revelation (see 1 Samuel 3:7, 10, 19 ). What are some ways we, like Samuel, can try to recognize the voice of the Lord? Some ideas might be talking to a parent or trusted mentor about how to receive revelation like Samuel spoke to Eli. Samuel said, “Speak; for thy servant heareth” ( 1 Samuel 3:10 ). Perhaps we can also make it clear to the Lord we are ready to hear His messages by having moments to ponder and listen after prayer or throughout the day. Or we could record in a journal some of the ways we may be receiving messages from Heavenly Father, like those in the handout. In your study journal, create a plan of something you would like to do to seek for and recognize revelation from God in your life. Testify that as students make a focused effort over time, their ability to recognize personal revelation will increase. Let students know they will be given an opportunity to reflect on their efforts to recognize personal revelation in Lesson 80: “ Assess Your Learning 5 .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 71 ---\nLike many people today, the ancient Israelites struggled with the temptation to fit in with others rather than obeying the Lord. For many years in the promised land, the Lord guided Israel through judges like Samuel. Later in Samuel’s life, the Israelites desired to have a king “like all the nations” ( 1 Samuel 8:5 ) instead of the Lord to reign over them. This lesson can help students understand the importance of choosing to follow Jesus Christ instead of worldly influences. Student preparation: Invite students to make a list of any peer pressures that they face to disobey standards and commandments of the Lord. Invite students to ponder the difference it would make in their lives to follow Jesus Christ instead of giving in to those pressures. Possible Learning Activities Decision-making To help students think about what influences their decisions, consider writing the following statement on the board. Students could complete the statement and respond to the accompanying questions as a class or in small groups. Some teenagers want to because “everybody else is doing it.” What challenges might a teenager experience if that is their reason for doing things? How could that reason for doing things affect their relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Give students an opportunity to reflect on how peer pressure may be influencing their lives. One way to do this is to give students the following instructions and display the scale. Think about what influences the decisions you make in your life. Draw the following scale in your study journal. Draw a small stick figure of yourself that represents where you would place yourself on the scale. To help students recognize what may be influencing specific decisions in their lives, they or you could provide examples of decisions they are facing. Possible examples include the way they dress, entertainment and media choices, and how they spend their time. You could share these examples one at a time and invite students to draw additional stick figures on the scale for each example. Invite students to seek the influence of the Holy Ghost as they ponder their own decisions while studying 1 Samuel 8 . A king “like all the nations” For many years in the promised land, the Lord guided the Israelites through judges like Samuel. As Samuel grew older, the elders of Israel came to him with a request. Read 1 Samuel 8:4–7 , looking for how the children of Israel might have finished the statement from the beginning of the lesson. What did the children of Israel want? Why do you think their reasons for wanting a king would displease Samuel? It may seem surprising that the Lord would tell Samuel to listen to the poor choice of his people (see verse 7 ). Heavenly Father honors agency and will not force us to choose the right. Yet, before the Israelites made their final decision, the Lord loved them enough to warn them through Samuel of the consequences of their choice (see 1 Samuel 8:9 ). One way you can help students see how the scriptures illustrate gospel truths is by writing a truth on the board. Then have students search a scripture passage, looking for evidence of that truth. Consider displaying the following truth on the board. Students could read the accompanying verses with a partner, pausing after every couple of verses to discuss what they find. Choosing to follow the world instead of the Lord’s loving counsel will lead to suffering and regret. As you study 1 Samuel 8:10–18 , look for words or phrases that help teach this truth. As students answer the following questions, remind them to not share names or specific details about individuals they personally know. Examples could come from their life, the lives of others, or from accounts in the scriptures or Church history. What examples have you seen when choosing to follow the world has led to suffering or regret? How have you seen choosing to follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ lead to joy and a stronger relationship with Them? To help students see the importance of following Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ instead of worldly influences, you could show Elder Randall K. Bennett’s October 2011 conference talk “ Choose Eternal Life ,” available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 0:00 to 2:08. Elder Bennett shares the consequences he suffered because he ignored warnings. Then you could show the same video from time code 5:08 to 6:43 as Elder Bennett teaches how his experience can apply to the currents in the world we may be tempted to follow and how we can avoid them. 10:9 10:9 Choosing the Lord instead of worldly pressures The following activity can help students discover counsel the Lord has given to protect them from giving in to temptations they may feel pressured to do or believe. You could have students work in small groups to complete steps 1 and 2. They could then complete step 3 on their own. Display the following instructions. Choose something that teenage members of the Church around you might feel pressure to do or believe. Use the scriptures, scripture study helps, For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices , or the Gospel Library app to answer the following questions about the pressure you selected: What counsel has the Lord given us about this? What blessings has the Lord promised to people who choose Him over worldly influences? Think about what you believe about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Write a couple of sentences about how this knowledge can help you follow Them instead of worldly pressures. After sufficient time, provide students an opportunity to share with others what they learned from their study. Demonstrate understanding This section is designed to give students an opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of what they have learned today. Read 1 Samuel 8:19–22 , looking for how Israel responded to the Lord’s warnings about their desire to have a king. From what you have learned today, what would you want to tell the Israelites before they made their final choice? It will be helpful for future lessons for students to know that the Lord honored the Israelites’ agency and instructed Samuel to call Saul as King of Israel (see 1 Samuel 9–10 ).\n\n\n--- Lesson 72 ---\nThough God gives commandments to guide us and bring us joy, we might be tempted to respond to His commandments the way that Saul did. God gave Saul and his army specific instructions through the prophet Samuel about their conflict with the Amalekites. Saul and his army followed some of God’s commands but felt justified disobeying others. This lesson can help students understand the importance of striving to obey all of God’s commandments. Student preparation: Invite students to think of reasons people might have for choosing to disobey God’s commandments. Students could record their list in a note on their phone or write it on a small piece of paper. Invite students to bring their lists to class. Possible Learning Activities Cafeterias Consider beginning class by contrasting situations when it is appropriate to pick what we like with situations when it is not. You could display several kinds of food or pictures of several kinds of food. Invite students to imagine all this food is available for them to eat. Which foods would you choose to eat? Which would you choose not to eat? Why? Read this statement from President Russell M. Nelson, looking for how our approach to obeying God’s commandments should differ from how we choose our food: 14:30 [Have] faith to keep all the commandments of God, knowing that they are given to bless His children and bring them joy. [You] will encounter people who pick which commandments they will keep and ignore others that they choose to break. I call this the cafeteria approach to obedience. This practice of picking and choosing will not work. It will lead to misery. To prepare to meet God, one keeps all of His commandments. It takes faith to obey them, and keeping His commandments will strengthen that faith. (“ Face the Future with Faith ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2011, 34) Invite students to summarize what President Nelson taught about keeping all of God’s commandments into a statement of truth. Using the students’ own words, help them identify a truth like striving to keep all of God’s commandments leads to joy or picking and choosing which of God’s commandments to keep leads to misery . Why might someone choose not to keep certain commandments from God? Reflect on your own approach to obeying God’s commandments by silently pondering the following questions: How do you respond when you hear a commandment or standard you might not be sure you want to keep? How important to you is striving to obey all of God’s commandments? As you study today, seek the Spirit’s help in understanding the importance of striving to obey all of God’s commandments. King Saul’s choices Consider summarizing or reading the following paragraph to help students understand the events leading up to 1 Samuel 15 . After the Lord told Samuel to let the Israelites have a king, the Lord directed Samuel to anoint a young man named Saul to be the king (see 1 Samuel 8–10 ). When threatened by an attack from the Philistines, Saul disobeyed the Lord by offering a sacrifice that he wasn’t authorized to make (see 1 Samuel 13:8–9 ). Samuel then taught Saul the consequences of his disobedience (see 1 Samuel 13:10–14 ). In Chapter 15 , we see a similar pattern when Saul doesn’t follow the Lord’s instructions with exactness. Read 1 Samuel 15:1–3, 7–9 , where the Lord gave Saul and his army specific commandments. As you read, look for which of the Lord’s commandments Saul and his army chose to obey and which they chose not to obey. You might want to remind students that we don’t know all the reasons God commanded Saul and his army to destroy the Amalekites and their animals. But we do know God is perfect and loves all of His children, and we can still learn valuable lessons from Saul’s response to God’s commandment. How might the truth taught by President Nelson have helped Saul and his army? Attitudes and justifications The following study activity can help students recognize attitudes and excuses that can lead to disobeying God. Students could complete the activity in groups or individually. After the battle with the Amalekites, Samuel spoke to Saul about his and his army’s disobedience. Read 1 Samuel 15:13–24 , looking for attitudes and excuses that influenced Saul’s choice to disobey God’s commandments. Students could write what they find on the board. They might point out that Saul: Lied about his obedience ( verses 13, 20 ). Tried to justify his disobedience ( verses 15, 21 ). Blamed others for his actions ( verses 15, 21 ). Became prideful ( verse 17 ). Didn’t prioritize what was most important ( verse 22 ). Worried more about the opinions of others than obeying God ( verse 24 ). You might invite students to compare Saul’s attitudes and justifications with the Savior’s attitudes and actions in Matthew 26:36–39 . Invite students to share what they learn about obedience from the Savior’s example. Then, consider separating students into groups. Ask them to create the following list. Make a list of some commandments that people today might choose to overlook or ignore. Ask each group to pick one of the commandments on their list. Have them create a scenario in which a teenager might be tempted to disobey the commandment by adopting some of the attitudes or justifications students identified from 1 Samuel 15 . Or you could watch “ Honesty: You Better Believe It! ” (4:46), from ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Stop the video at time code 1:27 and invite students to use the young woman’s situation as the scenario. (You could show the conclusion of the video after students answer the questions below.) 4:47 Using their scenarios, invite students to discuss the questions below with their group. How might someone in this situation be tempted to use the attitudes or justifications that Saul used? How could choices to obey or disobey this commandment eventually lead to joy or misery? What related gospel teachings could help us choose to obey God if we were in this situation? God’s love Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles helped us understand why Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ give us laws that They expect us to obey: 13:12 The love of the Father and the Son is freely given but also includes hopes and expectations. … [Q]uoting President Nelson, “God’s laws are motivated entirely by His infinite love for us and His desire for us to become all we can become.” Because They love you, They do not want to leave you “just as you are.” Because They love you, They want you to have joy and success. Because They love you, They want you to repent because that is the path to happiness. But it is your choice—They honor your agency. You must choose to love Them, to serve Them, to keep Their commandments. Then They can more abundantly bless you as well as love you. (“ The Love of God ,” Liahona , Nov. 2021, 18) What would you share from this statement with someone who feels like God’s commandments are not very important? How has keeping a specific commandment of God helped you “to have joy and success”? Choosing to obey all of God’s commandments You might want to tell students that Saul’s choices to reject God’s counsel led to God instructing Samuel to find another king to take Saul’s place (see 1 Samuel 13:14 ; 15:28 ). To help students demonstrate their understanding of the importance of obeying God’s commandments, consider displaying the following instructions. Pick one of the following activities to complete in your study journal: Imagine that you have friends who are Latter-day Saints and who are justifying breaking certain commandments. They have been pressuring you to do the same. Write what you want to remember from this lesson to help you follow God’s commandments. Fill in the blanks: I want to obey God’s commandments because . Something I want to remember from what I felt or learned today is . Consider sharing your testimony of the blessings that come from striving to obey all of God’s commandments.\n\n\n--- Lesson 73 ---\nThe Lord revealed to Samuel that He had chosen David to succeed Saul as king of Israel. Through this experience, Samuel learned that the Lord sees us differently than people usually see one another. This lesson can help students feel the importance of seeing themselves and others like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ do. Student preparation: Invite students to read 1 Samuel 16:7 . Ask them to list next to the verse differences between what others sometimes value in people and what Heavenly Father values in us. Possible Learning Activities Hidden value Consider beginning class by helping students realize that we can’t always see the worth of something by the package it is in. To do this, you might display two identical items in two different packages, or you might display items of different value in two identical packages. Before revealing the contents, invite a student to choose which package they want more. Ask them why they chose that package. Then reveal the contents of both packages. What problems can come from judging other people, or even judging ourselves, based only on what we can see? How is God’s view of us different than how we might view each other? Consider displaying the following self-reflection prompts. Ponder and complete the following prompts in your study journal: When someone first meets me, I think they are most likely to notice . I believe Heavenly Father sees the following qualities in me that many others don’t see: . When I first meet other people, I tend to notice . If I could see others as Heavenly Father does, it could help me to . As you study 1 Samuel 16 today, prayerfully invite the Holy Ghost to help you feel the importance of seeing yourself and others more like God does. The Lord sends Samuel to anoint the next king To allow all students to actively participate, consider putting students into partnerships. Invite partners to read the two passages below and to discuss the questions that follow. Before students read, ensure they know that because of Saul’s disobedience, the Lord rejected him as king of Israel (see 1 Samuel 13:13–14 ; 15:26–28 ). Read 1 Samuel 16:1–5 to see why the Lord sent Samuel to Bethlehem. If the Lord had given you Samuel’s responsibility to anoint a new king, what qualities would you have looked for in Jesse’s sons? Read verses 6–13 , looking for truths the Lord taught as Samuel tried to identify the future king. What did you learn from this account that is important for people today to understand? When partners are done sharing what they learned, invite each partnership to write one truth on the board along with the verse number where they found it. Students might write a variety of truths in their own words, such as God sees our true potential by looking at our hearts rather than our outward appearance . What have you learned from the scriptures and Church leaders about qualities the Lord values? How do you think our relationships with others would be different if we saw ourselves and each other more like the Lord sees us? Help students deepen their understanding The following options are different methods for students to deepen their understanding of what the Lord taught in 1 Samuel 16:7 . Choose the methods you feel are best for your students. Before presenting the option or options of your choice, consider helping students relate what they will study to real life. You could do this by presenting a brief situation that students could help with. For example, you could ask them to look for things they might share with someone who feels overlooked or misjudged by people around them. Or you could invite students to look for things they might share with someone who feels that the Lord doesn’t really understand them. Option 1 Consider placing students in partnerships. Have each student study a different statement. Students could then share what they learn with their partner. You might want to display or provide copies of the statements. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, said: Heavenly Father’s interest in you does not depend on how rich or beautiful or healthy or smart you are. He sees you not as the world sees you; He sees who you really are. He looks on your heart. And He loves you because you are His child. (“ Your Wonderful Journey Home ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2013, 128) Sister Michelle D. Craig, formerly of the Young Women General Presidency, explained: Jesus Christ sees people deeply. He sees individuals, their needs, and who they can become. Where others saw fishermen, sinners, or publicans, Jesus saw disciples; where others saw a man possessed by devils, Jesus looked past the outward distress, acknowledged the man, and healed him. Even in our busy lives, we can follow the example of Jesus and see individuals—their needs, their faith, their struggle, and who they can become. (“ Eyes to See ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 16) Option 2 Students could search the list of doctrinal mastery passages in the Doctrinal Mastery Core Document (2023) for passages that help them understand how God feels about us and how perfectly He knows us. Students could work in groups of four, with each student looking for applicable passages from one of the four standard works. (Examples they might share include Abraham 3:22–23 ; Jeremiah 1:4–5 ; Hebrews 12:9 ; Alma 7:11–13 ; Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–11 .) Option 3 Show students a video that helps them understand how God sees us or that shows someone else seeing others as He does. Invite students to think about and be prepared to share real-life situations when they could use what they learn from the video. The video “ Our True Identity ” (3:39), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , is one example you could use. 3:39 Personal experiences This section of the lesson can help students feel the importance of seeing themselves and others as Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ do. Remembering and sharing experiences can invite the Holy Ghost to testify of truths students are learning. It might be helpful to display the following options. Choose one of the following options and record your thoughts in your study journal. Be sure to include what you have learned about God today from the scriptures or Church leaders. Write about someone who seems to see the good in you, even if they are aware of some of your weaknesses and mistakes. How does their influence affect how you feel about yourself? How does their influence remind you of how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ see you? Write about someone you have come to love and admire as you have gotten to know them better. What do you now see in them that others might not see or that you didn’t see when you first met them? Do you feel any impressions from the Holy Ghost of how you could help them see themselves the way that you see them or the way that their Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ see them? Invite volunteers to share parts of what they recorded in their study journals.\n\n\n--- Lesson 74 ---\nWhen David went to fight Goliath, David was “but a youth,” facing Goliath, “a man of war from his youth” ( 1 Samuel 17:33 ). However, David knew the Lord would be with him, which made all the difference. Today, we can find strength in our challenges as we face them with Jesus Christ. This lesson can help students rely on the Lord as they face their challenges. Student preparation: Invite students to think of situations when a youth might need to demonstrate courage. Students could ask a family member or friend for experiences they have had that required courage. Possible Learning Activities My Goliath Before class, consider placing tape or another type of marker on the wall to visually indicate how tall Goliath might have been (approximately 9 feet 9 inches, or 3 meters). Display the picture from the beginning of the lesson. What do you know about the story of David and Goliath? Invite a few students to stand and compare their height with Goliath’s height on the wall. Encourage them to imagine what it would be like to face Goliath in one-on-one combat. Draw a large stick figure on the board that represents Goliath. Label it Our Challenges . Invite students to list challenges youth face next to the large stick figure on the board. What are some challenges—large or small—that youth face today? After students have listed several challenges on the board, invite them to draw a large stick figure in their study journal and label it My Challenge . Students could write a personal challenge next to their stick figure. Have students quietly reflect on the following: Ponder any challenges you might have in your life. Choose one to focus on today. Think about how confident you feel that the Lord can help you with this challenge. Record your thoughts in your journal. As you study 1 Samuel 17 , invite the Holy Ghost to help you know how you can invite the Savior’s help to face your challenge. Faith over fear To help your students understand the context of this story, you could share any details from the following paragraph that students might not have shared at the beginning of the lesson. Israel was at war with the Philistines. A Philistine warrior, Goliath, issued a challenge. He said that if one of the Israelites defeated him in single combat, then the Philistines would surrender and be servants to Israel. But if Goliath won, Israel would be servants to the Philistines. For 40 days Goliath came and challenged the Israelites to battle. King Saul and Israel’s army were afraid. David came to deliver food to his brothers who were soldiers in the army. He heard Goliath defy the armies of Israel (see 1 Samuel 17:1–25 ). Read 1 Samuel 17:26 , looking for how David responded when he heard Goliath defy the armies of Israel. What stands out to you about David’s response? To help students study the following verses, you could invite three willing students to read the roles of King Saul, David, and the narrator. Read 1 Samuel 17:31–37 , looking for why David was so confident in “the living God” ( verse 36 ). To help students visualize these verses, you could show the video “ David and Goliath ” from time code 0:00 to 1:20 or “ The Lord Will Deliver Me ” from time code 0:47 to 1:59. Both videos are available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 2:36 3:24 What had David learned about the Lord that gave him confidence to go against Goliath? Helping students state converting principles in their own words can deepen their understanding of the scriptures and the words of the prophets. One way to do this is by asking follow-up questions after a student has shared an explanation. The following question is an example. (For additional training on how to help students state converting principles, see “ Focus on truths that lead to conversion and build faith in Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills .) How could what David learned about the Lord help us as we face our challenges? One principle that students might state in their own words is that as we rely on the Lord, He will help us face our challenges . Relying on the Lord Read 1 Samuel 17:38–51 , looking for ways David relied on the Lord as he faced Goliath. Consider marking what you find. If students read different roles of the story, they could continue doing so for these verses. You could add another student for the part of Goliath. You could also finish one of the following videos: “ David and Goliath ” from time code 1:20 to 2:36 or “ The Lord Will Deliver Me ” from time code 1:59 to 3:23. 2:36 3:24 How did David show that he relied on the Lord? Students might respond with a variety of answers, such as when David removed the king’s armor and chose stones and a sling as a weapon ( verses 39–40 ) or when he testified of Jesus Christ ( verses 45–47 ). Ask students to explain how each action demonstrated how David relied on the Lord. Facing our challenges Consider displaying five stones or drawing five stones on the board (see 1 Samuel 17:40 ). These stones can represent ways that we can rely on the Lord as we face our challenges. Consider organizing students into pairs or small groups to follow the instructions below. They could list their answers on the board next to the stones. Choose one of the challenges listed on the board under Our Challenges . Identify five ways, specific to the challenge you chose, that an individual could rely on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as they face this challenge. Discuss why you chose each action. Invite willing students to share what they discussed. How have Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ helped you or someone you know face a challenge? What actions did you or that person take to receive Their help? Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles testified how Jesus Christ can help us as we face challenges: 14:11 If the Savior were standing here today, He would express His endless love for you, His complete confidence in you. He would tell you that you can do this. You can build a joyful, happy life because Jesus Christ is your strength. (“ Jesus Christ Is the Strength of Youth ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 12) What do you know about Jesus Christ that can help face your challenges with greater confidence in Him? Facing our personal Goliath Display the following instructions. Reflect on the personal challenge you wrote about earlier in your journal. Seek impressions from the Holy Ghost to help you choose at least one way you can rely on the Lord to face that challenge. Draw one or more stones in your study journal. Write what you will do and how you will do it next to or inside the stones. Invite willing students to share. Testify of the Savior’s ability and desire to help the students with their challenges. Express your confidence in your students’ ability to face their challenges with Jesus Christ.\n\n\n--- Lesson 75 ---\nThroughout our lives, other people will likely hurt or offend us. David was insulted by a man named Nabal. As a type of Jesus Christ, Nabal’s wife, Abigail, interceded and helped David to forgive. We can learn more about Jesus Christ and the help He gives us by comparing Abigail to Him. This lesson can help students understand how Jesus Christ can help them forgive others. Student preparation: Invite students to read, watch, or listen to “ Beauty for Ashes: The Healing Path of Forgiveness ” by Sister Kristin M. Yee ( Liahona , Nov. 2022, 36–38). They could study the entire address or portions that you have preselected. Invite students to come to class prepared to share insights that they gain about receiving the Savior’s help to forgive others. Possible Learning Activities The Atonement of Jesus Christ Consider displaying an image of Jesus Christ, such as the one at the beginning of this lesson. Write the following incomplete statement on the board. Invite students to use their study journals to list several ways they could complete it. You could play reverent music while students reflect and write. Because of Jesus Christ, I can … After sufficient time, invite willing students to share how they completed the statement. They could also express their feelings or beliefs about what they share. Display the following statement to support or add to the lists students created. President Russell M. Nelson described something we can all do because of Jesus Christ: 15:3 Through [the Savior’s] infinite Atonement, you can forgive those who have hurt you and who may never accept responsibility for their cruelty to you. It is usually easy to forgive one who sincerely and humbly seeks your forgiveness. But the Savior will grant you the ability to forgive anyone who has mistreated you in any way. Then their hurtful acts can no longer canker your soul. (“ Four Gifts That Jesus Christ Offers to You ” [First Presidency Christmas devotional, Dec. 2, 2018], Gospel Library) What does Jesus Christ make possible through His Atonement? Complete the statement on the board with the following truth: Because of Jesus Christ, I can forgive people who have hurt me. You could invite students to add this truth to their journals if it was not part of their initial list. David and Nabal 1 Samuel 25 contains an account in which the actions of Nabal’s wife, Abigail, can be compared to Jesus Christ. This comparison helps us learn more about Him. These kinds of comparisons are sometimes called types of Jesus Christ. Encourage students to invite the Holy Ghost to help them understand the type of Christ in this chapter. It might be helpful to summarize the entire account before students begin to study so they can better focus on looking for what this account teaches about Christ. As David and his men traveled in the wilderness, they met servants of a man named Nabal. During times of battle, weary soldiers often broke the law to get what they needed. David and his men needed help and support. Nabal was a wealthy man and had many flocks and herds. Rather than treating the servants of Nabal harshly and taking what they needed, David and his soldiers were kind to these servants and did not take anything from them (see 1 Samuel 25:7, 15–16 ). David sent 10 of his servants to peacefully ask Nabal for much-needed food and supplies (see 1 Samuel 25:5–9 ). Nabal insulted David and refused to help him and his army (see 1 Samuel 25:10–11 ). Under the completed statement on the board, you could draw two faces. Label one David and the other Nabal . Leave space to draw a third face between the two later in the lesson. Under the face representing David, you could write: Kind to Nabal’s servants ; Sought help from Nabal . Under the face representing Nabal, you could write: Insulted David ; Refused to help . You could invite students to change the emotions of the faces as they read the verses below. Invite half the class to read about Nabal and the other half to read about David. If needed, direct students to the footnotes for better understanding. Read 1 Samuel 25:3, 14, 17, 25 , looking for characteristics of Nabal. Read 1 Samuel 25:13, 21–22 , looking for David’s reaction to Nabal’s insults and refusal to help. Ask a volunteer from each group to write on the board what they learned about their assigned person. For example, under Nabal they could write Rude ; Wicked ; Insensitive . Under David they could write Angry ; Felt mistreated ; Sought revenge . Students could change the emotions on each face to reflect what they learned. Give students a chance to think about their own circumstances. Assure them that they will not be sharing their answers to this self-assessment. Ponder your answers to the following questions: When has someone else mistreated you? What efforts, success, or struggles have you made or had forgiving this person for their mistreatment? Abigail as a type of Christ Prepare students to study about Abigail by introducing the study skill of finding types of Christ. Explain that students can look for things that Abigail says or does that remind them of Jesus Christ, His roles, and His mission in Heavenly Father’s plan. A servant of Nabal witnessed the conflict between his master and David. The servant informed Abigail, Nabal’s wife (see 1 Samuel 25:14–17 ). When Abigail learned of this conflict, she interceded on Nabal’s behalf and asked David to forgive him (see 1 Samuel 25:18–20, 23–28 ). Abigail can be seen as a type of Christ. We can find types of Christ as we study the scriptures and look for how individuals, objects, or even events help us to think of Christ. On the board, draw a face between David and Nabal. Label this face Abigail . Give students sufficient time to study the following individually or in small groups. Read 1 Samuel 25:18–19, 23–28, 31 , looking for anything that Abigail said or did that is similar to something that Jesus Christ has said or done. Consider marking what you find. Under the face representing Abigail, make a list of things students found. Possible answers could be: Provided abundant support ( verse 18 ); Took the mistakes of Nabal upon herself ( verse 24 ); Asked David to forgive her for Nabal’s mistakes ( verse 28 ); Worked to remove grief and offense from David’s heart ( verse 31 ). How is Abigail a type of Jesus Christ? Sister Kristin M. Yee of the Relief Society General Presidency shared insights into the Savior’s ability to help us forgive. In this account, Abigail can be seen as a powerful type or symbol of Jesus Christ. Through His atoning sacrifice, He can release us from the sin and weight of a warring heart and provide us with the sustenance we need. Just as Abigail was willing to take Nabal’s sin upon herself, so did the Savior—in an incomprehensible way—take upon Him our sins and the sins of those who have hurt or offended us. … Abigail’s bringing an abundance of food and supplies can teach us that the Savior offers to those who have been hurt and injured the sustenance and help we need to be healed and made whole. … Just as Abigail helped David not to have an “offence of heart” [ 1 Samuel 25:31 ] and to receive the help he needed, so will the Savior help you. (“ Beauty for Ashes: The Healing Path of Forgiveness ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 36–37) Invite students to share what is meaningful to them from Sister Yee’s statement. As students share, you could replace the face that represents Abigail with the image of Jesus Christ you displayed earlier in the lesson, putting the image of the Savior between the faces of Nabal and David. How does the Savior help us forgive others? Read 1 Samuel 25:32–35 , looking for how Abigail’s actions affected David. How might we feel similarly when we receive the Savior’s help to forgive others? Demonstrate understanding Give students an opportunity to express what they understand about the Savior’s ability to help them forgive others. The following is one way you could do this. Complete the following in your study journal: Draw a face that represents your feelings when someone hurts or offends you. Next to that image, draw a face that represents a person who might have hurt you. Between the two drawings, make a list of what you understand about the Savior that can help you forgive others. Consider inviting students to share what they wrote about the Savior. You might also encourage them to share what they have learned with others outside the class. Add your witness of the help the Savior offers us as we strive to forgive others.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 77 ---\nWith the Lord by his side, David defeated Goliath, conquered in battle, and became king of Israel. However, in his lustful pursuit of Bathsheba, David turned away from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and fell from his exaltation (see Doctrine and Covenants 132:39 ). This lesson can help students recognize that they cannot hide their sins from the Lord, but they can turn to Him to overcome temptation. Student preparation: Invite students to make a list of some of the lies Satan uses to tempt us to sin (for example, students could review 2 Nephi 28:6–9, 20–22 ). Then invite them to ponder how truths taught in the gospel of Jesus Christ help us turn to the Lord when we face temptation. Possible Learning Activities Decisions that turn us toward or away from the Lord Display a picture of the Savior with arrows going toward and away from the image. Invite students to answer the following questions. Students could write their answers under the appropriate arrows on the board. What are some things the Lord invites us to do to turn to Him? What lies might Satan use to convince us to turn away from the Lord? Students might share a variety of phrases such as these: “It’s not a big deal”; “You can repent later”; and “I’m not hurting anyone.” If students do not mention it, write No one will know on the board. The following paragraph is an invitation for students to involve the Spirit as they consider thoughts they have when they make mistakes. Take a moment to invite the Holy Ghost to help you recognize thoughts or actions in your life that turn you toward or away from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. As you study, look for impressions of the Spirit that can help you choose to turn to Them. David’s decisions to turn from the Lord Invite students to recall the stories they have studied that showed that the Lord was guiding and directing David. You could share that the story they will study today demonstrates what happened when David made a series of decisions that turned him away from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. As a student reads each verse of the following passage, others in the class could hold up the word Stop or gesture when they see David making a decision that turned him away from the Lord. Each time they stop, students could discuss the question below. Carefully read 2 Samuel 11:1–5 , looking for the decisions David made that led him in the wrong direction. What decisions did you discover? Invite students to create a list on the board of the decisions David made in these verses and to mark them in their scriptures. The left column of the chart in this lesson includes examples of what students might find. We all face temptations that we need to resist. Knowing this, the Lord gave a powerful reassurance in 1 Corinthians 10:13 . Read this verse looking for the help the Lord has promised us. What did you discover? The following activity is one way to help students see that even with temptations like those David faced, the Lord has provided teachings that can help us avoid temptation and escape sin. You could display the following instructions for students to follow in small groups or individually. Depending on the abilities of your students, you may want to display the scriptures in the second column and adjust the second step to have students read the scripture or scriptures instead of finding them. Complete the following instructions: Select one or more of the decisions David made that led him away from the Lord. Find a scripture that includes or illustrates one of the Savior’s teachings that can help us avoid temptation and escape a similar choice. Prepare to share what you found. David’s decision Teachings of the Savior and His prophets David’s decision 2 Samuel 11:1 —David remained in Jerusalem when kings went to the battlefield with their army. Teachings of the Savior and His prophets Alma 7:22 ; Doctrine and Covenants 42:42 David’s decision 2 Samuel 11:2 —David saw Bathsheba washing herself and continued to look upon her. Teachings of the Savior and His prophets Mosiah 4:30 ; 3 Nephi 12:28–29 David’s decision 2 Samuel 11:3 —David pursued her. Teachings of the Savior and His prophets Doctrine and Covenants 63:16 David’s decision 2 Samuel 11:4 —Knowing Bathsheba was married, David had her brought to his palace. Teachings of the Savior and His prophets Genesis 39:9 David’s decision 2 Samuel 11:4 —David broke the law of chastity. Teachings of the Savior and His prophets Doctrine and Covenants 42:23–25 What stood out to you? What did you learn about the Lord from this study activity? To summarize 2 Samuel 11:6–13 , you could explain that when he found out Bathsheba was pregnant, David summoned her husband, Uriah, home from battle. David commanded Uriah to spend the night with Bathsheba so it would appear that Uriah was responsible for her pregnancy. Read 2 Samuel 11:14–17, 26–27 , looking for what David did when his plan to hide his adultery was unsuccessful. What thoughts or feelings did you have as you read these verses? Refer to the list of David’s decisions on the board and add David tried to hide his sins . Explain to students that after the death of Uriah, the Lord sent His prophet Nathan to King David. As they read the following parable, students could illustrate the story on the board or in their study journals. Read 2 Samuel 12:1–10 , looking for what Nathan said to David. What stands out to you from this parable? What truths might someone learn from David’s story? In addition to other truths students might identify, emphasize that we cannot hide our sins from God. You might invite students to cross–reference or link 2 Samuel 12:7–9 with 2 Nephi 9:20 and Alma 39:8 . How is it a blessing that we cannot hide our sins from our loving Heavenly Father? How might understanding this truth help us turn to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and repent? If needed, you could refer to Doctrine and Covenants 132:39 , sharing that having Uriah killed was David’s final attempt to hide his sins. With this decision, David lost his exaltation. Reassure students that the Lord still loved David, but there were blessings David could not receive as a consequence of his decisions. We can turn back to the Lord Invite students to quietly ponder what they learned and felt from David’s story. Help students understand that because Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ know us perfectly, They understand our circumstances, why we made the choices we did, and how to help us turn back to Them. Some students may feel discouraged by the mistakes they have made. To help them focus on the Lord’s desire to forgive, you could show the video “ The Savior Wants to Forgive ” (5:50) or “ I Stand All Amazed ” (5:15). Both are available from ChurchofJesusChrist.org. 5:50 5:16 Share what you have learned To help students share their understanding of the truths taught, consider using the image from the beginning of class. You could invite students to draw something similar in their study journals. Then display the following instructions for students to complete. In your study journal, select one of the decisions David made or a temptation a teenager might face today. Imagine you were giving counsel to someone thinking about making that decision. Choose at least two options from the following list to share what you have learned. A summary of what you have learned today about not hiding sins and instead, turning to the Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. A scripture passage that illustrates what the Savior and His prophets have taught about overcoming the temptation you selected. An experience you or someone you know has had that has helped you turn to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ when you face temptation. A brief testimony of the Savior’s power to help us overcome temptation and repent when we sin. Consider concluding class with your witness that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ know and love the students perfectly. You could reassure students that no matter what struggles we face, Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love us and are eager to help us repent.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 78 ---\nHave you ever considered how the blessings you receive from Heavenly Father help you accomplish His work? After the death of David, his father, Solomon was appointed by the Lord to be the new king of Israel. Wanting to honor the Lord, Solomon humbly sought blessings that would increase his ability to serve the Lord and the Israelites righteously. This lesson can help students understand that the Lord will bless us with the ability to accomplish His work. Student preparation: Invite students to write down something they are trying to do to participate in the work of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Invite students to prayerfully ask Heavenly Father what blessings they need to help Him accomplish His work Possible Learning Activities Humbly recognizing our weaknesses To begin class, draw an image like the following on the board. Students could copy the drawing in their study journals. Then invite students to discuss the following questions: What are some ways the Savior has invited us to participate in His work? What are some ways a teenager might feel inadequate to serve the Lord? Consider inviting students to list, in the gap between the images, some ways a teenager might feel inadequate. Students might identify worries, such as anxiety, shyness, feeling overwhelmed or not qualified. Then invite students to ponder the following questions. Think about a few of the invitations the Lord has given you to participate in His work. What concerns do you have about your ability to accomplish His invitations? How confident do you feel in the Lord’s ability to help you overcome concerns you have? As you study today, invite the Holy Ghost to help you understand how the Lord will help you accomplish His work. King Solomon desires to reign righteously Share with students that when King David died, his son Solomon was chosen by the Lord to reign as king of Israel (see 1 Kings 1:11–13 ). Solomon loved the Lord and desired to be a righteous king (see 1 Kings 3:3 ). You could change the label of the stick figure on the board to Solomon and change the other side to Be a righteous king . How might a righteous king have been expected to act? How might Solomon have felt replacing his father as king? Consider displaying the following scripture passages and questions. You could organize students into partnerships. Have one partner read 1 Kings 3:5–9 and the other read 1 Kings 3:10–14 , then share their answers with each other. Read 1 Kings 3:5–9 , looking for blessings Solomon requested of the Lord. What impresses you about Solomon’s request? What Christlike attributes does Solomon demonstrate? Read 1 Kings 3:10–14 , looking for blessings the Lord promised Solomon. How could a “wise and understanding heart” ( verse 12 ) and “riches and honor” ( verse 13 ) increase Solomon’s ability to serve the Lord righteously? What did the Lord require of Solomon to qualify for these blessings? ( verse 14 ). Summarize Solomon’s experience with the Lord as a statement of truth. Students might identify a truth such as: As we humbly recognize our weakness and seek the Lord’s help to bless others, He will increase our ability to accomplish His work. It might be helpful to write this truth on the board and invite students to mark the phrases that teach this truth. Read the following statement from President Thomas S. Monson (1927–2018), looking for the promise given to all who are willing to participate in the Lord’s work. Now, some of you may be shy by nature or consider yourselves inadequate to respond affirmatively to [the Lord]. Remember that this work is not yours and mine alone. It is the Lord’s work, and when we are on the Lord’s errand, we are entitled to the Lord’s help. Remember that the Lord will shape the back to bear the burden placed upon it. (“ To Learn, to Do, to Be ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2008, 62) How might President Monson’s teachings help someone who was worried about their ability to serve the Lord? You could draw a bridge between each side of the image on the board and label it The Lord’s help . Invite students to draw something similar in their study journals. The Lord increases our ability to serve Him You might want to help students deepen their understanding of this truth. One way to do this would be to use the handout “Participate in the Work of the Lord.” You could cut the handout in half and invite students to select the section that focuses on the part of the truth they would like to learn more about. Students could work individually or with two or three others who selected the same section. Open PDF After the study activity, invite students to respond to the following invitation. Refer to the drawing in your study journal from the beginning of class. Prayerfully write down one or two weaknesses you feel could be keeping you from better serving Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Invite the Holy Ghost to help you recognize blessings you could seek from the Lord that could help you overcome these weaknesses. Demonstrate understanding Provide an opportunity for students to share what they have learned. This can invite the Holy Ghost to testify that what they are sharing is true. The following activity is one way to help students do this. Imagine a friend shares her anxiety about receiving a new calling in your ward or branch. From what you studied today, what would you share that could help your friend? You might invite volunteers to share with the class. Consider encouraging students to take their handout home and share what they learned with a family member or friend. You could testify of the Lord’s power and willingness to bless us with what we need to faithfully labor with Him in this great work.\n\n\n--- Lesson 79 ---\nIn our day, the temple is becoming more accessible around the world, but it has not always been that way. With the construction of Solomon’s temple, the Israelites finally had a permanent house of the Lord, a place where the Savior Himself would “dwell among the children of Israel” ( 1 Kings 6:13 ). The Savior’s promise is also being fulfilled in our day as temples dot the earth. This lesson can help students deepen their understanding that the temple is the house of the Lord. Student preparation: Invite students to bring a picture of a nearby or favorite temple. They could prepare to share why the temple is meaningful to them. Possible Learning Activities The temple is the house of the Lord To begin class, invite students to respond to the following scenario (or something similar that fits the needs of your class). Imagine your friend Angela sees a picture of a new temple being built in your area and asks: Why does your Church build temples? How is a temple different from your other church buildings? Consider asking students to consider how confident they feel about answering Angela’s questions. You might invite a couple of students to share how they feel. After the dedication of the Praia Cape Verde Temple, Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught: The temple is literally the house of the Lord. Let those words sink gently into your soul. It is His house. (“ The House of the Lord—Recent Messages from Prophets, Apostles, and Other Church Leaders ”, newsroom.ChurchofJesusChrist.org , Aug. 13, 2023) Invite students to write this truth in their study journals and on the board: The temple is the house of the Lord . Take a moment to follow Elder Andersen’s invitation to let this truth sink gently into your soul as you respond to the following question in your study journal. What does it mean to you that the temple is the house of the Lord? As you study today, invite the Holy Ghost to help deepen your understanding of the temple as the Lord’s house. Throughout the lesson, add what you are learning to your study journal. It might be helpful to reassure students that although their specific questions about the temple may not be answered today, the Holy Ghost will continue to inspire and direct their efforts to learn more about the Lord’s house. The Lord commands His people to build His house At Mount Sinai, the Lord commanded the people to build a portable, temporary tabernacle to bless the children of Israel (see Exodus 25:1–8 ). Many generations later, at the time of King Solomon, a permanent temple still had not been built. To help students see similarities in the Lord’s command to build His house at the time of 1 Kings 6–9 and in our day, you could display images of Solomon’s temple and the nearest modern-day temple. One way to help students see these similarities between temples anciently and in our day would be to display the following chart. There are three suggested chart activities in the lesson. You might consider some variety in how students will study each chart. For this first chart activity, consider inviting half the class to study the verses in the “Solomon’s Day” column and the other half to study the verses in the “Our Day” column. After studying the verses, students could share what they found with a partner who studied the verses from the opposite column. Another way to organize the activity would be to divide students into three groups and give each group a chart. Students could study together and select a spokesperson to present their group’s section to the class. At the end of the presentation, each group could share how the topics they studied could help answer Angela’s questions. As you study the following verses, look for teachings that could help you explain the Lord’s promises for temples anciently and today. Add what you find to your study journal entry. Solomon’s Day Our Day Solomon’s Day 2 Samuel 7:4–6 1 Chronicles 22:5–11 1 Kings 5:5 ; 6:1 Our Day Doctrine and Covenants 88:119–120 Doctrine and Covenants 97:10–16 What did you learn about the importance of temples today? To help students reflect on how we continue to follow the Savior’s instruction to build temples today, consider showing a video of the current prophet announcing new temples during general conference. Alternatively, you could share some of the latest temple statistics, available at Temple List at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Temples are dedicated to the Lord as His house After seven years of construction, Solomon’s temple was finished and dedicated. To help students understand that temple dedicatory prayers are received by revelation and preserved in the records of the Church, consider sharing an example of a dedicatory prayer with the class. The dedicatory prayer for each operating temple can be found by selecting the temple from Temple List at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . For this chart activity, you could display the verses and invite students to study the opposite half of the chart they studied previously and share with a partner who studied the other half. A discussion question is provided to help students share what they discover. Read the following passages from the dedicatory prayers of Solomon’s Temple and the Kirtland Temple looking for the blessings Solomon and the Prophet Joseph Smith sought from the Lord. Solomon’s Day Our Day Solomon’s Day 1 Kings 8:29–30, 35–40 Our Day Doctrine and Covenants 109:10–18 What could similar blessings look like today as we prepare for and worship in the house of the Lord? You could explain that following the dedication of the house of the Lord, the people experienced remarkable manifestations of His power. This chart could be a reverent moment for students to study individually, as appropriate. As you read the following passages, invite the Holy Ghost to help you imagine what it might have felt like to witness these events. Solomon’s Day Our Day Solomon’s Day 1 Kings 9:1–3 2 Chronicles 7:1–3 Our Day Doctrine and Covenants 110:2–10 What experiences have you or someone you know had participating in a temple dedication? How have you felt the Savior’s power from having His house on the earth today? It might be appropriate to explain that since the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, the hymn “ The Spirit of God ” has been sung at every temple dedication around the world. Students could sing or listen to this hymn, looking for what we learn about the Lord and His house. You might watch a video of a choir or group singing such as “ The Spirit of God ” (5:32) from ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 5:32 Demonstrate understanding To help students demonstrate understanding, you could display Angela’s questions from the beginning of the lesson. Think about how the lessons you learned today could help someone like Angela better understand the purpose of temples. Answer the questions with a partner or in your study journal. Why does your church build temples? How is a temple different from your other church buildings? Invite students to practice teaching a partner what they have learned from their study of Solomon’s temple and temples today. The student preparation for this lesson suggested that students might bring a picture of a nearby or favorite temple to class. If students brought a picture, you could invite them to show it to the class and share why that temple is meaningful to them. You could share your feelings about the Savior and His house at the conclusion of class.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 81 ---\nOur loving Father in Heaven and His son, Jesus Christ, often give us opportunities to exercise faith in Them amid life’s difficulties. In the middle of a drought, the prophet Elijah asked a widow in Zarephath to give him the last of her food. As the widow acted in faith, the Lord promised her great blessings. Like the widow, we can demonstrate our faith in God by following His prophets. This lesson can help students act with greater faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ by following the words of prophets. Student preparation: Invite students to identify something the Lord has invited us to do through His prophet and a promise He has given if we do it. Invite students to come to class ready to share. Possible Learning Activities Prophetic invitations To help students see how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ provide guidance to us through Their prophets, you could display the following activity. Consider including the current prophet and an invitation he has recently given. Alternatively, students could name several prophets (including the current prophet) and list at least one invitation the Lord has given us through each prophet. Match the prophets with an invitation the Lord gave to their people: Brother of Jared Moses Lehi Brigham Young Leave Jerusalem and depart into the wilderness. Journey to the Rocky Mountains. Build barges to cross the ocean to the promised land. Walk through the Red Sea on dry ground. Answers: 1–C (see Ether 2:16 ; 6:4, 12 ); 2–D (see Exodus 14:21–22 ); 3–A (see 1 Nephi 2:1–2 ); 4–B (see Doctrine and Covenants 136:1 ). You might invite students to ponder whether they would have followed this prophetic direction if they were alive in the days of those prophets. Invite students to reflect on their responses to the living prophet’s invitations by doing the following. On a scale of 1–10, how you would rate yourself on each of the following statements: I believe the Lord speaks through prophets. I am familiar with what the Lord is teaching through His prophets today. I am following the Lord’s teachings that are given through His prophets. As you study 1 Kings 17 , pay attention to thoughts and insights from the Holy Ghost. Think about how your study today can affect your feelings about these statements. Elijah and the widow of Zarephath The following two paragraphs could be read or summarized. Because of wickedness, the kingdom of Israel was divided into two kingdoms: Israel and Judah (see 1 Kings 11–12 ). During the reign of wicked King Ahab, the Lord sent His prophet Elijah to the people of Israel. Using the power of God, Elijah prevented rain from coming upon the land, which resulted in years of drought. The Lord provided for Elijah’s needs, instructing him to hide by a brook of water where ravens fed him (see 1 Kings 17:1–6 ). One way students can feel the power of what they read in the scriptures is to imagine themselves in similar situations. Invite students to read the following verses and answer the questions through the viewpoint of Elijah or the widow. Be sure to explain that one way the Savior communicates His words to us is through His prophets and that Elijah’s words in this account came from the Lord. Students could be placed in pairs, with each partner reading the story through a different viewpoint. Students could then use the accompanying questions to interview their partner about what they learned from their viewpoint. Alternatively, you might watch “ Elijah and the Widow of Zarephath ,” available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 4:09 to 10:06, and follow along in the verses. 10:13 Read 1 Kings 17:8–16 . How did Elijah or the widow show faith in Jesus Christ? How was the Lord’s promise fulfilled? How can both Elijah and the widow be symbolic of Jesus Christ? Invite students to share their answers. One of the ways Elijah may remind students of Jesus Christ is by inviting the widow to follow what he said to be saved. He also promised her that food would be multiplied ( 1 Kings 17:14–16 ), like the Savior promised for others (see Matthew 14:15–21 ). One of the ways the widow may remind students of Jesus Christ is by the way she was willing to sacrifice all she had, like the Savior did. Ask what lessons students learned from this account. They may share various principles. If they do not mention the following truth, be sure to add it: Acting in faith on the Savior’s words brings His promised blessings . This includes the Savior’s words through His prophets. What can make it difficult to act in faith on the Savior’s teachings? What do you know about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that can help you act in faith? The Savior’s words through His prophets Invite students to share where the Lord’s words given through His prophets can be found. In addition to scriptures and general conference, students may share places such as Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines, For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices , and social media. Invite students to use any of these sources to complete the following activity. Consider displaying the instructions and giving students a specific amount of time to study. Draw two columns in your study journal. Draw a loaf of bread to represent the widow’s cake in the left column and a cruse of oil and barrel of meal (see 1 Kings 17:12, 16 ) in the right column. Label the left column What Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ Ask . Label the right column Their Promised Blessings . In the left column, make a list of things Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are asking us to do through Their prophets. In the right column, list the promised blessings of obeying Their words. It may be helpful to provide an example for students. You could offer “living the Word of Wisdom” for the left column. Students could then read Doctrine and Covenants 89:18–21 for the blessings the Lord promises. Alternatively, you could share a recent example from the prophet’s words in general conference. Invite students to share what they wrote in their columns in small groups. Ensure that each student has an opportunity to share at least one thing from each column. Groups could then discuss the following question. How have you seen the blessings of exercising faith in the Lord’s words given through His prophets? Consider inviting students to share examples from their life of when they have seen blessings from following prophetic counsel. As part of this discussion, you might show “ That Night My Family Had Sufficient ” (1:47) or “ Fathers and Sons ” (5:42), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 1:47 6:2 Plan to follow God’s prophets Encourage students to seek the help of the Holy Ghost as they do the following activity. In the left column, write down or circle something the Lord is asking you to do through His prophets that you feel He would like you to focus on. In the right column, write down or circle how the Lord has promised to bless you if you follow His counsel. Reflect on what you wrote or circled, then write your plan to be obedient to what the Lord has asked you to do through His prophet. Invite students to find a way to remember what they plan to do. For example, students could take a picture of their response and use it as wallpaper on their phone. Students will have an opportunity to follow up and report on their plan in Lesson 96: “ Assess Your Learning 6 .” Consider concluding class by testifying that students will come closer to Jesus Christ through their efforts to follow His prophet.\n\n\n--- Lesson 82 ---\nHow committed are you to following God? To demonstrate that the God of Israel was the only true God, Elijah challenged the priests of Baal to a contest. The Lord answered Elijah’s prayers and prevailed in the contest. This lesson can help students feel a greater desire to follow the Lord. Student preparation: Invite students to think of one or more times in their lives when they knew Heavenly Father or Jesus Christ was real, or when they felt Their power in their life. Or they could think of what they could do to find out whether Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are real and if they should completely follow Them. Possible Learning Activities Can we follow two influences at the same time? Using tape or some other resource, make two lines on the floor in opposite directions as shown below. Ask a student to stand in the middle where the ends of the lines are close together and to place one foot on each line. Ask the student to take a few steps, trying to walk both lines. Ask them how long they feel they could be successful. If necessary, point out that though it is possible that someone could walk both lines for a short distance, they would not be successful for long, nor would they walk either line well. Invite the student to return to their seat. For this lesson, one line could represent the ways of the Lord, and the other could represent other influences that that do not align with the ways of the Lord. What are some ways we may try to follow the Lord and other influences at the same time? Elijah challenges the priests of Baal to a contest Summarize the paragraph below, or if you feel it would be appropriate for your students, show “ Elijah and the Priests of Baal ” (2:16), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 0:07 to 0:33. 2:17 In 1 Kings 18 , Elijah wanted the kingdom of Israel to fully commit to the Lord. It had been about three years since Elijah used his sealing power to bring a drought upon the land (see 1 Kings 17:1 ). But Israel continued worshiping false gods, including Baal (see 1 Kings 18:18 ). Elijah challenged the hundreds of false prophets of Baal and prophets of the grove to a contest on Mount Carmel to prove whether Baal or Jehovah was the true God (see 1 Kings 18:19 ). Before the contest began, Elijah spoke to the people. Read 1 Kings 18:21 , looking for Elijah’s words to the people. The word halt in this case means to hesitate or waver. What did Elijah ask the people to do? Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles rephrased Elijah’s statement this way: Today Elijah might say: Either God, our Heavenly Father, exists, or He does not, but if He exists, worship Him. Either Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the resurrected Redeemer of mankind, or He is not, but if He is, follow Him. (“ Firm and Steadfast in the Faith of Christ ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 30) What stands out to you from Elijah’s and Elder Christofferson’s statements? Invite students to share their thoughts. Some truths we can learn are: The Lord allows us to choose whether we will follow Him or the false gods and unrighteous ways of the world. When we know that Heavenly Father exists and Jesus is the Christ, we should commit to follow Them. Answer the following questions in your study journal: How strongly do I believe that I have a Father in Heaven and a Savior? How committed am I to following Them? What might keep me from committing to follow Them completely? As you continue your study, seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to help you know how you might overcome any obstacles that may prevent you from fully following Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The contest between Baal and Jehovah Read 1 Kings 18:23–24 , looking for the conditions of the contest between Elijah and the false prophets of Baal. The priests of Baal tried first, calling upon their false god for hours. Read 1 Kings 18:26–29 , looking for what happened. What did you find? If students struggle to understand these verses, consider showing “ Elijah and the Priests of Baal ” from time code 0:33 to 1:19. 2:17 For the following activity, consider giving students a time limit of around five minutes to read the verses and complete the following instructions. Emphasize that the drawing does not need to be elaborate. To learn what happened when Elijah called upon God, read 1 Kings 18:30–39 . Then, take a piece of paper and divide it in half. On one half of the paper, draw a picture of what happened when Elijah prepared his sacrifice and called upon God. What would you think and feel if you were there? How might it affect your testimony of the Lord and your willingness to follow Him? For the following activity, consider giving students a time limit of about five minutes. If it would be useful to show an example of someone who came to know God was real or what they did to come to know, consider showing one of the following videos, available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . “ His Grace: Choosing to Believe in God ” (4:07) 4:7 “ Faith Crisis: What Do We Do When We Feel Nothing? ” (5:55) 5:55 On the other half of your paper, write about or draw a picture of one or more times in your life when you knew Heavenly Father or Jesus Christ was real, or when you felt Their power in your life. Or you could write about or draw a picture of what you could do to find out if They are real and if you should completely follow Them. When the students have finished, consider giving multiple volunteers time to share what they drew or wrote if it is not too personal. Encouraging many students to share can give various perspectives and help other students realize how the truths they are learning can affect them. It might also be beneficial to ask questions such as the ones below. How does reflecting on your own experiences of seeing the power of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in your life help you in your commitment to worship and follow Them? Why do you think Heavenly Father and the Savior Jesus Christ are worth following completely? Observe Christlike attributes in students and share what you’ve noticed. You can help motivate students to continue to strive to come closer to the Lord when you point out ways they have been improving or making good choices. For this lesson, consider pointing out ways you have noticed students choosing to follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. This might include complimenting them on the choice to attend seminary, study the Lord’s word, and seek to come closer to Him. This could also include Christlike attributes you have noticed in students. To learn more on this, see “ Help learners intentionally strive to be more like Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills . To end this lesson, write in your study journal how you feel about following Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ completely. Seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to help you remember and express your feelings. You could include what you would like to do or remember because of this lesson. Share your testimony of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and the blessings of completely following Them.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 83 ---\nWhen we accept callings in the Lord’s Church, we receive His authority to serve. When we strive to diligently serve and become more like Him, He will bless us with His power. The account of the Lord blessing the prophet Elisha with power and authority after taking Elijah into heaven illustrates this truth. This lesson can help students understand that the Lord gives authority to the people He calls and power to those who serve righteously. Student preparation: Invite students to think about a time when they or someone they know has served in a Church calling. Invite students to ponder the question, “When have I witnessed the Lord’s power and authority in fulfilling Church callings?” Possible Learning Activities The source of power and authority Consider beginning class by discussing where authority to do certain things comes from. You might do this by showing an image of a doctor wearing a medical coat or in a medical setting (or another professional with authority to act in their position) and asking the following questions. What are some of this person’s responsibilities? Who gave them authority to fulfill their role? What gives you confidence to trust them? Consider showing an image of the current prophet and asking the previous questions again about him. To help students assess what they understand about serving with the Lord’s power and authority in callings, you could invite them to do the following. In your study journal or Notes section in Gospel Library, answer the following questions. As you consider your answers, listen for impressions from the Holy Ghost about what the Lord wants you to understand about serving with the Lord’s power and authority in callings. What do I understand about receiving the Lord’s power and authority to serve in callings? How could this understanding influence how I respond when I or someone else receives a calling from the Lord? Elisha receives God’s power and authority You might explain that the Lord revealed to Elijah that Elisha would become a prophet (see 1 Kings 19:16, 19 ). What concerns might Elisha have felt as he prepared for his calling from the Lord? Elisha knew that the Lord would soon take Elijah away ( 2 Kings 2:1–3 ). On Elijah’s final day, Elisha followed Elijah from city to city until the two arrived at the Jordan River. To help students discover what happened at the Jordan River, you could organize the class into small groups. On the board, you could draw the four images below or summarize each in a few words in random order. Invite each group to read 2 Kings 2:8–15 and organize the images or summary of the events in chronological order. You might need to explain that a mantle is a cloak. How did the Lord show Elisha and others that He had given Elisha power and authority in his calling? You might explain that the mantle used by Elijah and Elisha did not give them power and authority but represented God’s power and authority. In the Church today, we sometimes refer to someone’s calling or authority as their “mantle.” For example, when a new prophet is sustained as President of the Church, he receives the mantle of authority. It also might be helpful to point out that the authority to serve in callings comes from the Lord through the men who hold priesthood keys. What truth can we learn from Elisha’s experience about what the Lord does for people He calls to serve Him? Among truths students may offer, point out that the Lord gives authority and power to people whom He calls . Serving with God’s power and authority To help students understand what it means to serve in callings with the Lord’s power and authority, you could write Priesthood Authority and Priesthood Power on the board. Share the following statement from Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ . While this statement applies directly to missionary callings, remind students that the Lord gives authority to the people He calls to serve in any calling and power to those who serve Him righteously. Under Christ’s direction, the authority to preach the gospel was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. When you are set apart as a missionary, you received this authority. With it comes the right, privilege, and responsibility to represent the Lord and teach His gospel. … In addition to authority, you need spiritual power to fulfill your calling. God gives spiritual power as you consistently work to strengthen your testimony of Him, Jesus Christ, and the gospel truths you teach. He bestows spiritual power as you pray, study the scriptures, and seek to fulfill your missionary purpose. He grants spiritual power as you strive to keep His commandments and the covenants you made when you received the ordinances of salvation (see Doctrine and Covenants 35:24 ). ( Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ , [2023], 3) What do you learn about the Lord’s power and authority from these statements? Why might this be helpful to remember when you receive a calling from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Why might this be helpful to remember when you sustain others who receive callings? As students discuss what they learned about priesthood authority and power, you could list what they share under each heading on the board. As part of this discussion, you may point out that God gives priesthood authority to someone when they are set apart in a calling. Priesthood power comes from God as someone strives to keep the commandments and act according to righteous principles (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:34–46 ). Consider showing the video “ Jesus Calls Twelve Apostles to Preach and Bless Others ” (1:38), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . As students watch the video, have them think about how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ manifest Their love by giving Their authority and power to Their servants on earth. 1:39 Following the video, invite a few students to share their thoughts. Demonstrate understanding To help students summarize what they learned, consider organizing the class into pairs for the following activity. Choose one or more of the following situations and discuss what you have learned today that could help the person with their concerns about a calling. In each response, include scriptures, statements from Church leaders, or insights you have received from the Spirit as you’ve studied the story of Elisha’s call to serve. A new bishop is called and sustained. His son knows that he is not perfect. A new Young Women president is called to serve. A young woman had a great relationship with the previous president and doesn’t know the new one at all. A young man or young woman is called to serve as the president of their quorum or class. They do not feel they know enough to fulfill this calling well. A missionary is called to serve in a country where the people speak a different language. They are concerned about how effective they will really be in sharing the gospel. Think of a way to have students share their responses with each other. One way is to have each pair share with a different group. After everyone has a chance to share, you could invite students to share what they really liked about the other group’s response. To conclude, you might testify of truths you have discussed today.\n\n\n--- Lesson 84 ---\nSometimes we may not recognize the spiritual value of doing the small things Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ invite us to do. In 2 Kings 5 , the Lord healed Naaman, a Syrian captain, of his leprosy because he followed the prophet’s simple counsel to wash himself seven times in the Jordan River. This lesson can help students obey the small and simple things the Lord asks us to do. Student preparation: Invite students to read Alma 37:6–7 , looking for what they can learn about small and simple things. Or you could encourage students to pay attention to small things they do often that make a big difference in their life or that affect their relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Possible Learning Activities Drip irrigation Consider displaying an image like the following or bringing a plant to class and demonstrating how drip irrigation works. The information in the next paragraph could help you explain it. Drip irrigation is a technique used to water plants. Unlike other forms of irrigation that apply large amounts of water infrequently, drip irrigation involves slowly dripping small amounts of water onto the soil. The steady drips of water keep the soil moist where it is most useful to the plants. Consider placing students into small groups to discuss answers to the following question. In what ways could the principles of drip irrigation apply to our spiritual progress in Heavenly Father’s plan? Invite a few groups to share what they discussed. Then consider displaying the self-assessment below and inviting students to think about how accurate it is in their life. Take a moment to reflect on the small efforts you are making as a disciple of Jesus Christ and the results you are experiencing. Then ponder the truthfulness of this statement for you: I recognize how the small and simple things I do, or don’t do, affect my life and my relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Invite students to be receptive to thoughts and feelings they receive from the Holy Ghost about small and simple things they can do to strengthen their relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Naaman healed of his leprosy 2 Kings 5 contains the account of Naaman, a Syrian captain who learned a powerful lesson about doing the small and simple things the Lord commands. Read 2 Kings 5:1 , looking for everything you can learn about Naaman. What did you find? You may want to explain that leprosy was a terrible skin disease. It may have caused Naaman to develop disfiguring sores and could have resulted in death. As an alternative to students simply reading the following verses, you could label three parts of your classroom as “Syria,” “Elisha’s house,” and “Jordan River.” Invite four volunteers to represent the following people by reading aloud the accompanying verses in the designated places. Students representing Naaman and his servant could move from place to place, while the little maid and Elisha’s messenger remain in their location. Syria: The little maid read verses 2–4 Elisha’s house: Elisha’s messenger read verses 9–10 Elisha’s house: Naaman read verses 11–12 Jordan River: Naaman’s servant read verses 13–14 Read 2 Kings 5:2–4, 9–14 , looking for what Elisha, as a prophet of God, told Naaman to do to be healed of his leprosy. What are some important lessons a teenager today could learn from Naaman’s experience? Students may state a truth like obedience to the Lord’s small and simple invitations brings great blessings . You might invite them to write this truth as a note next to 2 Kings 5:13–14 in their scriptures and mark the phrases in these verses that teach this truth. Making notes in their scriptures can help students remember truths they learn. You could also invite students to read Alma 37:6–7 , and link or cross-reference these verses to 2 Kings 5:13–14 . Small and simple things The following activity is designed to help students identify small and simple things Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have asked us to do and to discuss how we can be blessed by doing them. One way this activity could be done is by placing students in small groups and giving each group a piece of paper and scissors. Invite each group to draw and cut out three large water drops. For step 1 below, groups could write a different small and simple thing that the Lord has invited us to do on each droplet, then place them on the board. Make a list of small and simple things the Lord has asked us to do that can lead to great blessings. If needed, the following statement could help groups identify small and simple things the Lord has asked us to do as well as ways we are blessed by doing them. President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency shared some examples of small and simple things the Lord has invited us to do. 17:36 Consider the scripture study we’ve been taught to incorporate into our daily lives. Or consider the personal prayers and the kneeling family prayers that are regular practices for faithful Latter-day Saints. Consider attendance at seminary for youth or institute classes for young adults. Though each of these practices may seem to be small and simple, over time they result in powerful spiritual uplift and growth. This occurs because each of these small and simple things invites the companionship of the Holy Ghost, the Testifier who enlightens us and guides us into truth. (“ Small and Simple Things ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 90) Before completing the following step, invite each group to select one drop that a different group placed on the board. Search the scriptures and words of the prophets, looking for the great blessings the Lord offers if we do this small and simple thing. Invite multiple groups to share what they learned. As part of this discussion, you might invite students to reflect on experiences they have had doing small and simple things. You could then invite volunteers to share how the Lord has blessed them and how their relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ was strengthened as a result. The previous prompt can help students verbalize their feelings, experiences, and testimonies. You might also share your testimony or experiences with doing small and simple things the Lord asks of us. For additional training, see: “ Bear testimony often and invite learners to share their feelings, experiences, and testimonies ” in Teacher Development Skills . You could also watch “ Abide the Day in Christ ” ( ChurchofJesusChrist.org ) from time code 2:30 to 4:23. Students could identify how Sister Amy A. Wright, First Counselor in the Primary General Presidency, and her family were strengthened through the small and simple things they had done. 10:33 You could also have students read 2 Kings 5:15 to see the blessing of testimony Naaman received through his obedience to the small and simple thing the prophet invited him to do. Small and simple things in my life To help students make a plan to obey the small and simple things the Lord has asked them to do, display the following instructions. Respond to the following in your study journal: Think of a small and simple thing the Lord has asked you to do that you feel you are already doing well. How has obeying the Lord’s instruction strengthened your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Select a small and simple thing the Lord has asked you to do that you feel inspired to do better. What will you do to improve your obedience to the Lord’s invitation? How could that strengthen your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? You could invite a few willing students to share their response to the first question. Encourage students to follow through on their plan to improve.\n\n\n--- Lesson 85 ---\nWhen surrounded by the Syrian army, the prophet Elisha’s servant cried out in fear, “how shall we do?” ( 2 Kings 6:15 ). Elisha comforted his servant by helping him recognize the Lord’s help. We likewise can be comforted as we learn to recognize the Lord’s help. This lesson can help students feel increased confidence in the Lord’s constant and watchful care. Student preparation: Invite students to prepare to share an experience when the Lord blessed or protected them or someone they know. Possible Learning Activities Recognizing the Savior’s care To begin your lesson, consider drawing a stick figure in the center of the board. The scriptures are filled with the Savior’s promises for His people who strive to serve Him. To visualize one of these promises, draw a stick figure on the center of a page in your study journal and label it Me. Then, read Doctrine and Covenants 84:88 , and draw around your stick figure how you visualize the Lord’s promises. You could invite a student to add to the drawing on the board what they drew in their journal, explaining why they drew what they did. Other students could be invited to add anything different they may have drawn. Alternatively, students could share and explain their drawings with a neighbor. How do you think it might affect someone if they were able to recognize these promises occurring in their life? Why can it be difficult to see or recognize the Lord’s blessings and protection in our lives? It may be helpful to testify that Heavenly Father and the Savior are actively involved in each student’s life. Ponder how well you recognize Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ’s involvement in your life. Then respond to the following questions in your study journal: Can you recognize at least one way Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are blessing or protecting you? If so, how are They doing it? What is a situation you are facing in your life where it could help you to better recognize Their blessings and protection? As you study 2 Kings 6 , invite the Holy Ghost to help you recognize ways Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are blessing and protecting you. Divine help Consider explaining the following information to help students understand the context of 2 Kings 6 . During a time of war between Israel and Syria, the king of Syria privately discussed his battle plans with his servants. However, the Lord repeatedly revealed Syria’s plans to the prophet Elisha, who would then warn the king of Israel. When the king of Syria discovered this, he sent an army to capture Elisha (see 2 Kings 6:8–13 ). Choose an effective way for students to study the following verses to help them identify converting principles. For example, it may be helpful for students to study from the perspective of Elisha’s servant. They could occasionally pause and think about how they would feel if they were in his place. Students could also read as a class or in small groups, with different students reading the parts for Elisha, Elisha’s servant, and the king of Israel. It may be helpful to explain that Samaria was the capital city of the kingdom of Israel. Read 2 Kings 6:14–23 , looking for ways the Lord blessed and protected Elisha and his servant. What impressed you from the story? What truths from this story could be relevant to us today? Consider sharing the following truth if students did not already share a similar truth in their own words: The Lord can help us recognize His blessings and protection in our lives. How do you think recognizing the Lord’s blessings and protection affected Elisha and his servant? Recognizing the Lord’s blessings and protection To help students recognize some ways the Lord can bless and protect them, you could organize them into pairs or small groups for the following activity. Note: Students will be given an opportunity to reflect on the list they create in this activity in Lesson 96: “ Assess Your Learning 6 .” Make a list of different ways the Lord might watch over and care for us. List as many as you can think of in two minutes. After the two minutes, you could invite them to look for additional ideas they could include from Mosiah 24:13–15 ; Doctrine and Covenants 8:2–3 ; 38:7 or other scripture passages you might suggest. You could also share the following statement from President Eyring. President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency taught the following about the Lord’s help: Like that servant of Elisha, there are more with you than those you can see opposed to you. Some who are with you will be invisible to your mortal eyes. The Lord will bear you up and will at times do it by calling others to stand with you. (“ O Ye That Embark ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2008, 58) Consider inviting groups to take turns sharing examples from their lists while you or volunteers write them on the board. You might allow groups to keep sharing until all unique ideas have been shared. Invite students to share examples they can think of from the scriptures when the Lord watched over or cared for someone in the ways listed on the board. As you discuss the following questions, you may choose to share when you have recognized God’s blessings or help in your life. What can make some of these blessings from the Lord harder to recognize than others? When has the Lord blessed or protected you, or someone you know, in one of these ways? What does this experience teach you about the Lord? Opening our eyes Consider concluding the lesson by displaying the following quote and instructions. Sister Michelle D. Craig, formerly of the Young Women General Presidency, explained what we can do if we struggle to see how God is working in our lives: 9:45 There may be times when you, like the servant, find yourself struggling to see how God is working in your life—times when you feel under siege—when the trials of mortality bring you to your knees. Wait and trust in God and in His timing, because you can trust His heart with all of yours. But there is a second lesson here. My dear sisters and brothers, you too can pray for the Lord to open your eyes to see things you would not normally see. (“ Eyes to See ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 15) Consider answering the following question in your study journal: What did you learn today that helps you feel confident the Lord watches over and cares for you? Testify of the Lord’s love and of His ability to help students recognize His help in their lives.\n\n\n--- Lesson 86 ---\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ love us and will help us as we put our trust in Them. After the Assyrians conquered Samaria, they began attacking Judah. King Hezekiah and his people turned to the Lord for strength and protection. The Lord delivered them from the Assyrians. This lesson can help increase students’ trust that the Lord will help them face their challenges. Student preparation: Invite students to come to class prepared to share an experience when they felt God’s support during a challenging time. Possible Learning Activities During hard times Consider beginning class by writing the following words in the middle of the board: helpless , overwhelmed , discouraged , fearful , and doubtful . Then you could write one of the following questions on the left side of the board and the other question on the right side of the board. Students could write their answers to each question on the board. What are situations where a teenager might feel one or more of these emotions? Where might teenagers turn to for help when they experience these emotions? You could then invite students to think or write in their study journal about a current or future situation where they might feel similar emotions. Students will have an opportunity to refer back to these emotions later in the lesson. Reflect on the following questions as they relate to your own personal situation: When you experience these emotions, where do you turn for help? How confident are you that the Lord will help you when you turn to Him? Throughout the lesson today, think about how the Lord can help you when you experience these emotions now or in the future. Pay attention to the impressions that come to your mind and heart from the Holy Ghost. Hezekiah trusts the Lord Explain to students that this lesson will focus on how Hezekiah, the king of Judah, chose to turn to the Lord for help when he and his people faced great challenges. Read 2 Kings 18:1–7 , looking for what Hezekiah did when he became king. What did you find? What principles can we learn from verses 5–7 ? Help students identify principles such as: As we trust in the Lord and keep His commandments, He will be with us. Likening the scriptures to our lives Israel, the nation on Judah’s northern border, was conquered by Assyria. Then, the Assyrians attacked Hezekiah’s people and captured all the fortified cities in their kingdom (see 2 Kings 18:9–13 ). Assyrian messengers then came to Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, to deliver a warning to Hezekiah and his people. Look back at the emotions on the board. Which emotions do you think the people of Jerusalem might have been feeling? Consider using the handout “ An Example of Trusting the Lord ” to help students understand the principle they identified earlier and make connections between Hezekiah and their lives. Students could complete the handout in groups or partnerships. You could invite students to reorganize groups after completing each section of the handout, giving students opportunities to work with and get to know other members of the class. Open PDF Questions that help students find personal relevance to the scripture block can allow the Lord to teach and inspire them personally. The questions in the handout could help students relate the verses they studied to their own lives. For additional training on helping students find relevance in the scripture block, see: “ Help learners find personal relevance in the doctrine of Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills . The Lord is with us Read 2 Kings 19:32–35 , looking for how the Lord delivered Hezekiah and his people. What did you find? Consider inviting students to mark the phrase “For I will defend this city, to save it” in 2 Kings 19:34 . As needed, explain that the Lord’s deliverance will come in His time and way. To help students consider ways the Lord helps us face our challenges, you could show “Heavenly Father Knows Me” (3:18) and ask students to look for how Heavenly Father delivered this young woman from a challenge she faced. Then, invite students to share their own experiences. You might consider sharing a personal experience of trusting the Lord or how He has helped you during difficult times. 3:19 How have Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ supported you or someone you know during a difficult situation? You could also let students feel the power of a prophetic testimony of the Savior to end class. To do this, you could invite students to read Alma 36:3 or the following statement. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, testified of the power of trusting God. 19:11 Rather than dwelling on the immensity of our challenges, would it not be better to focus on the infinite greatness, goodness, and absolute power of our God, trusting Him and preparing with a joyful heart for the return of Jesus the Christ? As His covenant people, we need not be paralyzed by fear because bad things might happen. Instead, we can move forward with faith, courage, determination, and trust in God as we approach the challenges and opportunities ahead. (“ Perfect Love Casteth Out Fear ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2017, 106) Encourage students to trust Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ during hard times.\n\n\n--- Lesson 87 ---\nHave you ever wondered how your life might be different if you didn’t have the scriptures? When the kingdom of Judah fell away from God, the “book of the law“ ( 2 Kings 22:8, 11 ) was disregarded and eventually lost in the temple. During Josiah’s renovation of the temple the high priest Hilkiah found the book of the law, which Josiah then read to the people. The scriptures helped King Josiah and his people turn back to the Lord. This lesson can help students turn to the Lord through personal scripture study. Student preparation: Invite students to review their personal scripture study goals and their efforts to read the assigned Old Testament chapters. Encourage them to continue working on their goals or to prayerfully make needed adjustments to be successful. Possible Learning Activities Life without scriptures Before class, consider placing a bookmark in a Bible at 2 Kings 22:8 . Hide the Bible in the classroom to use later in the lesson. Write the following incomplete question on the board: What would your life be like without ? Consider providing each student with a small piece of paper. Invite them to write down a common item or activity that could complete the question. For example, they could write words like shoes , toothbrushes , school , or sports . Place students in small groups. Invite them to discuss how they would answer the question if it were completed with the words they have written. When students have finished sharing, give them time to silently consider the following: Reflect on your personal experiences as you ponder the following questions: What would your life be like without the scriptures ? How has your recent study of the scriptures influenced your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? You might ask a few volunteers to share their responses. To add to the discussion, you could display the following statement. Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught about our need for the scriptures. Those who either don’t have or ignore the recorded word of God eventually cease to believe in Him and forget the purpose of their existence. (“ The Blessing of Scripture ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2010, 33) Later in the lesson, students will have an opportunity to identify and share scripture passages and reflect on their personal study goals. You might adjust portions of this lesson to allow sufficient time for the “Student sharing” and “Scripture study goals” sections. The influence of scriptures Over time, the scriptures had been lost, and the kingdom of Judah turned away from the Lord. Under the reign of kings Manasseh and Amon, the people engaged in idolatry and other wicked practices, including the sacrifice of children (see 2 Kings 21 ). After the death of Amon, his son, Josiah, was made king at the age of eight. Josiah was righteous. In the 18th year of his reign, Josiah arranged payment for workers to repair the temple in Jerusalem (see 2 Kings 22:1–7 ). If you hid a Bible before class, explain that there are lost scriptures somewhere in the classroom. Invite students to find them. Ask the student who finds the Bible to locate the bookmark. Then provide the following instructions: Read 2 Kings 22:8–13 , looking for what happened as the temple was being repaired. What did Hilkiah the high priest find? How did King Josiah respond after hearing the words of the book, or the scriptures? Josiah decided to read the book to all the people of Jerusalem (see 2 Kings 22:14–20 ; 23:1–2 ). You could help students visualize what they’ve read by watching “ Josiah and the Book of the Law ” (12:25) from time code 7:02 to 8:37. This video is available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 12:25 Read 2 Kings 23:1–3 , looking for the influence that reading the scriptures had on Josiah and his people. Consider marking what you find. What can we learn from these verses about the effect of scripture study in our lives? Among the insights students share, they might identify that studying the scriptures can help us turn to the Lord with all our hearts . This could be written on the board and referenced throughout the remainder of the lesson. To better understand this principle, students could complete the following with a partner. Each student could study one set of verses. Then partners could share with one another what they learned and discuss the accompanying questions. As Josiah and his people learned from the scriptures and turned to the Lord, they were inspired to make changes in their lives. Read your assigned verses, looking for the changes they made. Student 1 2 Kings 23:4, 24 . Why do you think the people needed to destroy all their idols to turn to the Lord with all their hearts? How can scripture study help us turn away from the evil influences in our lives? Student 2 2 Kings 23:21–22 . What religious practice did Josiah and his people follow again after reading the scriptures? How can scripture study help us remember the Savior and live His gospel? You could conclude the story of Josiah by watching “ Josiah and the Book of the Law“ from time code 8:37 to 10:20. 12:25 Student sharing This portion of the lesson is designed for personal reflection and sharing. Students can share how the scriptures have helped (or could help) them turn to the Lord. President Spencer W. Kimball (1895–1985) taught of the influence scripture study had on his life: I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns. ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 67) Identify a scripture passage that has helped (or could help) you turn to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. It could be from your personal or family scripture study or a previous seminary lesson, or it could be a doctrinal mastery passage. Prepare to share the following: How has this passage helped (or how could it help) you turn to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ with all your heart? When students are ready to share, invite everyone to write their passages on the board around the truth that they identified earlier. Ask for multiple volunteers to read their passage and share their insights or experiences. If needed, you could also share passages that have helped you turn to the Lord. Consider pointing to passages on the board that haven’t been shared. You might ask if the students who wrote them would be willing to share. Or you might invite the class to read the passage and discuss how it could help us turn to the Lord. As students are sharing, you might ask follow-up questions to encourage class discussion. For example, you might ask, “Has anyone else had an experience with that passage? Would you be willing to share?” or “What thoughts and feelings have you had as you’ve listened to each other?” Scripture study goals Consider sharing your witness that your students can have a similar experience as Josiah did as he studied the scriptures (see 2 Kings 23:25 ). Invite students to review their goals for personal scripture study and their progress in reading the assigned chapters of the Old Testament. Give them time to reflect on the following questions: Do you feel your current scripture study goal is helping you fully turn to the Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? If so, how have you seen this happen? If not, what adjustments will you make? What meaningful experiences have you had with reading the assigned Old Testament chapters? What will you do to ensure you complete the assigned readings? Encourage students to continue their efforts to study the scriptures daily.\n\n\n--- Lesson 88 ---\nProphets and others often speak about the gathering of Israel. To understand the gathering, it can help to understand why Israel was scattered in the first place. This lesson can help students use the scattering of Israel to identify attributes of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to read Thoughts to Keep in Mind: “Jesus Will Say to All Israel, ‘Come Home’” from Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026 . Ask them to come prepared to share thoughts or questions about the scattering of Israel. Possible Learning Activities The scattering of Israel Before class, you might want to label different areas in classroom as Northern Kingdom (Israel) , Southern Kingdom (Judah) , Assyria , the Americas , and Babylon/Persia . How and when might disciplining a child be a sign of love from their parent? Read Doctrine and Covenants 95:1 , looking for how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ feel about people They need to correct or chasten. Several times in the Old Testament, Israel rebelled against Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and needed correction. This resulted in what is called the scattering of Israel. As you study the scattering of Israel, look for how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ demonstrated their love. Throughout the next two sections of the lesson, students will move around the classroom to understand how Israel was scattered. Divide students evenly into two groups. Have one group move near the area of the classroom labeled Northern Kingdom (Israel) , and the other group near the Southern Kingdom (Judah) . Rather than have students move around the classroom, you could display the graphic “ The Kingdoms of Israel and Judah at a Glance .” Students could read the same verses and discuss the same questions from the lesson, but simply follow along with this graphic. Northern Kingdom of Israel In about 975 BC, after Solomon died, his son Rehoboam became king. Rehoboam imposed great burdens on the people. Ten of the tribes rebelled against Rehoboam and followed Jeroboam (see 1 Kings 12:6–11, 19–20 ). This separation created the Northern and Southern Kingdoms. Read 2 Kings 17:7–18, 22–23 , looking for what happened to the Northern Kingdom of Israel. What happened to them and why did it happen? Explain that when Assyria conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel and took many of the Israelites back to Assyria, this began the scattering of Israel. Ask most of the students standing near the Northern Kingdom (Israel) to move to the part of the room labeled Assyria . Point out that we often call these tribes the lost tribes of Israel. You could give the students that moved to Assyria a label that says Lost Tribes . You could give the students who remain in Israel a label that says Samaritans . You might want to explain that the Samaritans were part Israelite and part Gentile (see Guide to the Scriptures, “ Samaritans ,” Gospel Library). How would you summarize why Israel was scattered? Students might identify a truth like: Because Israel rejected the prophets and broke their covenant with the Lord, He scattered them among the nations. Southern Kingdom of Judah What have you learned so far about the Southern Kingdom of Judah, including the kings who have reigned there? Invite students to share any accounts they remember. For example, they might bring up King Hezekiah or King Josiah. If they do, you could create a label for each king and have students hold them up. Encourage students to share how the Lord blessed these kings and the people for their faith in Him. Both of these righteous kings reigned after Assyria conquered the Kingdom of Israel. Students might also mention Lehi and his family. If they do, invite them to share what they know. If they don’t, you could have them do the following. You could create a label for Lehi and his family for a few students to hold. Read 1 Nephi 1:4 , looking for who else lived in the Kingdom of Judah. Read 1 Nephi 2:1–4 ; 18:22–23 , looking for what happened to this family. What blessings from Heavenly Father have we received because the Lord led Lehi and his family away from Jerusalem as part of the scattering? Ask the students holding the Lehi and his family label to move from the Kingdom of Judah to the section of the class labeled The Americas . Read 2 Chronicles 36:17–20 , looking for what Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, did to the inhabitants of Jerusalem shortly after Lehi and his family left. Ask the remaining students in Kingdom of Judah to move to the area of the classroom representing Babylon/Persia . Approximately between 605 and 587 BC, the Babylonians carried away many Jews to Babylon and besieged and eventually destroyed Jerusalem (see 2 Kings 24:8–16 ; 25:1–12, 21 ; Jeremiah 52 ). You might want to ask students to name a few individuals who ended up in Babylon. If they need help, you could hand a few students labels such as Daniel , Shadrach , Meshach , Abed-nego (see Daniel 1:1–7 ), and Ezekiel (see Guide to the Scriptures, “ Ezekiel ,” Gospel Library). Read the following summary. Explain that some Jews remained in Persia (see Esther 2:5–7 ). Ask some students in Babylon/Persia to return to the area of the classroom representing Kingdom of Judah . You could create labels for Ezra and Nehemiah for a couple students to carry who move to Kingdom of Judah . Students will learn more about Ezra and Nehemiah later. Under King Cyrus the Persians conquered Babylon. Around 537 BC, the Lord inspired King Cyrus of Persia to permit the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (see 2 Chronicles 36:22–23 ; Jeremiah 29:10–14 ; Ezra 1:1–3 ). In the years that followed, Ezra, Nehemiah, and others returned to Jerusalem to help rebuild the city and complete the temple (see Ezra 7:6–8 ; Nehemiah 2:1–11 ). Heavenly Father’s children are never lost to Him You might want to point out that many of these groups did not know what was happening to the other groups. From their perspective, the other groups were lost. Read 3 Nephi 17:4 , looking for what the Savior shared with the Nephites during His ministry among them. What stands out to you in this verse? You might point out that although Israel was scattered, the Lord used the scattering of His covenant people to bless the nations they were scattered to (see “ The scattering of Israel ” under Guide to the Scriptures, “ Israel ,” Gospel Library). You may want to point out that “kindness” in Isaiah 54:8 is a translation of hesed . For more on the significance of hesed see President Nelson’s article “ Everlasting Covenant ,” Liahona , Oct. 2022, 5–6. Read Deuteronomy 4:27–31 and Isaiah 54:7–10 , looking for what the Lord promised to do for scattered Israel. What attributes do you see in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you learn about the scattering of Israel? Consider sharing your testimony of Heavenly Father’s love for all His children and of His promise to gather scattered Israel.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 90 ---\nSome people might seek Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ only when things are going well. Others might cry out for Their help only in times of trouble. Like Asa, the king of Judah, we can seek the Lord during both peaceful and difficult times. This lesson can help students make a plan to seek the Lord. Student preparation: Invite students to make a list of ways they could seek the Lord in their lives. Possible Learning Activities Seeking to find Consider beginning the lesson by inviting students to think about how we look for things that are lost. You could list or display a few things that vary in value, such as a pencil, an important homework assignment, a cell phone, a gift from a loved one, and so on. Ask students what efforts they would put into finding each item if it were lost. Why do your efforts to find something differ depending on what you are looking for? Consider writing Seek the Lord at the top of the board. What do you think it means to seek the Lord? If students struggle to answer, you might ask how they get to know someone and develop a good relationship. Then ask how they might seek to know and develop a relationship with the Lord. You might explain that the Hebrew word for seek in the verses they will study today ( 2 Chronicles 14:4 ; 15:2, 12 ; 16:12 ) is darash and means to search for, ask, visit, pursue, consult, or apply oneself to. In your study journal, respond to the following questions: What are some things that you or others you know have done to seek the Lord? How much effort do you give to seek the Lord? As you study today, look for ways you can seek the Lord. Write any thoughts or feelings that come to you from the Holy Ghost. An example of seeking the Lord Consider sharing or summarizing the following paragraph. The books of Chronicles and Kings cover roughly the same time period. In 2 Chronicles 14–16 and 1 Kings 15 , we read an account of King Asa, the third king of Judah. You could create the following chart on the board to help students with the next activity. Students could also create the chart in their study journals. How Asa and his people sought the Lord How the Lord blessed them How Asa and his people sought the Lord How the Lord blessed them Consider separating students into four different groups. Ask each group to read a different set of the following verses. A student from each group could write what they learned on the board. If students need help understanding “groves” in 2 Chronicles 14:3 , explain that they were places where people worshipped false gods. Read one of the following sets of verses, looking for what Asa and his people did and how God blessed them: 2 Chronicles 14:3–7 . During a time of peace 2 Chronicles 14:9–13 . When the Ethiopians attacked 2 Chronicles 15:1–9 . During a time of peace 2 Chronicles 15:10–12, 15 . During a time of peace Ask the following question to help students identify a truth from what they have studied. As students share, add their responses to the chart on the board. What did you learn from the experiences of Asa and his people? Using the students’ words, help them identify truths such as the following: As I seek the Lord with all my heart, He will give me rest ( 2 Chronicles 14:7 ; 15:15 ) If I seek the Lord, I will find Him ( 2 Chronicles 15:2 ) As students share, consider asking follow-up questions to help them think about what some of the words or phrases might mean. For example, you might ask, “What do you think it means to find the Lord?” or “What might it look like for the Lord to give us rest?” For teachings that might help with these or other questions, see the Additional Resources section. Seeking and finding the Lord Help students make connections between Asa’s life and their own lives. You might relabel the existing chart on the board with How I can seek the Lord in the left column and How the Lord might bless me in the right column. Then invite students to do the following in groups or on their own. In addition to what Asa and his people did, add to the left-hand column of your list ways you can seek the Lord. These ways might come from your own experience, examples in scriptures or Church history, or talks from Church leaders. Students could add their examples to the left-hand column on the board. If you feel the following activities would help students identify meaningful ways to seek the Lord, you could do either or both: Direct students to the “Invitations” portion of each of the major sections in For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices (2022). Major sections include “Jesus Christ will help you,” “Love God, love your neighbor,” and so on. Watch “ Make Time for the Lord ” from time code 1:00 to 3:29 (available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). As students listen to President Russell M. Nelson, invite them to identify ways that we can seek the Lord. 5:49 You might want to help students think about obstacles they might face while striving to do the actions they just shared. To do so, consider asking the following questions. What can distract us from seeking the Lord? What helps you seek the Lord despite distractions? Consider inviting them to mark the phrase “he will be found of you” in 2 Chronicles 15:2 . To help students think of ways we can find the Lord, ask the following. How has the Lord blessed you or someone you know as you have sought Him? After students share, encourage them to write their thoughts in the right hand column of the chart. You might want to testify that the blessings students shared could be evidence that they have found Him. Making a plan Help students act on something they have felt or learned during the lesson. To do so, encourage them to consider the impressions they might have received from the Spirit throughout class. Also, in lesson 87 , students revisited their scripture study goals as a way to come closer to the Lord. If useful, they could evaluate how their goals are going and decide if they would like to use their goals in this plan as well. Pick one thing you can do to seek the Lord. Answer the following questions in your study journal. Plan how you can include this action in your life. Why do you think this action might help you find the Lord more in your life? What challenges might you face as you strive to do this? What specific steps can you take to do it despite these challenges? Consider ending class with your own testimony of the blessings of seeking the Lord.\n\n\n--- Lesson 91 ---\nDo you ever wonder what you can do to draw closer to Jesus Christ? The Old Testament king Jehoshaphat was a great example of doing just that. His people had fallen away from God and engaged in idol worship. Jehoshaphat chose to follow Jehovah and helped his people do the same. This lesson can help students learn to identify gospel principles from the scriptures. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to reflect on what they are learning in their personal and family study of the scriptures. They could come to class ready to share a principle they found and how it helps them. Possible Learning Activities Anchors of safety Show the following picture of someone rock climbing. If you were to climb a cliff, what equipment would you need? Why is this equipment necessary? If we compare our lives to climbing a cliff, what has the Lord given you to help you safely succeed? Students might share a variety of answers. As they do, thank them for their responses, and ask why these things would help. The following answer is the focus of this lesson. Elder Richard G. Scott (1928–2015) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught: You and I can be assured of reaching worthy objectives in life by understanding and consistently following correct principles rooted in revealed truth. Principles are anchors of safety. They are like the steel anchors a mountaineer uses to conquer otherwise impossible cliffs. They will help you have confidence in new and unfamiliar circumstances. They will provide you protection in life’s storms of adversity. (“ The Power of Correct Principles ,” Ensign , May 1993, 32) One of the ways that Heavenly Father has lovingly provided us with true principles is through the scriptures. As we study the scriptures, we seek to identify these principles or statements of truth that can help us in our lives. It might be helpful to have students reflect on their current ability to identify principles in the scriptures. Here is one way to do this. Take a moment to ponder the following questions: How confident am I in my ability to identify principles? How well do I understand how principles can help me in my life? As you study this lesson on the life of Jehoshaphat, seek the help of the Holy Ghost to identify true principles that can help you. Principles from the life of Jehoshaphat Following the death of his father, Jehoshaphat became king of Judah. Israel and Judah had both fallen away from the Lord Jesus Christ. They worshipped false gods. Read 2 Chronicles 17:3–4 ; 19:4 , and see what you learn about Jehoshaphat. (Note: Baalim refers to false gods.) What impresses you about Jehoshaphat? When Jehoshaphat came into power, his people were in apostasy. Jehoshaphat made many efforts throughout his kingdom to help his people follow Jehovah (Jesus Christ). During this time, the enemies of Jehoshaphat came up to battle against his people. What happened in these circumstances illustrates a variety of principles. Consider explaining the following study skill to identify principles. One way to identify a principle is to look for how two things relate. For example: because of A, B happens. Or because a person does A, the Lord promises or gives B. Read through the following verses as a class to give students an opportunity to practice using the skill. Read 2 Chronicles 17:6 and 19:3 , looking for principles in the life of Jehoshaphat. (Note: high places and groves were places to worship false gods.) Some principles students might identify are: As we focus our lives on God, we can more easily remove evil from our lives (see 2 Chronicles 17:6 ). As we remove evil from our lives, we are more prepared to seek God (see 2 Chronicles 19:3 ). Why are these principles helpful? After identifying principles from the previous verses as a class, invite students to practice identifying principles in small groups or on their own. Have them use the following verses. Read 2 Chronicles 20:1–9, 14–17, 20–22 , looking for additional true principles. Some principles students might identify are: As we fast and pray for deliverance, the Lord will be with us in our challenges (see 2 Chronicles 20:1–4, 14–17 ). As we seek the Lord in His temple, He will hear and help us (see 2 Chronicles 20:9 ). As we believe in the Lord and his prophets, we will prosper (see 2 Chronicles 20:20 ). As we praise the Lord through music, He will bless us (see 2 Chronicles 20:21–22 ). If students struggle to identify principles, consider writing some or all of the principles above on the board. Invite students to identify which of the verses studied teach each principle. Understanding principles For the following activity, students can use any of the principles above, or they can use a principle that they learned recently in their personal or family study. Choose a principle you would like to learn more about. Prepare a two-minute talk on this truth that includes the following: A verse or verses you read in 2 Chronicles about this principle, and why you selected it Other scriptures or words of the prophets that help you understand this principle A time when the Savior or someone else in scriptures or Church history exemplified this principle Ways you feel this principle from the Lord can help us or keep us safe An experience when you or someone you know acted according to this principle, and any blessings from the Lord that came as a result Students could share their talks with a partner or small group. Or you might invite a few willing students who studied different principles to share their talks with the class. Between each student’s talk, you could invite the class to share any comments or questions they have about the principle the student shared. Make sure to provide enough time for students to prepare and share their two-minute talks. From what you learned today, why is it useful to strive to find the principles that the Lord has given us in scripture? How might you use what you learned today in your family and personal study? Encourage students to come to know the Savior better by making personal connections to their lives from the scriptures. The previous question is an example of encouraging students to connect what they are learning in seminary with their study at home. You might want to look for other ways to do this. You can also ask how what they are learning at home connects to what they are learning in seminary. (For additional training on this, see “ Develop and ask questions that help learners connect what they have learned in their personal and family scripture study to the classroom experience ” in Teacher Development Skills .)\n\n\n--- Lesson 92 ---\nOur level of preparation for important events in our lives can greatly affect the experience we have. Many Israelites were able to experience deep joy after years of physical and spiritual preparation to rebuild and worship in a temple of God. Our Heavenly Father and Savior have also blessed us with opportunities to experience joy by worshipping in the house of the Lord. Our efforts to prepare for that blessing can affect our experience. This lesson can help students feel a greater desire to prepare to worship the Lord in His holy temple. Student preparation: Invite students to make a list of both short- and long-term things they could do to prepare to worship the Lord in the temple. They could then consider how their preparation can affect their temple experience. Possible Learning Activities Looking forward to the temple You might begin class by inviting students to write on the board some future events they are excited to experience. Examples could include graduation, marriage, and careers. Students could then pick one event from the board and share with a partner one or two things someone could do to prepare for that event. Consider displaying the following image of the Salt Lake temple when it was nearly ready to be dedicated in the 1890s. Read the following statement from President Wilford Woodruff (1807–98), looking for something that he had been preparing for and looking forward to for many years. [At the dedication of the Salt Lake temple] President Wilford Woodruff then arose to address the Saints. “I have looked forward to this day for the last fifty years of my life,” he said. ( Saints: The Story of the Church of Jesus Christ in the Latter Days , vol. 2, No Unhallowed Hand, 1846–1893 [2020], 663–64) What do you know about temples that may have caused Wilford Woodruff to look forward to the completion of the Salt Lake temple? If students did not mention God as they answered the previous question, you could help them make that connection by asking a question like, “What connection do you see between attending the temple and our relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?” Invite students to write their thoughts about the following questions in their study journal. You may want to explain that taking time to reflect on our current feelings and experiences can help prepare us to learn from the Holy Ghost. What are my feelings as I look ahead to attending the temple in the future? What am I doing to prepare myself to worship the Lord in His house? Joy in temple service Around 605 BC Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and began deporting captive Jews to Babylon. In 587 BC, they destroyed the temple, and the deportations escalated. About 50 years later, Persia conquered Babylon under the command of King Cyrus. If your students remember a temple being announced in their area, you might remind them of that experience as they read the following verses. Or you might ask students to try to imagine how they will feel if a temple were to be announced in their area. Read Ezra 1:1–3 , looking for what God inspired King Cyrus to do. What thoughts and feelings do you think the Jews might have had? Why? Eventually, around 50,000 Jews returned to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple under the direction of Zerubbabel (see Ezra 2:1–2, 64–65 ). As a fulfillment of prophecy (see Isaiah 44:28 ; Jeremiah 29:10 ), the temple was rebuilt 70 years after it had been destroyed. Read Ezra 6:15–16, 22 and mark how the Jews felt when the temple was finally dedicated after many years of hard work and spiritual preparation. As students continue to study the account of the people in Ezra, invite them to watch for evidence of this truth: As we prepare to worship the Lord in the temple, He will bless us with joy You may want to write this truth on the board. Help students understand what this truth could look like in a teenager’s life. One way to do this is to invite the class to briefly describe two teenagers: one who simply attends the temple and one who prepares to worship the Lord in the temple. Before asking the following question, you might invite students to ponder experiences they have had preparing for, or attending, the temple. How can worshipping the Lord in the temple bring us joy? To give students an example of how worshipping the Lord in the temple can bring joy, consider watching the experience of Elder Kevin R. Duncan of the Seventy in “Hearts, Love, and the Temple,” available at byui.edu/devotionals from time code 21:46 to 24:05. After the video, you could invite students to share how our relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ can be strengthened through temple worship. Preparing to attend the temple The following statement can help students transition from learning about the Jews building the temple in Jerusalem to their own preparation to worship in the temple. Students could write or link the statement in their scriptures next to Ezra 6:15–16 . President Russell M. Nelson taught: In some respects, it is easier to build a temple than it is to build a people prepared for a temple. (“ Closing Remarks ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 122–23) Invite students to share reasons why it might be easier to build a temple than to be prepared to worship the Lord in the temple. We can learn about preparing to worship the Lord in the temple by studying the Jews’ experience rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem. The accompanying handout can help students find greater relevance in the book of Ezra to their lives by comparing the Jews’ efforts to build the temple to our preparations to worship the Lord in His temples. Students could complete the handout in small groups. To do this, each member of the group could complete one or two sections of the handout. They could then share what they learned with their group. Alternatively, you could cut the handout into sections and place them throughout the classroom. Groups of students could rotate through the classroom and complete each section of the handout, answering the questions in their study journals. Open PDF After students have completed the handout, ensure that they have time to discuss insights that stood out to them. Consider displaying the following questions. Make three columns on the board titled “1,” “2,” and “3.” Invite students to write their name in the column under the question number that they would be willing to answer. Invite volunteers from each column to share their answers with the class. How do you think preparing to attend the Lord’s house can help us experience joy as we attend the temple? How has the Lord blessed you with joy as you have attended the temple? What do you know about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that would motivate you to prepare to attend Their holy house? Consider sharing your witness of the joy we receive from the Lord when we prepare ourselves to worship Him in the temple.\n\n\n--- Lesson 93 ---\nGod inspired Nehemiah to protect his people by rebuilding the walls around Jerusalem. Nehemiah’s people had to overcome constant threats and distractions to accomplish this work. We too have been given important work from God, and we too may face difficulties in accomplishing it. This lesson is meant to encourage students to remain focused on the work Heavenly Father has given them to do. Student preparation: Invite students to come to class with a list of three things that they feel Heavenly Father would have them focus on: one thing for this week, one for the next few years, and one for later in life. You might suggest that students who already have their patriarchal blessing read it again before creating their list. Possible Learning Activities Distraction Consider beginning class by helping students recognize things that could draw their attention away from doing God’s work. To do this, you could show the video “ Doing What Matters Most ” (1:42), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Or you could share the information in the following paragraph and display the statement below from President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency. 1:42 Years ago, as pilots prepared to land a plane, a tiny light in the cockpit failed to illuminate. The crew became so focused on the lightbulb that they failed to notice the plane was descending into a swamp. The plane crashed, killing over 100 people. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, taught an important lesson from this tragedy: The plane was in perfect mechanical condition. Everything was working properly—all except one thing: a single burned-out lightbulb. That tiny bulb—worth about 20 cents—started the chain of events that ultimately led to the tragic death of over 100 people. Of course, the malfunctioning lightbulb didn’t cause the accident; it happened because the crew placed its focus on something that seemed to matter at the moment while losing sight of what mattered most. The tendency to focus on the insignificant at the expense of the profound happens not only to pilots but to everyone. We are all at risk. (“ We Are Doing a Great Work and Cannot Come Down ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2009, 59) Invite students to share how they think President Uchtdorf’s message can apply to us as disciples of Jesus Christ. Then you might display the following statement and ask students to silently read it. Encourage them to ask Heavenly Father to guide them through the Spirit to understand how this message applies to them personally. They could record their thoughts in their study journals. President Uchtdorf continued: Pause for a moment and check where your own heart and thoughts are. Are you focused on the things that matter most? How you spend your quiet time may provide a valuable clue. Where do your thoughts go when the pressure of deadlines is gone? Are your thoughts and heart focused on those short-lived fleeting things that matter only in the moment or on things that matter most? (“ We Are Doing a Great Work and Cannot Come Down ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2009, 60) Nehemiah’s work Explain to students that an Israelite named Nehemiah was a servant of Artaxerxes, king of Persia. Many Israelites had returned to Jerusalem years earlier to rebuild the temple. Nehemiah learned that they were in danger of attack because the protective walls and gates around Jerusalem were broken down. Consider inviting students to complete the following activity in small groups. Encourage groups to not rush through the steps, but to take their time and learn from Nehemiah’s experience. To help groups stay on the same schedule, you may want to display only one step of the instructions at a time. Give groups enough time to complete that step before displaying the subsequent step. Read Nehemiah 1:1–4 ; 2:1–6, 11–12, 17–18 . Look for and discuss evidence that Nehemiah’s desires to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem were inspired of God. Write on a blank piece of paper three things God has asked Latter-day Saint teenagers to focus on through His prophets. One way to do this is to briefly review talks from the most recent general conference. Then, exchange papers with another group and discuss with your group what they wrote. ( Note : Keep the other group’s paper. In step four of this activity, you will add things to it.) Read Nehemiah 2:19 ; 4:1, 7–8 , looking for how the Jews’ enemies reacted to the work God gave them. Discuss ways that Satan uses similar tactics today to get us to lose focus on what God asks us to do. Next to each of the three things listed on the other group’s paper, write a distraction or difficulty that could make it hard for a teenager to stay focused on the work God has given them through His prophets. Read Nehemiah 4:9, 14–20 and discuss what you learn from Nehemiah’s people about overcoming distractions and difficulties in accomplishing the work Heavenly Father gives us. Return the paper to the original group. Read and discuss the distractions and difficulties the other group added to your paper. Discuss ideas of how someone could overcome them and stay focused on the work God has given teenagers through His prophets. Summarize in one sentence what you learned or felt about doing the work Heavenly Father has given us. Write this truth on the board. After the activity, encourage volunteers to share what they learned or felt with the class. You might invite students to point out a truth on the board that another group wrote and share what they learned from it. As students share truths, help them focus on Jesus Christ by asking questions such as, “What teachings or examples from the Savior’s life help us better understand this truth?” Examples of truths groups might have written are: Through prayer, we can receive protection and strength from God to accomplish His work. ( Nehemiah 1:4 ; 4:9 ) God will help His servants overcome opposition to doing His work . ( Nehemiah 4:20 ) How can what you learned in this activity help you remain focused on the work God has given you to do? The video “ The Soul’s Sincere Desire ” (3:28), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , could help students notice and discuss how even good things can become distractions from focusing on the more important work God has given us. 3:29 Personal application Explain to students that Nehemiah was individually targeted by his enemies. They tried many tactics to stop him from doing God’s work of rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls. One tactic was to try to lure him out of the city to where they could more easily harm him. Invite students to silently complete the following. You may want to give them plenty of time and encourage them to think about how they feel God would have them complete the statements. Read Nehemiah 6:1–4, 15–16 and ponder what you learn from Nehemiah’s response to his enemies’ attempts to pull him away from God’s work. (You may want to mark and ponder what verse 3 could mean in your life.) Complete the following statements based on your life. Record your thoughts in your study journal or in the margin of your scriptures next to verse 3 . I believe Heavenly Father would like me to focus on . Some potential distractions or difficulties I might face are . Some ways I can remain focused on Heavenly Father’s work are .",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 94 ---\nHave you ever wondered why Heavenly Father has led you to this place, at this time, and what work He has for you to do? An orphaned Jewish woman named Esther might have had similar questions. Esther’s captivity in Persia placed her in a position to assist the Lord in saving His people, the Jews. This lesson can help students recognize how Heavenly Father places us in situations to help Him accomplish His work. Student preparation: Consider asking students to prayerfully ponder how Heavenly Father might accomplish His work through them in this seminary class or their ward or branch, school, city, or family Possible Learning Activities Divine design Consider beginning class by showing a chessboard and pieces or a picture of a chessboard. Invite students to share what they know about the game of chess. If needed, explain that the game works as players move their pieces into strategic positions to win the game. You could ask students what they think makes a skilled chess player. If students do not mention it, consider sharing that skilled players map out their winning strategy several moves ahead as the game progresses. You could then ask students to think about how our lives could be like a game of chess, sharing Elder Rasband’s explanation. Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught: Our lives are like a chessboard, and the Lord moves us from one place to another—if we are responsive to spiritual promptings. Looking back, we can see His hand in our lives. (“ By Divine Design ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2017, 55) Why do you think it can be easier to notice God’s influence in our lives looking into the past, rather than right now? The account of Esther demonstrates how God’s influence in Esther’s life put her in a position to accomplish His work. In this lesson, you will study the first part of this account. As you study, prayerfully seek the Holy Ghost to help you recognize how Heavenly Father may be placing you in situations to help Him accomplish His work. For such a time as this After the Persians conquered Babylon, many Jews remained in Persia, including Esther and her guardian, Mordecai. The king of Persia, Ahasuerus, became dissatisfied with his wife Vashti and sent her away (see Esther 1:1–12 ). Seeking a new bride, Ahasuerus called for all the women of Persia to be brought before him (see Esther 2:1–4 ). To help students understand the story of Esther, you could organize students into small groups to study one of the following scripture blocks. Invite groups to summarize their part of the story for the class. You may want to think of an interesting way students could summarize their account. They could draw a symbol on a sheet of paper to represent the story (for example, a crown or wedding veil, a royal ring, a sword, or a weeping emoji). Students could act out the story while others narrate it. Read your assigned passage looking for the difficult circumstances Esther and Mordecai faced. Esther 2:5–11, 15–17 Esther 3:1–13 Esther 4:1–9 As students share, be conscious of time so that students do not spend too long summarizing these accounts. How do you think Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ felt about the events in these verses? About Mordecai? About Esther? Read Esther 4:10–14 , looking for how Mordecai helped Esther see the influence Heavenly Father may have had on the circumstances of her life. You may want to have students mark the question “who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” ( verse 14 ). Elder Rasband testified that God does influence the circumstances of our lives to accomplish His work. I know that the Lord will move us on that seeming chessboard to do His work. What may appear to be a random chance is, in fact, overseen by a loving Father in Heaven who can number the hairs of every head. Not even a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father’s notice. The Lord is in the small details of our lives, and those incidents and opportunities are to prepare us to lift our families and others as we build the kingdom of God on earth. … Heavenly Father can put us in situations with specific intent in mind. He has done so in my life, and He is doing so in yours. (“ By Divine Design ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2017, 55–56) What truths can we learn about Heavenly Father from the account of Esther and Elder Rasband? As students share their responses, write a truth on the board using students’ words like Heavenly Father places us in situations where we can help accomplish His work . Note : Esther’s courage to go before the king to save her people will be studied in Lesson 95: “ Esther, Part 2 .” Recognizing Heavenly Father’s guidance It may be helpful to point out that accomplishing the Lord’s work is often not a dramatic experience. It may be small but still significant. For a few examples of these small but significant experiences, you could share either Sister Michelle Craig’s story in “ Eyes to See ” time code 2:23 to 4:54 ( Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 16) or Elder Brook P. Hales account in “ Answers to Prayers ,” time code 2:16 to 4:32. You can find videos of these accounts at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 6:27 12:39 How has the Lord given you or someone you know an opportunity to be an instrument in His hands? Consider sharing an experience when you have recognized opportunities Heavenly Father has given you to help accomplish His work. To help students reflect on how Heavenly Father has placed them in situations to accomplish His work, you could give them time to silently ponder their answers to the following question. They could record their thoughts in their study journal. How do you think Mordecai’s statement in verse 14 might describe you? If you feel students need more help to recognize these opportunities in their lives, you could instead have students complete the following activity. In your study journal, write down the name of someone in your life (family, school, church, or other setting). Then answer at least one of the following in your journal. What evidence have you seen that Heavenly Father has placed that person in your life “for such a time as this?” ( Esther 4:14 )? When have you seen Heavenly Father’s hand placing you around specific people or in certain situations “for such a time as this?” ( Esther 4:14 )? As appropriate, you might invite willing students to share what they wrote with the class. Consider encouraging students to act on any spiritual impressions they may have had during the lesson.\n\n\n--- Lesson 95 ---\nAs followers of Jesus Christ, we all will have times when we need to demonstrate courage, even though our circumstances may be different. Esther demonstrated courage as she relied on the Lord while facing potential death in order to save her people. This lesson can help students act with courage to do the Lord’s will. Student preparation: Invite students to prepare to share an example of when someone they know demonstrated courage to do the Lord’s will Possible Learning Activities A call for courage Consider beginning class by sharing an experience of when someone demonstrated courage, such as in the following story. President Thomas S. Monson shared the following story: 16:18 While serving in the United States Navy in World War II, I learned of brave deeds, instances of valor, and examples of courage. One which I shall never forget was the quiet courage of an 18-year-old seaman—not of our faith—who was not too proud to pray. Of 250 men in the company, he was the only one who each night knelt down by the side of his bunk, at times amidst the jeers of bullies and the jests of unbelievers. With bowed head, he prayed to God. He never wavered. He never faltered. He had courage. (“ Be Strong and of a Good Courage ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2014, 67) Who do you think of when you hear the word courage ? What are situations where Latter-day Saint teenagers might need to demonstrate courage? Ponder a specific situation, such as at school, at home, or with friends, where you feel Heavenly Father might want you to demonstrate greater courage. Write this situation in your study journal. As you study the remainder of the story of Esther, invite the Holy Ghost to help you know how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ can help you face that situation with courage. Esther’s courage To help students share what they remember about the story of Esther, consider displaying a picture of Esther and the following names. Invite students to share what they remember about each person. Esther Mordecai King Ahasuerus Haman Or you could show a video such as “ For Such a Time as This ” from time codes 5:12 to 9:41. This video is available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 13:44 The following summary could be used to add any important details students may have missed. Esther became the queen to King Ahasuerus of Persia. Esther’s guardian, Mordecai, refused to bow to Haman, the king’s chief minister. Haman was angered and received permission from the king to destroy all of the Jews in the kingdom. Mordecai asked Esther to seek intervention from the king, telling her that perhaps God placed her in this position “for such a time as this” ( Esther 4:14 ). If students need help answering the following question, you could invite them to read Esther 4:10–11 . Why would approaching the king require great courage? Read Esther 4:15–17 , looking for how Esther demonstrated courage as she prepared to approach the king. You could also show the remainder of the video “ For Such a Time as This ” from time codes 11:10 to 13:44. 13:44 As you discuss the following questions, it may be helpful to remember that validating students’ comments can help students be more willing to participate in the future. What stands out to you about Esther? What principles can we learn from verses 15–17 that can help us when we need courage? Thank students for the meaningful principles they shared. If not already mentioned, you could help them identify the following principle: As I rely on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, They will give me courage. What evidence do you see that Esther relied on the Lord? How might this have helped her? Courageous acts The following scripture passages can help students see how the Lord continued to bless Esther with courage. Consider organizing students into small groups or pairs. Assign each group or pair one of the following passages of scripture. Or students within the same group could each study one of the passages and prepare to share with each other. Study one of the following passages of scripture, looking for how Esther demonstrated courage. Esther 5:1–4 . Esther approached the king. Esther 7:1–4 . Esther, the king, and Haman held a private banquet. Esther 8:3–6 . Esther discussed with the king his edict to slay the Jews. Then, discuss the following questions: How were Esther’s actions a demonstration of courage? What do you think a person needs to know about God to make the choice Esther made? Invite willing students to share what they discussed with the class. Helping students place Jesus Christ at the center of their learning invites the Holy Ghost to testify of Him. This can help students have a more personal and powerful learning experience. One way we can do this is by connecting the story of Esther to the life and example of Jesus Christ. (For additional training on helping students connect what they are learning to the life and example of Jesus Christ, see “ Emphasize the example of Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills [2022], 5.) Display a picture of Jesus Christ on the board. Consider asking one or both of the following questions. How does Esther remind you of the Savior? What are examples from the Savior’s life where He demonstrated courage? To prepare students to share their own experiences, consider showing students a video such as “ Having Courage and Trusting the Lord ” (3:18), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 3:18 When is a time you, or someone you know, relied on the Lord and were blessed with courage? My personal act of courage The following suggestions can help students apply what they learned from the account of Esther. Reflect on the situation you thought about at the beginning of the lesson. Seek guidance from the Spirit as you ponder how you can demonstrate courage and rely on the Lord in that situation. Read Esther 4:16 again, emphasizing the following statement: “… and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.” To help students emphasize the statement in verse 16 , they could mark or highlight it if desired. Then, consider inviting them to rewrite the statement in their study journal using the prompts below. Reword this statement to reflect your commitment to show courage and rely on the Lord with your situation. To help you do this, consider completing the following prompts: And so I will (the action you would like to do to demonstrate courage). And if (a possible consequence), I (something you will do to rely on the Lord). It might be helpful to provide an example, such as the following: Imagine you feel that Heavenly Father wants you to have the courage to stop using crude and offensive language with your friends. You could reword Esther 4:16 to say: “And so I will not use bad language anymore, even when joking. And if my friends tease or mock me, then I will pray for the strength to keep trying.” Invite willing students to share what they wrote. If time permits, students could share advice with each other regarding the situations they share. Testify of the Lord’s example of courage. Express your belief in your students’ ability to face their challenges with courage as they rely on the Lord to do His will.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 97 ---\nHave you ever struggled to be faithful to God during difficult times? Job was a faithful man who enjoyed a blessed life. Unexpectedly, Job lost his wealth, children, and health. However, Job did not lose his faith in Jesus Christ. This lesson can help students feel an increased desire to trust Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ during trials. Student preparation: Invite students to reflect on how they have responded to their trials. Ask them to come to class prepared to discuss their experiences. Possible Learning Activities Before beginning today’s lesson, it could help to tell students that the next several books ( Job–Song of Solomon ) are known as the books of poetry or wisdom literature. These books are written in poetic form and are not intended to convey history. Like other scripture, these books can point us toward Jesus Christ and help us follow Him. (Note: Joseph Smith described Song of Solomon as “not inspired writings” [ Joseph Smith Translation, note on Song of Solomon ].) How we respond to trials Consider beginning class by writing on the board “Person A” and “Person B.” Invite students to come up with a scenario for each person, one describing a long-term trial and one describing a short-term trial. The following prompts might help. Ever since Person A was a child, they have had to deal with … Today just keeps getting worse for Person B. It started with … After students have established the two scenarios, invite them to discuss the following questions for “Person A” and “Person B.” They could do this in pairs or small groups. What would it look like if this person responded to this trial poorly? What would it look like if this person responded to this trial well? What would it look like if this person responded to this trial with trust in Heavenly Father? After students have had time to discuss, help them think about how they respond to their own trials. The following is one way you could do this. On a scale of 1–5 (1 being not true of you at all and 5 being very true of you), think about how true the following statements are of you: I respond well to trials. I find strength from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ during trials. Be open to feeling or learning things about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that could help you face your trials with increased trust in them. Job’s life Read Job 1:1–3 , looking for what you learn about Job. (Note: the word perfect translates to “whole, complete, having integrity.”) What did you find? You might write students’ answers on the board. Before continuing the story of Job, consider reading or summarizing the following. It is important to understand that Job was a real person (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:10 ), but Job’s life is told using some poetic elements. For example, as Job’s story begins, the Lord and Satan are described as having two conversations. These are not actual interactions between the Lord and Satan but illustrate Satan’s role as our adversary or enemy. They could be a poetic way of preparing the reader for what follows in Job’s life—his afflictions, temptations, and loss of worldly goods. To help students understand the first conversation, you could ask three volunteers to read. One volunteer could read the words of the narrator, another the words of the Lord, and the third the words of Satan. Ask students to read the words without dramatizing them in any way. Consider displaying the following questions for students to think about as they listen. Read Job 1:6–12 , looking for answers to the following questions: What claim did Satan make about Job’s righteousness? What did Satan want to happen to Job? Allow students to share their answers. If needed, help students understand that Satan claimed that Job was only righteous because the Lord blessed him. Satan wanted Job’s blessings taken away to prove that claim. Job’s example For the next part of Job’s story, you could create a chart like the following on the board. You could then organize students into pairs or small groups to complete the chart. Ask groups to discuss the questions that follow. It might be helpful to walk around to help and encourage students. (Note: Boils are painful skin sores. Job “rent” or tore his clothes and shaved his head as signs of mourning.) What did Job suffer? How did Job respond? What did Job suffer? Read Job 1:13–19 ; 2:7 . How did Job respond? Read Job 1:20–22 ; 2:9–10 ; 13:15 ; 23:10 . What stands out to you about Job’s response? What might Job have understood about God to respond the way he did? Students might point out that Job acknowledged his blessings had come from God (see Job 1:21 ), understood that trials are a part of God’s plan (see Job 2:10 ), and knew God was aware of him and that his trials would refine him (see Job 23:10 ). After students complete the activity, help them identify a truth by asking a question like the following. What can we learn from Job’s example that could help us during trials? Among other answers, students might identify something like: we can choose to trust God during our trials. Consider inviting students to find and mark where they see this truth in Job 13:15 . Examples in scripture Think of ways that you can help students increase their trust in Heavenly Father during their trials. One way is to have students look up scriptures in which people explained their reasons for trusting God during a trial. Students could do the following activity. Find an example in the scriptures where someone chose to trust God during their trials. Mark words or phrases that explain why this person trusted God. Prepare to explain how the concepts you marked have helped or could help you trust God. If students need help identifying scripture accounts, you could invite them to search “trust” in Gospel Library. Or you could provide examples such as: Daniel 2:19–23 —Daniel faced King Nebuchadnezzar’s command that all the wise men in the kingdom (including Daniel) would be killed if no one could interpret his dream. 2 Nephi 4:17–23 —Nephi mourned over his own weaknesses and felt inadequate. After sufficient time, invite students to share in small groups or with the class what they found. You could also show students “ Mountains to Climb ” (5:05), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Have them look for what President Eyring shared that could increase their trust in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ during trials. 5:5 Conclusion You might conclude class by inviting students to write themselves a note or to send a text to themselves answering the following question. If they write a note, invite them to fold it up and put it in their pocket or someplace where they will see it later that day. You might play soft instrumental music as students write. What is something you felt today that has helped you want to trust Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ during trials?\n\n\n--- Lesson 98 ---\nIt can be difficult to find hope during challenges, including the death of loved ones. Heavenly Father sent His Son to perform the Atonement, which finished with the Savior’s Resurrection from the tomb. Because of Jesus Christ’s Resurrection, we can have hope. This lesson can help students understand the hope that comes through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to listen to or read the lyrics of the hymn “ I Know That My Redeemer Lives .” They could select a favorite phrase from the hymn that could bring hope to someone going through difficulties. Possible Learning Activities The greatest event in history Display the following question and invite students to discuss it in small groups. What are some events that people might say are the most important in human history? Why? President Ezra Taft Benson (1899–1994) shared the following: The greatest events of history are those that affect the greatest number of people for the longest periods. By this standard, no event could be more important to individuals or nations than the resurrection of the Master. ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson [2014], 94 ) Take a moment to ponder what you know about the Savior’s Resurrection and why it is important to you. You might also think about why the Savior’s Resurrection could be considered the most important event in history. Encourage students to invite the Holy Ghost to help them better understand the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and the hope it can bring. Job’s questions If you taught Lesson 97: “ Job 1–3; 12–13 ,” students could share what they remember about Job’s trials. Or they could read the following paragraph. Job was a righteous man who experienced severe afflictions. He lost all his property, all 10 of his children were killed when a house collapsed on them, and he suffered terrible physical pain. What questions might you have had if you were Job? Read Job 14:7–14 , marking the two questions Job had as he searched for hope in his afflictions. If students need help understanding Job’s question in verse 10 , you could explain that Job is asking, “Where do we go when we die?” When have you heard or asked similar questions? You might encourage students to think about how they would answer Job’s questions. To see how they could answer Job’s question in verse 10 , students could cross-reference or link verse 10 with Alma 40:6, 11–14 . Explain that the Book of Mormon prophet Alma taught that after we die, our spirits dwell in a state of happiness or misery until the Resurrection. Invite students to think about how they might respond to Job’s question in verse 14 . As they ponder, you or a student can read the following statement. Alternatively, you could watch “ Until We Meet Again ,” available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 0:00 to 2:28. 3:40 Arthur Patton, one of President Thomas S. Monson’s (1927–2018) childhood friends, was killed in World War II. President Monson shared his experience visiting Arthur’s home after hearing the news: With a prayer in my heart, I approached the familiar walkway to the Patton home, wondering what words of comfort could come from the lips of a mere boy. The door opened, and Mrs. Patton embraced me as she would her own son. … [After praying together], Mrs. Patton gazed into my eyes and spoke: “Tommy, I belong to no church, but you do. Tell me, will Arthur live again?” (“ Mrs. Patton—The Story Continues ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov 2007, 22) Imagine you were in President Monson’s situation. In your study journal, write a short paragraph to answer Mrs. Patton’s question. Encourage students to add to what they have written as they continue to learn about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. “I know that my Redeemer liveth” Read Job 19:23–27 , looking for the answer Job gives to his questions. What did Job know to be true? Students might share something like because of Jesus Christ, we will be resurrected and see God again . What can verses 23–24 teach us about how Job felt about this truth? How might this knowledge about Jesus Christ have influenced Job as he endured his trials? How can this knowledge help us? Students could read the following statement on their own and then share what stands out to them from it. President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency shared some ways our knowledge of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ can bring us hope: The Resurrection from the dead is the reassuring personal pillar of our faith. It adds meaning to our doctrine, motivation to our behavior, and hope for our future. … The Resurrection gives us the perspective and the strength to endure the mortal challenges faced by each of us and those we love. It gives us a new way to view the physical, mental, or emotional deficiencies we have at birth or acquire during mortal life. It gives us the strength to endure sorrows, failures, and frustrations. Because each of us has an assured resurrection, we know that these mortal deficiencies and oppositions are only temporary. (“ What Has Our Savior Done for Us? ,” Liahona , May 2021, 75) When have you seen someone gain hope through their faith in Jesus Christ and His Resurrection? Understanding the Resurrection Before displaying the following instructions, you might discuss how we can strengthen the words we speak or write by connecting them with the words of the Savior and His prophets. One way we can do this is by quoting phrases from scriptures. Do the following with the paragraph you wrote in response to Mrs. Patton’s question: Add a sentence or two using something you learned or felt today about Jesus Christ and the hope available to us because of His Resurrection. Include a phrase from Job 19:25–27 . Add one or two additional sentences using words or phrases from other scriptures or statements from Church leaders. To do this, you could search “Resurrection” in Gospel Library, Guide to the Scriptures , or Topics and Questions . You could also review pages 48 , 55–56 , and 58 of Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ (2023). If needed, you could provide some of the following references: 1 Corinthians 15:20–22 ; Mosiah 16:7–8 ; Alma 11:42–44 ; Helaman 14:17 ; Moroni 7:41 You might show “ Because of Him ” (2:44), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , and invite students to add to what they wrote. 2:44 When students have finished, place them in small groups. Have the students share with their groups what they wrote about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. As their classmates share, students could add to their own paragraphs. To conclude class, you could watch the remainder of “ Until We Meet Again ,” from time code 2:28 to 3:39, to hear what President Monson said to Mrs. Patton. 3:40\n\n\n--- Lesson 99 ---\nHave you ever wondered why God allows suffering? Are there other questions you have asked during your trials? In vain, Job and his friends tried to determine the reasons for Job’s suffering. While God did not give a reason, He did help Job see his trials in a higher and holier way. This lesson can provide students with an opportunity to help others view their trials with an eternal perspective. Student preparation: Provide students with the question “Why does God allow us to experience trials?” Invite them to find answers using divinely appointed sources, such as the scriptures, teachings from Church leaders, or their parents. They could also ask family members or friends how they would answer the question. Possible Learning Activities Why do bad things happen? Consider beginning class by writing the following questions on the board. Invite the class to create two more questions people might ask while trying to understand their trials. Add these two questions to the board and number them 5 and 6 . These questions will be referenced throughout the lesson. “I must be doing everything wrong. Why else is life so hard for me?” “If I’m following the gospel, why am I not able to avoid trials and suffering?” “I thought God loved me. Why is He making my life so difficult?” “If God is real, why doesn’t He stop peoples’ suffering?” It could help to acknowledge that some students might have asked similar questions during trials. Encourage students to be kind and respectful as they discuss the following question. What are some assumptions people might be making when they ask questions such as these? After the discussion you could invite students to ponder the following question. They could write their responses in their study journals. Do you think you could help someone turn to the Lord and find answers to these types of questions? Why or why not? Studying divinely appointed sources can invite the Holy Ghost into our learning. Pay attention to insights He might teach you as you read the scriptures and statements in this lesson. Consider how these insights could help others answer questions about their trials. Doing so might help you gain greater understanding of your own trials. Job and his friends Consider displaying an image of Job, such as the one at the beginning of this lesson. Invite students to briefly discuss with a partner what they remember about the story of Job. You could then share the following: During Job’s trials he had three friends visit him. Job and his friends tried to determine the reasons for his suffering. Their limited perspective led to inaccurate assumptions. Using the verses below, consider inviting the left side of the class to study what Job believed about his suffering and the right side to study what Job’s friend, Eliphaz, believed. Or you could summarize these verses and move on to the heading “An eternal perspective.” Summarizing would allow more time for students to study the conclusion of Job’s story and to discuss the handout. Read Job 19:6–11 , looking for what Job assumed about God. Read Job 22:5–10 , looking for what Eliphaz assumed about Job. What inaccurate assumptions did each person have? If students need help understanding what they read, you could explain that Job felt God had caused his trials and had abandoned him. Eliphaz falsely accused Job of mistreating others. He believed Job’s suffering was the result of wickedness. An eternal perspective As Job continued struggling through his trials, God spoke to him. God asked Job many questions about the creation of the world, which Job could not answer (see Job 38–41 ). Read Job 38:4–7 , looking for examples of the questions God asked Job. Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained God’s response to Job’s inability to answer Him: It was as if God had patiently and kindly said to Job, “If you cannot answer even one of my questions about the earth that I have created, is it possible that eternal laws exist that you do not understand? Are there assumptions you have made that are invalid? Do you understand my motives and how my plan of salvation and exaltation works? And can you foresee your future destiny?” God in His wisdom knows that a vital part of our mortal experience is to not know everything. There is something about trusting Him that allows us to progress to become like Him. (“ Trust God and Let Him Prevail ,” Liahona , Aug. 2022, 5) What does this statement help you understand about God and trials? As students respond, consider pointing out that God did not provide a reason for Job’s suffering. Read Job 42:1–6 , looking for Job’s response to the Lord. What stands out to you from Job’s response? What have you learned from Job’s story that can help us better understand our trials? Students might identify many truths, including God can help us view our trials with an eternal perspective . Job acknowledged his limited understanding compared with God’s knowledge and Job changed the way he viewed his trials. He came to know his suffering was not a result of sin or divine punishment. God blessed Job greatly at the end of his life (see Job 42:12–13 ). Understanding trials We might not always understand the reasons for our challenges. However, the Lord has provided divine sources that can help us view our trials with an eternal perspective. Consider providing students with the handout titled “ Understanding Trials .” Students could complete this on their own to allow for personal reflection. Or they could study the handout in pairs or small groups to increase comprehension or student engagement. Instead of using the handout, you could invite students to search words such as “adversity” or “trials” in the Gospel Library to gain insights that can help them better understand trials. Open PDF When students complete the handout, consider inviting them to reread the six questions about trials that were written on the board at the beginning of class. You could then lead a class discussion with questions such as the following: What did you learn that could help someone with these questions view their trials with an eternal perspective? How have you seen the teachings you studied be true in your own trials? What are you learning about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you listen to what others are sharing? You could also watch “ Why Do Bad Things Happen to Good People? ” (4:39), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Invite students to look for what Brock learned from his trials. 4:39 Conclusion Allow students to role-play helping others view their trials with an eternal perspective. You could do this by placing students in pairs. Provide each pair with a six-sided die. Display the following instructions. You could modify the instructions if dice are unavailable. Refer to the six questions about trials written on the board as you and your partner complete the following activity: Choose one person to roll the die. If you rolled the die, ask your partner the question on the board that corresponds with the number you rolled. (For example, if you rolled one you would ask, “I must be doing everything wrong. Why else is life so hard for me?” ) If you did not roll the die, answer the question your partner asked. Use insights you gained from class to help your partner view their trials with an eternal perspective. Include thoughts or feelings you have about Heavenly Father or Jesus Christ. Switch responsibilities and repeat the activity one more time. If the same number gets rolled, roll again. Consider concluding by adding your witness to the things students have shared today.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 100 ---\nWhat do your favorite hymns teach you about Jesus Christ? Hymns have allowed musicians and poets to express their feelings about the Savior for centuries. Like many modern hymns, several of the psalms teach and testify of the Savior’s life and mission. This lesson can help students better understand Jesus Christ’s life and mission as prophesied in Psalms. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder how their favorite hymns teach and testify of Jesus Christ. Invite them to prepare to share a favorite hymn about Jesus Christ in class. If students feel they do not have a favorite hymn, invite them to look through the hymn book for songs that teach about Jesus Christ. Possible Learning Activities Hymns that teach of Jesus Christ Using sacred music in class can create a feeling of reverence, invite the Holy Ghost, and increase feelings of unity. Music can also be used to connect the message of hymns to the truths students are learning. You might use sacred music to begin this lesson. One way is to invite students to search Hymns (1985) or Hymns—for Home and Church (2026) . Invite students to select a hymn under the topic “ Jesus Christ .” Give students a moment to read and reflect on the lyrics of that hymn. You might point out the authors’ names and scripture references underneath the music and lyrics. Display the following questions and invite students to share their answers with a partner. (For additional training on using sacred music in class, see “ Create settings and opportunities for learners to be taught by the Holy Ghost ” in Teacher Development Skills .) What can we learn about the Savior and His life from the words of this hymn? Is there another hymn about the Savior that has special meaning to you? If so, why? As you study today, invite the Holy Ghost to help you feel the power of words and music that teach and testify of Jesus Christ. The book of Psalms The book of Psalms is a collection of prayers, poems, and hymns that is similar in some ways to our modern hymnbook. Invite students to turn to the book of Psalms . Give students two to three minutes to scan through some of the psalms, looking for an overall impression. As you scan through the book, what do you notice about Psalms that makes it unique? What questions do you have about this book? Quickly look through Psalm 3 , marking each time you find the word Selah . While the meaning of Selah is not certain, it may have been a signal to the singer or reader to pause and reflect (like a musical rest). Read Psalm 3 , pausing each time you read the word Selah . Invite the Holy Ghost to help you ponder these verses. Why might the author have wanted us to pause and reflect in these places? How might pondering in one or more of these places help or comfort a teenager today? Depending on your class’s questions and experience, you could briefly point out some or all of the following: Many of the psalms are attributed to specific authors like David ( Psalm 3 ). Other psalms have no known author (see Psalm 1 ). Hebrew poetic elements are found throughout Psalms. Parallelism is poetry where two or more lines share connected ideas (see Psalm 29:4 ). Repetition is a Hebrew poetic tool that emphasizes a line by repeating it (such as “Praise him” in Psalm 150 ). In the Hebrew language, Psalm 119 is an example of an acrostic poem. Acrostic poems use the first letter of each line to spell out words or the Hebrew alphabet.. The book of Psalms is quoted in the New Testament over 115 times (see Psalms 6:8 and Luke 13:27 ). After the Last Supper, Jesus and His disciples sang a hymn (see Matthew 26:30 ). This was possibly Psalms 113–118 , the “Hallel,” the hymn traditionally sung at Passover (see Merrill J. Bateman, “ The Power of Hymns ,” Ensign , July 2001, 17). Read Luke 24:44 , looking for what the Savior taught His disciples about the psalms shortly after His Resurrection. In speaking of one of the most important messages found in the book of Psalms, President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught: Jesus Himself quoted the book of Psalms more than any other Old Testament text. … It could be argued that in all of holy writ, no book of scripture goes on so extensively about the Messianic mission or the looking and longing for His return that is expressed in the songs of the Psalmist. ( For Times of Trouble: Spiritual Solace from the Psalms [2012], 7–8) What did you learn from Luke 24:44 and from President Holland? Why is it worth studying the book of Psalms? Help students recognize that we can learn about the life and mission of Jesus Christ by studying the psalms . Consider writing this truth on the board. Psalms that prophesy of Jesus Christ To help students understand some of the prophetic statements in Psalms about Jesus Christ’s life and mission, provide some or all of the scripture references below. The following are a few ways you might have your class study these verses: Write the verse pairs on strips of paper and place each paper around the room. Give students time to walk around the room and read several of the prophecies and fulfillments. Mix up the scripture pairs and invite students to match the prophecies in Psalms with their fulfillments. Display only the Psalms verses. Invite students to use the footnotes and other scripture study tools to find references from the Savior’s life that fulfill each prophecy. Psalms that prophesy of Jesus Christ Prophesy fulfilled Psalms that prophesy of Jesus Christ Psalm 22:1 Prophesy fulfilled Matthew 27:46 Psalms that prophesy of Jesus Christ Psalm 22:7–8 Prophesy fulfilled Matthew 27:41–43 Psalms that prophesy of Jesus Christ Psalm 22:16 Prophesy fulfilled Doctrine and Covenants 6:36–37 Psalms that prophesy of Jesus Christ Psalm 22:18 Prophesy fulfilled John 19:23–24 Psalms that prophesy of Jesus Christ Psalm 31:5 Prophesy fulfilled Luke 23:46 Psalms that prophesy of Jesus Christ Psalm 34:20 Prophesy fulfilled John 19:31–36 Psalms that prophesy of Jesus Christ Psalm 41:9 Prophesy fulfilled Luke 22:47–48 ; Acts 1:16–17 Psalms that prophesy of Jesus Christ Psalm 69:20–21 Prophesy fulfilled John 19:28–29 Psalms that prophesy of Jesus Christ Psalm 118:22 Prophesy fulfilled Acts 4:10–12 Think of a situation that you or a loved one faces where it is helpful to know something you learned about the Savior’s life or mission from these prophecies. Record your thoughts in your study journal. To help students visualize the fulfilment of some of the prophecies, you could show a video depicting moments from the Savior’s life. For example, you could use “ My Kingdom Is Not of This World ,” time code 0:00 to 3:18, from ChurchofJesusChrist.org . This video illustrates prophecies in Psalm 22:1, 7–8, 16 . 5:25 As students watch the video, invite them to raise their hands when they recognize an event prophesied in Psalms. Consider pausing the video and inviting students to share what they would want someone to understand about this moment in the Savior’s life. The life of Jesus Christ Invite students to demonstrate their understanding of the Savior’s life and mission as prophesied in Psalms. One option is to invite students to discuss the following questions with a partner, small group, or the class. Select one of the prophecies from Psalms that you found particularly meaningful. What does this prophecy teach you about Jesus Christ? Why is what you learned about Him important to know? Consider sharing your witness of the life and mission of Jesus Christ. You could invite students to continue to look for references to Jesus Christ as they study the book of Psalms throughout the next few weeks. It might be appropriate to conclude class by singing or listening to a hymn about the Savior, as chosen by the students. In Lesson 101: “ Introduction to the Psalms, Part 2 ,” students will create an expression of their love and devotion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as the Psalmists did. Consider inviting students to start thinking about this now. Ask them to ponder how they feel about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and how they would express those feelings.\n\n\n--- Lesson 101 ---\nOne way to worship Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ is to express your love and devotion to Them. Many of the Psalms are poetic examples of worshipping the Father and Son in praises, pleadings, and prayers. This lesson can help students express their feelings of worship for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Let students know they will have an opportunity to reflect on their thoughts and feelings about Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and sacred things in preparation to share those feelings in this lesson. Encourage students to listen to reverent music and review favorite scriptures, quotes, or sacred images, looking for specific things they might want to share. Doing this can prepare their hearts and minds for the activity in this lesson. Possible Learning Activities Worshipping God Note: The activity at the end of this lesson will be part of the reflection in Lesson 112: “ Assess Your Learning 7 .” Be sure to allow plenty of time for students to begin working on the activity during class. To begin class, give students a minute to ponder the following question: What does “worshipping God” mean to you? Elder Dean M. Davies, then serving in the Presiding Bishopric, shared some ways we can worship God when he taught: When we worship God, we approach Him with reverent love, humility, and adoration. We acknowledge and accept Him as our sovereign King, the Creator of the universe, our beloved and infinitely loving Father. We respect and revere Him. We submit ourselves to Him. We lift our hearts in mighty prayer, cherish His word, rejoice in His grace, and commit to follow Him with dedicated loyalty. (“ The Blessings of Worship ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2016, 94) How would you describe the difference between simply attending church, the temple, or seminary compared to worshipping God as you attend? Briefly share with students one or two of your favorite ways that people have expressed their feelings of worship for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Examples include a poem, video, work of art, piece of writing, or piece of sacred music. You could include things that you wrote or created yourself. Explain to students that there are many ways someone can express feelings of worship for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Encourage students to reflect on how they might express their feelings of worship for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Throughout the lesson, be mindful of and sensitive to students who might not feel a connection to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ right now. In your study journal, select one or more of the following questions to answer. You could use some of Elder Davies’s message or your own words to summarize your feelings. How do you feel about Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and sacred things? How do you best express love, respect, or reverence for Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, or spiritual blessings? At the end of the lesson today, you will begin creating an expression of your feelings. Keep this in mind as you study. Think about how you might want to express what you learn and feel. Invite the Holy Ghost to assist you in your efforts. Worshipping the Lord in the psalms Many psalms are the poetic, prayerful expressions of the sacred thoughts, feelings, hopes, and desires of the writers. While many scriptures record the Lord’s words to us, the psalms frequently reflect the writers’ words to Him. Read Psalm 18:1–6 , looking for words and phrases David used to express his feelings about the Lord. Invite students to write the words and phrases they discovered on the board. Students might identify several different phrases, such as: The Lord is my strength ( verse 1 ). The Lord is my rock, fortress, deliverer, God, strength, buckler, horn of salvation, or high tower ( verse 2 ). The Lord is worthy to be praised ( verse 3 ). The Lord hears our cries to Him ( verse 6 ). Students who wrote phrases could share why David might have wanted his audience to know this about the Lord. Consider asking the students how the Lord has fulfilled these roles in their lives. Invite students to choose one of the following passages to study with a partner. Encourage them to pause often and share with each other their thoughts and feelings. The psalms demonstrate many ways we can share our feelings for the Lord. Study one of the following passages slowly, marking words and phrases that reflect your feelings about the Lord. Psalm 8:1–9 Psalm 27:1–9 Psalm 30:1–12 Psalm 46:1–11 Consider showing students ways other than writing to express worship. You could select a video that expresses feelings for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ through dance, music, or art, such as the following videos available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Invite students to ponder what they think the creators were expressing through the lyrics, paintings, and so on. Dance: “ Trust in the Lord: Music Video ” (4:11) Music: “ Here I Am, I Will Follow Jesus Christ ” (3:07) or “ Peace in Christ ” (4:09) Art: Sister Kristin M. Yee shares her painting of the Savior on Facebook ( https://www.facebook.com/reel/1240140883346653?mibextid=kcDB8O ) 4:11 4:10 Express your feelings of worship Give students the remaining class time to begin to create something that reflects how they feel about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Evaluate your students’ needs, and display some or all of the following options. You could provide art supplies like paper, colored pencils, markers, and so on for students who wish to create a visual representation of their feelings. Because this is an individual project, you could walk around the room and offer help, guidance, and encouragement as needed. If appropriate, consider playing soft, sacred music during the activity. It might help to express your love and confidence to any students who might be struggling with their thoughts or feelings about the Lord. Activity 6 could be a good option for students who are still unsure about their faith. Take some time to express your thoughts and feelings about Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and sacred things. Use one of the following options, or design one of your own. You might not have time to finish your work in class today, but you could begin to compose a song or poem or conceptualize a drawing or video. You could continue to work on your expression outside of class. You might choose to include a scripture from Psalms that you have found meaningful. Compose a poem or a song that expresses your feelings about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Make a video or an audio recording where you share your feelings about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. For a video, you could include favorite sacred images from Gospel Library. Psalmists often compared the Savior to something else to show what He meant to them. Examples include “The Lord is my rock, and my fortress” ( Psalm 18:2 ) and “The Lord is my light” ( Psalm 27:1 ). Make a list of things in your life that could represent how you feel about the Lord. Create a drawing, painting, meme, illustration, or other work of art that reflects your feelings about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Search for multiple sacred images and create a collage. Choose images that represent things about Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the gospel that are important to you. Make a note for each image summarizing your thoughts and feelings. Write your thoughts about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. You might want to share an experience that has impacted how you feel about Them. You might allow students to share what they created today. You could make time for students to share their work during future lessons after they have completed their creations. Consider inviting students to add to what they are creating as they continue to learn about Jesus Christ during the next several lessons. Tell students that they will reflect on this creative experience in Lesson 112: “ Assess Your Learning 7 .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 102 ---\nPausing to visualize descriptions and comparisons in scripture passages can bring beauty and power to the words we read. In Psalm 23 , King David described his relationship with Jesus Christ through a series of images that depict the Savior’s love and care. This lesson can help students feel the tender, loving character of Christ through visualizing scriptural images. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder how things they see every day remind them of the Savior. For example, “Rain reminds me of the Savior because …”. Then invite them to read Psalm 23 and choose a favorite comparison that David made to the Savior or to what the Savior does for us. Possible Learning Activities Visualizing scriptural imagery To help students practice learning from scriptural imagery, consider beginning class by displaying a picture of someone mourning and someone dancing. Then, ask your students what thoughts or feelings come to mind when they think of mourning. Students might share things like tears, losing someone, pain, or sadness. Repeat the same question for dancing. Read Psalm 30:11 , looking for how David used the images of mourning and dancing to describe the power of Jesus Christ and His Atonement. How do these pictures help you understand what David was taught about Jesus Christ when he said, “Thou has turned for me my mourning into dancing”? Explain to students that using these pictures to better understand verse 11 is an example of the study skill visualizing . Consider inviting a student to read the following description of this study skill. Visualizing is a study skill that creates a mental picture from descriptive details in the scriptures. We can imagine being present at events described in the scriptures. We can pause and picture phrases like “Thou has turned for me my mourning into dancing” ( Psalm 30:11 ). The next step is pondering what we can learn from the images. Doing so can invite the Holy Ghost as we slow down and seek to understand with our mind and heart. Reflect on the following questions. How often do you slow down to visualize what you are studying in the scriptures? How do you think slowing down to visualize what you read can help you come to know the Savior better? Pay attention to the promptings of the Holy Ghost to help you learn about Jesus Christ as you visualize the descriptions in Psalm 23 today. “The Lord is my Shepherd” This section of the lesson gives students an opportunity to practice visualizing together as a class before trying it on their own. Read Psalm 23:1 and mark the image used to describe Jesus Christ. To help students learn more about the Savior, you might invite them to visualize Him as our Shepherd while they read Ezekiel 34:11–16 or John 10:11–15 , or as the class sings “ Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd ” ( Hymns , no. 221). They may also want to cross-reference or link those passages to Psalm 23:1 . Take a minute to try to imagine or visualize a shepherd taking care of or protecting their sheep. Then write down a statement about Jesus Christ that you learn from visualizing Him as your Shepherd. Consider displaying on the board a picture of Jesus Christ depicted as a shepherd like the one at the beginning of this lesson. Invite a few students to write their statements of truth about Him on the board around the picture. Students might share statements like: The Lord cares about my needs. How has Jesus Christ been a shepherd in your life or in the lives of those around you? Coming to know Jesus Christ Consider giving students a chance to come to know the Savior better by practicing visualization on their own or in small groups. The following activity is one way to do this. Before students begin, give each student a blank sheet of paper. You may also want to provide colored pencils or markers that students could use to draw pictures. Study Psalm 23:2–6 . Then choose one verse that stands out to you to focus on for the remainder of this activity. Visualize the imagery King David used in your verse to describe a characteristic of Jesus Christ or something He does for us. Draw a picture of what you’re visualizing or find a digital image that could represent what you picture in your mind. Write at least one statement of truth on your paper about the Savior that you learn from visualizing David’s description. Personalize what you learned by pondering (or discussing with your group) why it matters to you or how it can strengthen your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. As students work, consider walking around the room to learn from them and help those who may need it. If students struggle to visualize the image, you could ask questions like “What does it feel like to be beside still water?” or “What do you think His rod and staff might represent?” Additionally, complimenting students’ drawings or insights can be a great way to encourage them and strengthen your relationships with them. Students might write statements of truth about the Savior such as: The Lord restores weary and broken souls ( verse 3 ) or The Lord will nourish us, even during difficult situations ( verse 5 ). After students complete the activity, invite them to share what they learned about Jesus Christ. To do this, they could display their pictures around the room, share what they learned with other students or other groups, or add what they learned to the board. Consider asking questions like the following after students have shared. Is there anything you learned about Jesus Christ that you might have missed if you hadn’t slowed down to visualize the imagery in Psalm 23 ? If so, what? Which of these images help you see the tender, loving character of Jesus Christ the most? Why? You might end by encouraging students to use visualization in their scripture study to continue to come to know the Savior better. Consider sharing your testimony of the truths about Jesus Christ taught in Psalm 23 .\n\n\n--- Lesson 103 ---\nTemples are holy places that are clean and pure. They can help us imagine what it will be like to be in the presence of the Lord. In Psalm 24 , King David invites us to strive to be spiritually clean and pure so we can enter the Lord’s temple and His presence someday. This lesson can help students prepare to worthily enter the temple and eventually dwell in the presence of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to review the temple recommend questions, thinking about their own spiritual preparation to attend the temple. These questions can be found in the appendix of For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022]. Possible Learning Activities Dirty or clean? To prepare students to study Psalm 24 , consider displaying a picture of a muddy teenager. You could also bring mud in a bowl and invite some students to put their hands in it. Then adapt the question below by asking the students how they feel. When was the last time you were very muddy or dirty? How did you feel? Consider displaying a picture of the inside of a temple. If your students have not been inside a temple, consider adjusting the following question to ask how they imagine they would feel inside a temple. How do you feel when you enter the temple? Consider displaying the picture of the muddy teenager alongside the picture from the temple. How would you feel if you were very muddy inside the temple? Why? What spiritual lessons can we learn from this? Ponder how you might feel if you stood in the presence of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ while being spiritually muddy or dirty. Then ponder how you might feel standing in Their presence after having been made spotless through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. In your study journal, answer the following questions: How important is it for you to be temple worthy? Why? How important is it for you to someday dwell with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Why? Seek guidance from the Holy Ghost to help you know what the Lord would have you do to worthily worship Him in the temple and someday enter His and Heavenly Father’s presence. “The hill of the Lord” To begin studying Psalm 24 , consider creating a simple drawing of a hill on the board. Students could draw the same in their journals. Read or summarize the paragraph below. In Psalm 24 , King David used imagery of a hill. Some scripture passages use mountains or hills as symbols of temples (see Isaiah 2:2–3 ). It is possible that David was referring to the temple, or the presence of God, or both. You may want to include on the top of your hill a simple drawing of a temple and the words Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ . You could draw a stick figure at the bottom of the hill that represents us. Read Psalm 24:3–6 , looking for what we should do to prepare to enter the temple and return to the Lord’s presence someday. Psalm 24:3–4 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. After students read the verses, they may have questions about some of the words or phrases. Invite students to ask any questions they or someone in general might have as they read this passage. If helpful, explain that “vanity” refers to pride or arrogance. The phrase “nor sworn deceitfully” could refer to being honest with oneself, others, and God. Consider writing students’ responses to the following question on the board along the edge of the hill. Your final drawing could look similar to the image below. What did you learn from these verses about preparing to enter the temple and returning to the Lord’s presence someday? As students share what they found in verses 3–6 , help them identify the following truth: We must prepare ourselves spiritually to worship the Lord in His temple and to dwell in His presence. Why do you think we need to be spiritually prepared to enter the Lord’s temples and eventually His presence? How could the Lord’s requirements to be spiritually prepared be evidence of His love for us? Spiritually preparing Consider displaying the following instructions and inviting students to complete them individually in their study journal or with a partner. Choose one of the following phrases from Psalm 24:4 you would like to learn more about. clean hands pure heart not lifted up his soul unto vanity (humility) nor sworn deceitfully (honesty) Find scriptures or statements from Church leaders that help you better understand the phrase. Then answer the following questions: Why do you think this aspect of preparation is important to worship in the temple and to dwell with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ someday? What are specific ways a Latter-day Saint teenager could work on that aspect of preparation? What would you want to share about the Savior with a friend who struggles with that aspect of preparation? If students need help, you could suggest scripture passages such as the following: clean hands ( Doctrine and Covenants 88:86 ) pure heart ( Mosiah 5:2 ) not lifted up his soul unto vanity ( Doctrine and Covenants 112:10 ) nor sworn deceitfully ( Alma 27:27 ) You may want to direct them to the Topical Guide , Guide to the Scriptures , or Gospel Library . You could also provide Elder Bednar’s quote from Additional Resources in this lesson. Invite students to share what they learned with another student or partnership who studied a different phrase. You then could ask a few students to share with the class. My personal preparation To prepare your students to make a personal goal, consider showing a video like “ Standing in Holy Places ” (5:36), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Students could be invited to look for ways the young lady prepared herself to worthily attend the temple. 5:36 Students may also benefit from hearing each other’s experiences. For example, they could share how they feel inside the temple or how holding a temple recommend blesses their life. Reflect on how you are doing with your own spiritual preparation. Ponder what you feel Heavenly Father is pleased with and areas where you could improve. Answer the following questions in your study journal. What do you feel Heavenly Father wants you to do to prepare yourself for the temple and for living with Him someday? How can you rely on the Savior for help? Consider sharing your testimony of the truths students studied. Reassure students of the Savior’s ability to cleanse and help them. You may want to share the following statement to conclude the lesson. President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency shared the following: My hope for you and for all your beloved family is that you will grow in desire and determination to be worthy to go into the house of the Lord as often as your circumstances allow. He wants to welcome you there. (“ I Love to See the Temple ,” Liahona , May 2021, 31) Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Psalm 24:3–4 is “Who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 104 ---\nDavid wrote a psalm expressing his desire to be forgiven for the sins he committed. He demonstrated his desire to sincerely repent. This lesson can help students understand that as they repent, the Savior can make them clean. Student preparation: Invite students to imagine themselves in the following situation: Imagine a friend of yours shares that they know they need to repent but wonder how. What would you want them to understand about repentance and the Savior’s role in overcoming sin? Possible Learning Activities Repentance The following activity provides students with an opportunity to reflect on their current understanding of repentance. You may want to display the instructions. Imagine that the following anonymous question from a youth was included in this month’s edition of For the Strength of Youth magazine: “I recently committed some very serious sins that I feel really bad about. I’m not really sure how to repent. To be honest, I am even wondering if I am beyond repentance. Any help?” In your study journal, using what you know about repentance, record what you feel would be helpful for this person to know and understand. As students read the anonymous question and record their responses, they may have additional questions that come to mind. You could invite them to write down any other questions they might have about repentance. Help them know that during the lesson they will have opportunities to study more about repentance. Testify that the Spirit can give them answers to their questions about repentance as they prayerfully seek answers through their study both in and out of class. Sincere repentance Ask students what they know about King David. You could ask them to share some of the great things he did as well as some of the sins he committed. Share any of the following context with students that they don’t mention in their summary. David “was guilty of grave crimes; but … he was capable of true contrition and was therefore able to find forgiveness, except in the murder of Uriah” (Bible Dictionary, “ David ”, see also Doctrine and Covenants 42:18 ). In Psalm 51 , David recorded a psalm to God in which he expressed his feelings of remorse following his sin with Bathsheba (see 2 Samuel 11–12 ). David’s humility and heartfelt desire to be restored to God’s grace and acceptance demonstrate the attitude of one who is seeking to truly repent. Students could first study Psalm 51 on their own looking for what they learn about repentance; then you could provide them with a way to share what they discovered and learned. Here are some instructions you could display for students to follow. You can adapt any of these instructions to better meet the needs and abilities of your students. Study Psalm 51:1–19 on your own looking for what we can learn from David’s psalm about (1) God, or (2) repentance. Mark what you find. Identify three phrases you marked and do one of the following: Write a statement of truth that the phrase is teaching about God or repentance. Find a cross-reference that confirms or deepens your understanding of what the phrase means. Find a quote from a Church leader that can help with understanding. Write a question about the phrase. One way you could help students prepare to share is to list 1–19 on the board. Invite students to write their names next to the verse numbers that contain a phrase they would be willing to share a cross-reference, quote, or question about. Once they have finished, you can invite students to share. As students share, you may want to list statements of truth on the board. Below is some content you may want to share as part of the discussion. The scriptures and statements are organized by verse grouping and bolded truths. Seek to follow any promptings of the Spirit you may receive about what to share or what to ask. Psalm 51:1–2, 7, 9 : God has power to cleanse me from my sin. Isaiah 1:18 President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles testified: [H]owever many mistakes you feel you have made … or however far from home and family and God you feel you have traveled, I testify that you have not traveled beyond the reach of divine love. It is not possible for you to sink lower than the infinite light of Christ’s Atonement shines. (“ Laborers in the Vineyard ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2012, 33) Psalm 51:3–4 : Acknowledging our sin before God is necessary for repentance. Mosiah 26:29–30 Doctrine and Covenants 58:42–43 The General Handbook explains: Repentance requires that sins be confessed to Heavenly Father. … When Church members commit serious sins, their repentance also includes confession to their bishop or stake president. He is then able to exercise the keys of the gospel of repentance on their behalf (see Doctrine and Covenants 13:1 ; 84:26–27 ; 107:18, 20 ). This helps them heal and return to the gospel path through the power of the Savior’s Atonement. … Voluntary confession shows that a person desires to repent. ( General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 32.4.1, Gospel Library) Psalm 51:10–12 : As we repent, God can help us change, feel joy, and have the Holy Ghost with us. Mosiah 4:2–3 President Russell M. Nelson taught: When we choose to repent, we choose to change! We allow the Savior to transform us into the best version of ourselves. We choose to grow spiritually and receive joy—the joy of redemption in Him. When we choose to repent, we choose to become more like Jesus Christ! (“ We Can Do Better and Be Better ,” Liahona , May 2019, 67) Psalm 51:16–17 : I must have a broken and contrite heart and spirit to truly repent before God. 3 Nephi 9:19–20 Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained: To have a broken heart is to be humble, repentant, and meek, eagerly receptive to the will of God. A contrite spirit puts one’s own interests in the hands of God, believing that His will, not our own, will help us become who we should become. ( The Divine Gift of Forgiveness [2019], 153) Explain repentance To help students demonstrate their understanding of sincere repentance and the Savior’s role in it, invite them to review what they have learned in class today. Look back at what you wrote at the beginning of class about the question in the For the Strength of Youth magazine. Using what you have learned today about sincere repentance, add two or three sentences to your initial response. Consider inviting a few willing students to share how they would respond to the question. Encourage students to share their message with a friend or family member they feel would be blessed to hear it. Consider concluding class by inviting students to turn to the Savior through repentance and testifying of His power to make us clean as we repent.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 105 ---\nYou can probably think of moments in your life when you desired to draw near to Heavenly Father. Many of the Psalms are heartfelt prayers that provide an example of approaching Heavenly Father in humble faith. Prayer is a powerful tool that allows anyone at any time to call upon God for comfort, strength, or guidance. As with many tools, we can learn to use prayer more effectively. This lesson will help students communicate more meaningfully with Heavenly Father through prayer. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to pay attention between now and the next class to how they feel they are connecting with Heavenly Father in their prayers. Possible Learning Activities Careful versus casual Before class, write “ careful ” and “ casual ” on the board. Make sure students understand the following definitions of these words. Careful : done with thought or attention. Casual : relaxed or unconcerned. Consider organizing students into pairs or small groups to share what they think it would look like to be careful or casual in the following activities. Alternatively, you could invite partnerships or groups to come up with things they are careful about and things they are casual about. Playing a sport Learning an instrument School work After students have had a chance to share, write “ prayer ” on the board. What might it look like to be careful or casual in prayer? Invite students to think about how they currently approach their own prayers. The following is one way to do this. Assure students that they will not share their answers with anyone else. Silently consider your responses to the following questions: Would you consider your prayers to be more careful or casual? Why? How might you be blessed if your prayers were more careful and meaningful? The previous questions can help students think about their current life circumstances. When learners see how what they are learning relates to their life circumstances, they are more likely to apply the Savior’s teachings in their lives. You can help students find personal relevance by providing prompts that help students think about their current life circumstances. (For additional training on creating relevant learning experiences, see “ Help learners find personal relevance in the doctrine of Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills [2022].) You might invite students to ask questions they may have about prayer. Many of the psalms are heartfelt prayers that provide an example of approaching Heavenly Father in humble faith. As you study these psalms, be sensitive to thoughts and feelings from the Holy Ghost about how to communicate more meaningfully with Heavenly Father through prayer. The psalms can teach us about prayer To help students understand ways they can communicate more meaningfully with Heavenly Father in prayer, consider displaying the following scripture passages and questions on the board. Students could read a passage, then think about how it answers one or more of the questions. It could be helpful to quietly play instrumental music as students study. Read at least three of the following scripture passages, looking for answers to one or more of the questions that follow. Psalm 55:16–17 Psalm 61:1–3 Psalm 63:1–7 Psalm 69:13–18 Psalm 86:3–12 When should I pray to Heavenly Father? How can I be more careful in my prayers? What should my attitude be like when approaching Heavenly Father in prayer? Invite students to share what they discovered. As part of the discussion, write the following incomplete statement on the board: Our prayers to Heavenly Father can become more meaningful as we … Ask students to complete the statement with what they learned about prayer from the psalms they read. Some examples of what students might say include: pray at any time of the day (see Psalm 55:16–17 ). pray when we feel overwhelmed (see Psalm 61:2 ). pray for deliverance (see Psalm 69:13–18 ). pray for mercy (see Psalm 86:3–5 ). pray with an attitude of love, reverence, and praise (see Psalm 63:4–6 ; 86:8–13 ). Praying with love and reverence for Heavenly Father This portion of the lesson focuses on this truth: Our prayers to Heavenly Father can become more meaningful as we pray with an attitude of love, reverence, and praise. One way we can pray to Heavenly Father with an attitude of greater love and reverence is through the tone and language of our prayer. President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency taught: The special language of prayer follows different forms in different languages, but the principle is always the same. We should address prayers to our Heavenly Father in words which speakers of that language associate with love and respect and reverence and closeness. … … We wish to follow the Savior’s teaching, “When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.” [ Matthew 6:7 ; see also 3 Nephi 13:7 .] Our prayers should be simple, direct, and sincere. (“ The Language of Prayer ,” Ensign , May 1993, 16) You might explain that we can show love, respect, and reverence to Heavenly Father by addressing Him using the words thee, thou, thy, and thine. See “ The Language of Prayer ,” Ensign , May 1993, for more information. Think about the language you use in your prayers and how it reflects your feelings for Heavenly Father. Why might it be worth the effort to use respectful and reverent language in your prayers? Read Matthew 6:5–13 looking for how Jesus Christ exemplified love and reverence to Heavenly Father in prayer. What do you learn from the Savior’s teachings and example that can influence the way you pray? How has sincere prayer blessed your life? Application The following diagram can help students think about ways to apply what they learned about prayer. Invite students to draw the diagram in their journals. Then invite them to write answers to the questions in the graphic in each section. Help students to recognize that what they wrote are things they can start applying today. Invite them to act on one or two of the things they wrote. If students are able, you might invite them to take a picture of their graphic to remember what they wrote down. Consider sharing your testimony of how we can communicate with Heavenly Father in meaningful ways through prayer.\n\n\n--- Lesson 107 ---\nDo you feel that your scripture study leads to guidance from the Lord? Psalm 119 expresses gratitude for the word of God and testifies of its power. This lesson can help students make a plan to study the word of God. Student preparation: Invite students to personally study the scriptures before next class. Ask them to ponder if they feel the Lord’s guidance through their scripture study. If so, can they think of any examples? Possible Learning Activities Guidance and the scriptures To prepare students to study about the scriptures, invite them to ponder how different people have different attitudes toward the scriptures. Ask students to consider how these different people might finish the following statement. You could also use this activity as student preparation. You could share the statement before class and invite students to bring an object that would help finish it. Scriptures are like because . If students need an example, you could say, “Scriptures are like a map or a GPS because they guide me.” Invite students to share their thoughts. You might ask why some people love studying the scriptures but others do not. Consider inviting students to ponder how they could complete the statement to reflect their attitude toward the scriptures. At the end of the lesson, you will evaluate your scripture study goal or make a new one. Consider saying a silent prayer for Heavenly Father to guide you today as you study Psalm 119 . Seek inspiration to make the goal that would best help you. The word of God is like … The writer of Psalm 119 used symbols to describe the word of God. These symbols emphasized the psalmist’s love for God’s word and the blessings that come through diligently studying and obeying His words. For example, read Psalm 119:105–106 , looking for what the psalmist compared to the word of God. Consider dimming or turning off the lights in the room and turning on a lamp or flashlight. Allow students to share what they found. How is the word of God like a light or lamp? If students share something such as the following principle, write it on the board: As we study the word of God, He blesses us with guidance. If students need more help identifying the principle, consider asking, “How is walking in the light different from walking in the dark?” or “How can scriptures help us walk in the light?” Or you could write the principle and ask, “How do these verses illustrate the principle on the board?” Turn the lights in the room back on. Consider inviting students to cross-reference or link Psalm 119:105 to 2 Nephi 32:3 . Ask students to note how these verses are similar. Or watch “ How I #HearHim: Elder David A. Bednar ” (1:15), Gospel Library. 1:16 Read or display the following questions, and invite a few students to each select one and answer it: Why do you think God wants to guide us? How could knowing that God can guide us through the scriptures motivate someone to study them? When has the word of God been like a lamp or light to you or someone you know? As students share their answers, you could ask how these ideas and experiences have affected their relationship with God. Other symbols The psalmist made other comparisons. ( Note: the psalmist referred to the word of God by various terms such as testimonies, statutes, law, precepts, commandments, and ways.) To help students study Psalm 119 , write the following references on the board: Psalm 119:14–16, 72, 127 Psalm 119:22–24 Psalm 119:33–35 Psalm 119:50–52, 54 Psalm 119:102–104 Divide the class into five groups and assign each group one of the references on the board. Display the following objects or pictures of these objects: a hymnbook, coins (or something representing riches), honey (or something sweet), a picture of a path, and a picture of a counselor (for example, a counselor in the First Presidency of the Church or a school counselor). Display the following instructions: Read your assigned scripture passage, looking for what the psalmist compared to the word of God. Take the object or picture that corresponds to your assigned scripture passage. Discuss how the object or picture could help someone understand the importance of the word of God. Share examples or experiences from your life, the lives of others, or the scriptures that illustrate how the object or picture is like the word of God. Invite students to finish the following principle according to what they studied: As we study the word of God, He blesses us with … Some possible answers are joy (see verses 14, 16, 35, 103 ), comfort (see verses 50, 52 ), counsel (see verse 24 ), and understanding (see verse 104 ). How could the principle you found help someone want to study the word of God? How has God blessed you or people you know with joy, comfort, counsel, or understanding as you or they studied His word? As students share their answers to the previous question, you could ask how these experiences have affected their relationship with God. Your goal Invite the Spirit as you reflect on your scripture study. If you already have a scripture study goal, record in your study journal what has gone well and what you might want to continue. You might include why you chose this goal and how it helps you feel closer to the Lord. Prayerfully ask Heavenly Father if He would want you to make any adjustments to your goal. If you do not have a current scripture study goal, seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost as you make one. You might include the following: The amount of time you will study How often you will study (if possible, strive to study daily) What you will do to seek the Lord’s help with your study (for example, pray before you study or seek revelation about what you study) How you can remember, meditate on, or apply what you learn (for example, keep a journal of what you are learning from your scripture study, keep a record of what you are trying to apply, or discuss with someone else what you are learning once a week) Invite volunteers to share their scripture study goal as well as any concerns they might have. If students share concerns, invite the class to share scriptures, statements from Church leaders, or personal experiences that might help. Tell students that in “ Assess Your Learning 7 ,” they will have the opportunity to report on their goals. They will share how their scripture study is going and what blessings they feel the Lord is giving them because of it. If there is still time in class, invite students to quietly study the scriptures. Invite them to look for truths that God gives us that can guide them in their lives today. Invite a few students to share what they found. Share your testimony of the principles in this lesson.\n\n\n--- Lesson 108 ---\nLike many hymns, the Psalms remind us to give thanks in all things. Expressing sincere gratitude to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ can open our eyes and hearts to Their love and mercy and allows our love for Them to grow. This lesson can help students feel Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ’s love as they express gratitude for Them. Student preparation: Invite students to offer a prayer thanking Heavenly Father without asking for anything in return. Students could prepare to share their impressions from the experience with the class. Possible Learning Activities How can I feel God’s love? Begin class by helping students ponder how they can feel God’s love. One way to do this is to invite students to imagine the following scenario. One day a friend says to you: “Sometimes in church and seminary, people talk about feeling God’s love. I’m not sure I feel it. What can I do to feel His love in my life?” How might you respond to your friend? Students might have various answers, or they might not know what to say. After students respond, you could share the following statement. President Thomas S. Monson (1927–2018) explained something we can do to feel God’s love: My brothers and sisters, do we remember to give thanks for the blessings we receive? Sincerely giving thanks not only helps us recognize our blessings, but it also unlocks the doors of heaven and helps us feel God’s love. (“ The Divine Gift of Gratitude ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2010, 87) How would you summarize what President Monson taught? As students share their answers, write the following truth on the board: Expressing gratitude for our blessings helps us feel God’s love. Read Psalm 136:1–3, 26 , looking for why the psalmist expresses gratitude for God. What do you notice? You might want to invite students to mark the phrase “for his mercy endureth for ever.” You could point out that every time the psalmist expresses gratitude, he recognizes God’s love. You might explain that in Hebrew the word for mercy in these verses is hesed , which is “a special kind of love and mercy that God feels for and extends to those who have made a covenant with Him” (Russell M. Nelson, “ The Everlasting Covenant ,” Liahona , Oct. 2022, 6). Why do you think expressing gratitude for our blessings helps us feel God’s love? Recognizing God’s blessings To help students assess how they are doing at expressing gratitude to the Lord, you could do the following activity. Remind students that the Holy Ghost can help us remember so that we can learn and improve. Invite students to listen for impressions from the Holy Ghost as they consider their answers. Think about your experiences over the last week. In your study journal, answer the following questions with the phrases never , once or twice , a few times , or many times . How often did you recognize a specific blessing from the Lord in your life? How often did you express gratitude to the Lord for your blessings? How often did you feel His love? As students consider their answers, they might think about any blessings the Lord has given them that they are not recognizing or expressing gratitude for. To help students recognize their blessings, use the handout “ Psalm 136: Gratitude to the Lord .” Students could work on the handout alone, or you could have students fill out the first box of the handout, then pass it to another classmate to complete the next box. Students continue passing until each box is filled out. The handout could then be returned to the original student to see what their classmates wrote. Allow students enough time to give thoughtful answers to each section. Open PDF After the activity, you might discuss what students learned or felt about expressing gratitude to God. As part of the discussion, you might want to emphasize how feeling and expressing gratitude can help us feel love for and from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. After students have had sufficient time to discuss, you could share the following video, available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org : “ Principles of Peace: Gratitude ” (2:32) 2:33 Expressing gratitude to God To help students practice expressing gratitude to God, you could invite them to do one of the following activities. Choose one of the following options to express your gratitude for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Pay attention to the love you might feel from Them as you do this. Express your gratitude for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in a social media post or by writing in your journal. Make a list of things that you are grateful for. Remember to include those things in your next prayer. To conclude, you might share how expressing gratitude to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ helps us feel Their love and allows our love for Them to grow.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 109 ---\nHow has wise counsel from trusted loved ones blessed your life? Studying the book of Proverbs can be like seeking wisdom from a caring friend, family member, and the Lord. Applying His wisdom in our lives can keep us on the strait and narrow covenant path. This lesson can help students identify truths that can help them follow the Lord’s path. Student preparation: Invite students to select a piece of valuable advice or helpful words of counsel they have received from parents, leaders, and trusted friends. Invite students to prepare to share the advice and how it has blessed their lives. Possible Learning Activities Trusted advice Consider beginning class by providing small pieces of paper for students. Ask them to write down a valuable piece of advice or counsel they have been given. After collecting the papers, you could read a few of the responses. Invite the student who wrote the response to share how that advice has helped them. Students could pass the remaining papers around the room, the reading the advice of other classmates. Then invite students to discuss the following questions. What makes someone’s advice meaningful to you? How do you determine whose advice you can trust? After students have shared their responses, you might invite them to prayerfully ponder the next questions. How frequently do you follow the wise counsel of others? How frequently do you seek and follow the counsel of the Lord? The wisdom of Proverbs The book of Proverbs is a collection of poetic wisdom written to the Israelites. Some passages in Proverbs are attributed to King Solomon (see Proverbs 1:1 ; 10:1 ; 25:1 ; see also 1 Kings 4:32 ), while other authors are unknown. As you study Proverbs, pay attention to how the Holy Ghost testifies of truth as you identify direction the Lord would like you to apply to your life. You could remind students that Proverbs (like Job and Ecclesiastes) uses elements of Hebrew poetry that can be challenging to readers. If needed, share that although many Proverbs are deeply spiritual, some are simply worldly advice. Read Proverbs 1:1–7 , looking for some of the purposes of the proverbs. Invite students to share what they found. If useful, you could ask why wisdom is important to learn today. Consider explaining that “the fear of the Lord” ( verse 7 ) refers to feeling and showing reverence and respect toward Him. Students might want to write this explanation in their scriptures. Why do you think reverencing or respecting the Lord might be “the beginning of knowledge”? ( verse 7 ). Read Proverbs 2:6–9 , looking for the source of true wisdom. ( Note: a buckler is a portable shield.) Consider linking or cross-referencing these verses with Mosiah 4:9 . How would you summarize what you learned as a statement of truth? Help students identify a truth such as the Lord gives us wisdom to help us follow His path . You could invite students to write this truth in their notes, scriptures, or study journals while you write it on the board. Students could share examples of times when the Lord’s wisdom helped them. They could discuss how His wisdom might be different from the wisdom of the world. Students might mention things like paying tithing leads to the Lord’s blessings ( Malachi 3:10 ) or following the Savior’s law of health brings us physical and spiritual blessings ( Doctrine and Covenants 89:18–21 ). How has following the Lord’s wise counsel helped you stay on His path? What are some examples of when the Savior sought wisdom from His Father rather than from other sources? If students need additional help thinking of moments when the Savior followed His Father’s wisdom, you could share examples like Matthew 14:23 ; 26:36–39 . Students can have an edifying learning experience as they think about how Jesus Christ was an example of the truths they identify. (For additional training on helping students see that the Savior is an example of a principle , see “ Emphasize the Example of Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills.) The Lord’s wisdom can help us follow His example Help students identify truths that invite them to follow the Savior and be more like Him. To do so, you could provide some or all of the following references from Proverbs. You might write the references you select on strips of paper. You could give one paper to each student. Invite them to read the reference and do the two steps below. Then students could pass their papers to another student and repeat the two steps. Repeat the rotation until students have studied several passages. Note: Lesson 110: “ Proverbs 3 ” will focus on the truths found in that chapter. Study one or more of the following passages from Proverbs, and do the following: Write what you learn as a statement of truth. Write a brief description of how this wisdom could help someone follow the example of Jesus Christ or become more like Him. Proverbs 1:8 Proverbs 4:14–15 Proverbs 4:26 Proverbs 6:23 Proverbs 11:17 Proverbs 15:1 Proverbs 16:16 Proverbs 16:18–19 Proverbs 17:22 Proverbs 23:17 Proverbs 28:13 Proverbs 29:18 Proverbs 30:5 The following activity can help students explain what they learned from their study of Proverbs. Students could do this activity individually, or you could organize them into groups. You could provide paper and art supplies to create a poster, or students could create something on their phones. To assist students, display the following instructions. Open PDF Imagine you were asked to create a visual that uses one of the Proverb passages to help teenagers become more like the Savior. Select a Proverb and create a poster like one you might find in the For the Strength of Youth magazine. Your visual could contain the following: A simple illustration—something creative and that could grab a teenager’s attention The Proverbs reference and the truth it teaches An explanation of how the verse from Proverbs could help a teenager follow the Savior’s example or become more like Him Share the wisdom of Proverbs Provide students an opportunity to share or display their visual. If students did this activity as groups, they could select someone to present their visual to the class. You could display the posters around the room, and students could review their classmates’ work. To conclude class, you might invite students to discuss the following questions or respond in their study journals. Pause and reflect on impressions you might have had throughout the lesson today. Then answer the following questions in your study journal: How have the truths you studied today affected your desire to follow the Lord? What have you felt impressed to do to become more like the Savior?\n\n\n--- Lesson 110 ---\nSometimes it can be hard to trust in the Lord. But as we come to know Him, we realize that “He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world” ( 2 Nephi 26:24 ). We then can see the wisdom in trusting in Him instead of leaning “unto [our] own understanding” ( Proverbs 3:5 ). This lesson can help students choose to put their trust in the Lord. Student preparation: Invite students to consider marking in their scriptures the key scripture phrase for the doctrinal mastery passage Proverbs 3:5–6 : “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart … and he shall direct thy paths.” To prepare for class, students could practice reciting the phrase several times and ponder situations in their lives in which they will need to trust in the Lord. Possible Learning Activities Trust Consider beginning class by writing the word Trust on the board. Then ask the following question while displaying the accompanying situations one at a time. Consider adapting the situations to the needs of your students. Whom would you be willing to trust … to give you a ride home late at night? with your family’s money? to give you advice on whom you should date or marry? to teach you about Jesus Christ and how to follow Him? Consider listing students’ responses to the following question on the board under the word Trust . What qualities would someone need for you to trust them? Read Proverbs 3:5 , pondering what it means to you. Then answer the following questions in your study journal: Who do you trust more: the Lord or yourself? Why? What is a situation in your life right now where you feel you need to trust the Lord more than yourself? As you study the scriptures today, look for what you learn from the Holy Ghost that helps you put your trust in the Lord. “Trust in the Lord … and lean not” Proverbs 3:5–6 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Proverbs 3:5–6 , looking for how you would complete the following statement: “If we …, then the Lord will …” Invite students to share their completed statements. Seek to validate what they share. One of the truths they might share is if we trust in the Lord with all our heart, then He will direct our paths . What do you think it means to trust in the Lord “with all [our] heart” ( verse 5 )? What do you think it means to trust in the Lord over our “own understanding” ( verse 5 )? To help students better understand this passage, invite two students to stand about three feet away from something sturdy, such as a wall. Invite one student to lean toward the wall and use it for support. Invite the other student to lean away from the wall as far as they can before losing their balance. How can these examples help us better understand Proverbs 3:5–6 ? Consider organizing students into small groups. Invite students to list on a piece of paper situations where Latter-day Saint teenagers might feel tempted to use their own judgment instead of trusting the Lord’s counsel. Examples could include choosing entertainment, deciding whom or when to date, using certain language, or making educational or future goals. After enough time, you could display the following questions. Students could use their lists to discuss the questions in their groups. What might make it hard for someone to trust the Lord over leaning to their own understanding? What advice would you give someone to help them overcome these obstacles? “He shall direct thy paths” To help students increase their desire to trust in the Lord, they could study some or all of the passages below. Students could stay in their groups, and each student could read a different passage. Read the following scripture passages, looking for why we would want to trust in the Lord instead of our own understanding: Isaiah 55:8–9 2 Nephi 4:34–35 2 Nephi 26:24 Jacob 4:10 Mosiah 4:9 When students have finished reading their passages, invite them to share what they found with their group. A few students could then share with the class. If you listed trustworthy qualities on the board at the beginning of the lesson, consider asking students how the Lord demonstrates any of these qualities. Students could add to the board any further qualities of the Lord that they think of or that they found in the passages above. Which of the Lord’s qualities help you trust Him—even when His counsel might go against your own understanding? To prepare students to answer the question below, consider showing the video “ Trust in the Lord ” (3:30), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . In this video, young people share why they choose to trust in the Lord. Consider sharing your answer to the question below in addition to what students share. 3:30 When have you or someone you know trusted in the Lord instead of your own understanding? How did He help or guide you? Putting my trust in the Lord To help students apply what they learned, consider inviting them to individually do the following. Reflect on what you wrote in your study journal at the beginning of the lesson. Seek guidance from the Lord to respond to the following questions in your journal: What did you learn today about the Lord that encourages you to trust Him? What is one way you can trust the Lord with the situation that you wrote about? How can you do this “with all [your] heart” ( Proverbs 3:5 )? It might be helpful to share your feelings about the Lord and the ways He has guided you as you have trusted in Him. Consider testifying of His ability and willingness to bless your students as they trust Him. Memorize You might want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Proverbs 3:5–6 is “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; … and he shall direct thy paths.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 111 ---\nSometimes it can be easy to focus on what happens in this life while forgetting to view our lives from an eternal perspective. In Ecclesiastes, the Preacher reminds us that the things of this world are temporary. He counsels us to prepare for when God will judge all of His children. This lesson can help students understand how focusing on meeting God at the Final Judgment can help them make wise choices. Student preparation: Invite students to have a conversation with a parent or trusted leader about how they have seen the long-term impact of the decisions they made as a teenager. Possible Learning Activities Making decisions Consider beginning class by helping students realize how an eternal perspective can influence decisions they make. To do this, you could write the following on the board. Invite students to discuss how each of these decisions when they are young can affect their future. How I treat my body How I spend my free time How I treat people Then share the following statement and invite students to make connections between the decisions above and what President Nelson taught. President Russell M. Nelson taught the following about our choices. Every righteous choice that you make here will pay huge dividends now. But righteous choices in mortality will pay unimaginable dividends eternally. … The adversary, of course, does not want you even to think about tomorrow, let alone eternal life. (“ Choices for Eternity ” [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 15, 2022], Gospel Library) How might failing to view our choices with an eternal perspective affect us? Write down a decision you are currently facing that could “pay unimaginable dividends eternally.” It could help to give students some ideas about the kinds of decisions they might write down, such as: Whether to continue spending time with a certain group of friends. Whether to repent of a sin that has been on their mind. What they choose to do on the Sabbath. Ponder why Heavenly Father might want you to think about the future as you make this decision. What might happen if you don’t? As you study Ecclesiastes today, seek to understand truths and receive personal revelation from the Lord that can help you with this decision. Focusing on temporal things In the book of Ecclesiastes, the author referred to himself as “the Preacher” ( Ecclesiastes 1:1 ). The Preacher contrasted the emptiness of focusing our lives on temporal things with the importance of preparing to meet God. Consider creating small groups and inviting each group to read one of the passages below. To help students better understand the passages, you could display the following definitions. Invite students to substitute the following words and phrases with their definitions as they read: “Vanity” means empty or fleeting. “Under heaven” or “under the sun” means in this mortal life. “Vexation of spirit” means frustrating. Read the following passages, looking for what the Preacher discovered after pursuing certain things that some people think will make them happy and bring fulfillment: Wisdom of the world. Ecclesiastes 1:13–18 Temporal pleasures and material possessions. Ecclesiastes 2:1, 4–11 You might want to clarify that worldly wisdom and material possessions are not necessarily bad or wrong. But when these things become our focus, especially over pleasing God, they become spiritually dangerous. Invite groups to discuss the following question. Then a group member could share the group’s insights with the class. In what ways might pursuing these things eventually leave us feeling empty or frustrated? Our eventual meeting with God After seeking temporal knowledge and possessions, the Preacher ends his book with the lessons he learned. Read Ecclesiastes 12:7, 13–14 , looking for what he taught that can help us keep an eternal perspective. This perspective is so important that God has inspired many of His servants to teach it. Cross-reference or link Ecclesiastes 12:7, 13–14 with Alma 34:32 and Mormon 3:20, 22 . Read these passages, looking for how Amulek and Mormon taught a similar message. How would you summarize what these verses teach in a statement of truth? Help students identify a truth like: Our choices in this life will determine how prepared we are to stand before God at the Final Judgment. Before students answer the next question, you could invite them to close their eyes and imagine meeting God after this life. Encourage them to consider what they know about Him and His attributes. What attributes of God uniquely qualify Him to be our Judge? You might remind students of Jesus Christ’s role in helping us prepare for the Final Judgment by sharing the following scripture and question. Read 3 Nephi 27:16, 19 , looking for how we can prepare to meet Jesus Christ at the Final Judgment. Why is it important to understand that we cannot prepare for the Final Judgment without Jesus Christ? Our celestial goal Help students see how knowing that our choices prepare us for eternity can affect the daily decisions we make. One way to do this is by letting students practice what President Nelson taught in the following statement. President Russell M. Nelson testified of the importance of beginning “with the end in mind”: 19:15 In my first message as President of the Church, I encouraged you to begin with the end in mind. This means making the celestial kingdom your eternal goal and then carefully considering where each of your decisions while here on earth will place you in the next world. (“ Think Celestial! ,” Liahona , Nov. 2023, 118) In what ways do Jesus Christ’s teachings and example show that He made decisions “with the end in mind”? Explain that students will practice applying what President Nelson is teaching. Before they begin, you could ask them to think of decisions that will impact them in the next life. Add these decisions to the list of decisions on the board from the beginning of class. Students could then discuss the following in small groups. Pick one of the decisions on the board and answer the following questions: What decisions might a teenager make about this that will affect their preparation to meet God? What have you learned from the gospel of Jesus Christ that could help a teenager make decisions about this? Invite groups to share their insights with the class. You might encourage students to find and share scriptures or statements from Church leaders that support what they share. The conclusion Before students complete the following activity, you might remind them about the decision they wrote down at the beginning of class. Imagine standing before God at the Final Judgment and hearing Him tell you, “Well done, good and faithful servant” ( Matthew 25:23 ). Now imagine that, while standing before God, you have the opportunity to send a message back in time to your current self. Write a message giving your current self advice that will help you prepare for the Final Judgment. You could include what you learned and felt today about: How choices when you are young affect your preparation to meet God. What adjustments you would encourage yourself to make about decisions you are currently facing. Consider testifying of the importance of making decisions with a focus on the day we will stand before God to be judged.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 113 ---\nThe prophet Isaiah had the very important responsibility to teach about redemption through Jesus Christ. This message was intended for the people in Isaiah’s time, as well as for us in our time. It is worth the effort to diligently study Isaiah’s teachings about Jesus Christ. This lesson can help students feel motivated to learn about Jesus Christ through studying Isaiah. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to come to class prepared to share a significant fact about Isaiah. They could look up Isaiah in the Bible Dictionary or Guide to the Scriptures. Possible Learning Activities A book recommendation Consider beginning class by displaying the following statements and inviting students to put them in order from most likely to least likely to persuade them to read a certain book. Looks very interesting Recommended by a family member or friend Assigned for a class at school Has great online reviews You might invite a few students to share what their top reason was and why. Read 3 Nephi 23:1–3 , looking for what book the Savior invited us to study. What thoughts do you have about the Savior’s commandment to search the words of Isaiah diligently? How might the Savior’s commandment influence how you approach your study of Isaiah? You might ask students to demonstrate their confidence in their ability to study the words of Isaiah diligently. One way to do this is to label one wall of the classroom as “very confident” and another wall as “not very confident.” Invite students to stand in between the walls according to their confidence level. Willing students could explain their level of confidence. Share with students that the Holy Ghost can help them gain confidence that the teachings of Isaiah can help them come closer to Jesus Christ. What is helpful to know about the prophet Isaiah? To help students gain some understanding about the prophet Isaiah, consider displaying the infographic “ The Kingdoms of Israel and Judah at a Glance .” Invite students to locate Isaiah. You might ask students to find answers to the following questions in the infographic: What kingdom did Isaiah live in? (Judah) What other prophets preached around the same time as Isaiah? (Micah, Hosea, Jonah) What significant event happened about a century after Isaiah prophesied it? (Judah was taken captive by Babylon) For more information, see entries for “Isaiah” in the Bible Dictionary or Guide to the Scriptures . You could invite students to share anything else they learned about Isaiah in their student preparation. Read or summarize the following paragraph. During his life, the prophet Isaiah preached to people who had turned away from faith in Jehovah (Jesus Christ). Isaiah’s message to them is reflected in his own name which means, “The Lord is salvation.” Isaiah’s teachings also apply to other periods when people would turn away from Jesus Christ—such as the time of Christ and the present day, as we prepare for His Second Coming. Isaiah’s words can help us believe more fully in Jesus Christ Students might be interested to know that “Jesus quoted Isaiah more frequently than He quoted any other prophet. Isaiah is also quoted frequently by Peter, John, and Paul in the New Testament. The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants contain more quotes from Isaiah than from any other prophet and provide much help in interpreting Isaiah” (Guide to the Scriptures, “ Isaiah ,” Gospel Library). Read 1 Nephi 19:23 , looking for why Nephi read the words of Isaiah to his brothers. What did you find? If students do not point it out, help them understand this truth: Studying the words of Isaiah can help us believe more fully in Jesus Christ. This could be a good opportunity for students to reflect on the value of coming to know Jesus Christ better through Isaiah’s words. One way you could do this is to invite students to complete the following sentence in their journals: “Believing more deeply in Jesus Christ could impact my life by …” Once students have had a chance to write, you might invite volunteers to share what they wrote with the class. Remember to express appreciation for each student who shares. Alternatively, rather than having them write in journals, you could invite students to turn to a partner and share their thoughts. Names and titles of Jesus Christ Help students understand that one of the ways Isaiah leads us to believe more fully in Jesus Christ is by teaching about His titles and roles. One way to study these titles and roles is to use a diagram. You could draw the following diagram on the board. Or, organize students into small groups and invite them to draw it on a piece of paper. Write “Jesus Christ” in the center circle. Students could then be invited to write the titles and roles of Jesus Christ that they discover in the other circles. Read the following verses and identify and consider marking the titles or roles of Jesus Christ. Isaiah 7:14 Isaiah 9:6–7 Isaiah 33:22 Isaiah 40:28 After students have read, you could display several pictures of Jesus Christ selected from the Church media library. Students could then share what titles or roles they see being fulfilled in the image. Consider inviting group members to select a title or role and learn more about it by using footnotes or looking up “Jesus Christ” in the Guide to the Scriptures or Topical Guide . You could invite students to add to the diagram by creating circles branching out from the title or role they focused on. They could list insights they learned about that title or role. (Note: this activity will be referred to in Lesson 133: “Assess Your Learning 8 .”) You might invite them to share what they learn about the Savior with their group. Why do you need the Savior to fulfill one or more of these roles in your life? How have you seen the Savior fulfill one of these roles in your life or the life of someone you know?\n\n\n--- Lesson 114 ---\nEven though we all sin and need forgiveness, sometimes we may believe we cannot be forgiven. Our Savior’s message is clear: “though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow” ( Isaiah 1:18 ). This lesson can help students feel confident that the Savior can cleanse them from their sins. Student preparation: Invite students to read the doctrinal mastery passage Isaiah 1:18 and look for the imagery that Isaiah used. Encourage students to ponder and prepare to share what the passage means to them. Students could also practice memorizing the key scripture phrase: “though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow” ( Isaiah 1:18 ). Possible Learning Activities The stain of sin Consider beginning class by displaying the following image or an article of stained clothing. Think about times when you had a stain on your clothing that would not come out. How might our sins be compared to stains? What are some reasons people might think they cannot be cleansed of their sins? You might want to display the following prompt, so students can reflect on their feelings. Reflect on which of the following statements you relate with most. You might ask yourself why you feel that way. I am confident the Savior can cleanse me of all my sins. I believe the Savior can cleanse me of some of my sins, but not all of them. I believe the Savior can cleanse other people’s sins, but not mine. I do not believe the Savior can cleanse sins. One of the many roles of the Holy Ghost is to testify of Jesus Christ (see 3 Nephi 28:11 ). As you study Isaiah 1 , pay attention to what Heavenly Father would have you learn through the Holy Ghost about Jesus Christ and His power to cleanse sins. A sinful nation Read Isaiah 1:2–4 , looking for the spiritual condition of the Israelites. Invite students to report what they find. The following can help students learn important skills for studying Isaiah. As you study Isaiah’s teachings, it is helpful to understand that he often recorded the Lord’s words in a poetic form called parallelism . Parallelism occurs when a writer expresses an idea and then repeats or contrasts the idea using different words. For example, find the related phrases in verse 2 . You could help students identify the combined phrases “Hear, O heavens” and “give ear, O earth” ( Isaiah 1:2 ). This is an example of parallelism. Isaiah also used imagery to illustrate his teachings. For example, read verse 3 , looking for the different images Isaiah used to teach the Israelites. You could ask students what Isaiah taught the Israelites by using the images of an ox and donkey. If needed, explain that unlike an ox and donkey, the Israelites did not recognize their Master. Consider summarizing verses 5–15 by sharing the following paragraph. The Lord warned the Israelites that their sins were having negative effects on them (see Isaiah 1:5–9 ). He also explained that He was not pleased with their religious acts of worship because they were being offered without sincerity (see Isaiah 1:10–15 ). From scarlet to white Read Isaiah 1:16–17 , looking for the Lord’s invitations to the people. What did the Lord invite them to do? Read Isaiah 1:18 , looking for the Lord’s promise as we repent. Please note that Isaiah used both parallelism and imagery to illustrate this promise. Isaiah 1:18 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. To help students better understand the imagery used in verse 18 , consider displaying the following images. Open PDF Open PDF What can the images of scarlet and crimson teach us about sin? Sister Sharon Eubank, formerly of the Relief Society General Presidency, explained: 11:29 The scarlet dye of the Old Testament was not only colorful but also colorfast, meaning that its vivid color stuck to the wool and would not fade no matter how many times it was washed. Satan wields this reasoning like a club: white wool stained scarlet can never go back to being white. But Jesus Christ declares, “My ways [are] higher than your ways,” and the miracle of His grace is that when we repent of our sins, His scarlet blood returns us to purity. It isn’t logical, but it is nevertheless true. (“ Christ: The Light That Shines in Darkness ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 75) What can the images of snow and wool teach us about the Savior’s promise as we repent? How might you summarize verses 16–18 into a statement of truth? Though students may use different words, help them identify the following truth: If we sincerely repent, Jesus Christ will cleanse us from our sins. What the Savior experienced so we can repent The following scriptures can help students reflect on what the Savior experienced so they can be cleansed from their sins. Consider organizing students into pairs. Each pair could read the following scriptures and discuss what they learned with each other. The accompanying questions could help. Willing students could then share with the class. Read Alma 7:13–14 and Doctrine and Covenants 19:16–19 , looking for what the Savior experienced so you can repent and be cleansed from your sins. What did you find? What did you learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from these verses that could help someone choose to repent? To help students feel that they can be cleansed by the Savior, consider showing a video, such as “ There Is No Limit to God’s Love ” (from time codes 0:00 to 4:54). This video is available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Students could ponder how the girl in the video felt because of her sins and evidence of the truth taught in Isaiah 1:18 . You could then invite students to share what they found. 5:37 One way to invite the Holy Ghost is to give students opportunities to share feelings, testimonies, and experiences. The following question is one way students can do this. Consider inviting students to respond to the question first in their journal, and then willing students can share what they wrote with the class. As students share, remind them not to share names or anything too personal. What have you felt about Jesus Christ and His ability to cleanse you from sin? Consider concluding with your feelings about the Savior and His power to cleanse us when we repent. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Isaiah 1:18 is “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 115 ---\nThrough the prophet Isaiah, the Lord warned Israel against their sinful choices, including calling “evil good, and good evil” ( Isaiah 5:20 ). Today, there are many destructive ideas and practices that appear to be good. This lesson can increase students’ ability to discern between good and evil. Student preparation: Invite students to come to class prepared to share an example of something that was assumed to be harmless, or even good, that eventually was shown to be harmful. Possible Learning Activities Spiritually dangerous ideas and actions Consider beginning class by displaying a picture of a camouflaged cheetah, like the one at the start of this lesson. Then, you could ask the following question and display the statement by Elder David A. Bednar. What makes a cheetah dangerous to its prey? Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles compared cheetahs to dangerous ideas and actions. 15:59 To me, cheetahs are sleek, alluring, and captivating creatures. A cheetah’s yellowish-tan to greyish-white coat with black spots acts as a beautiful disguise that makes these animals almost invisible as they stalk their prey in the African grasslands. In a similar way, spiritually dangerous ideas and actions frequently can appear to be attractive, desirable, or pleasurable. Thus, in our contemporary world, each of us needs to be aware of beguiling bad that pretends to be good. (“ Watchful unto Prayer Continually ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 33) What are some examples of “spiritually dangerous ideas and actions” that “can appear to be attractive, desirable, or pleasurable”? It will be helpful to write students’ responses on the board. Students might say things such as, “It’s my body. I can do what I want with it” or “It’s fine as long as you don’t get caught.” You will refer to these ideas on the board later in the lesson. Why is it important for you to recognize beguiling bad pretending to be good? The following explanation and invitation can help students begin to see how what they will study in this lesson is important in their lives. It can be hard to recognize these deceptive ideas and actions, particularly when we may be influenced by them. Each of us thinks or acts in ways that are not fully aligned with the teachings of Jesus Christ (see Romans 3:23 ). Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will help us recognize this in ourselves as we seek Their help through the Holy Ghost. As you study today, pay close attention to how the Holy Ghost may be helping you discern truth from error. Camouflaged deceptions Summarize the following paragraph to introduce students to the overall message of Isaiah 5 . In Isaiah 5 , the Lord taught the Israelites about His love for them and the consequences of their sinful choices through the analogy of a vineyard. Even though the Lord tried to help them grow, the Israelites’ sinful choices led them to become “wild grapes” (see Isaiah 5:2 ), a symbol for their corruption and bitter character. Because they chose to “cast away” and despise the Lord and His teachings (see Isaiah 5:24 ), they would be left without the Lord’s help. You could invite students to glance through Isaiah 5:8–23 and count the number of times the Lord used the word “woe” (six times). Explain that “woe” means intense sorrow or suffering. The Lord tried to teach the Israelites that their sinful choices were turning them away from Him and leading to sorrow and suffering. While there are many truths this lesson could focus on, the rest of this lesson will focus on the doctrinal mastery passage Isaiah 5:20 . Isaiah 5:20 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to consider marking doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way, so they can locate them easily. Read Isaiah 5:20 , looking for what brings woe, or sadness and suffering. What did you find? Help students identify a truth, such as If we call evil good and good evil, we will eventually experience sorrow and suffering. You might invite students to consider marking the three pairs in the verse, evil and good , darkness and light , and bitter and sweet . Explain that Isaiah often provided multiple examples to help bring greater clarity to his teachings. How is it that calling evil good and good evil eventually leads to sorrow and suffering? Acknowledging the difficulty in identifying these deceptions can help students feel understood, recognize obstacles, and see their need for God. Refer to the list of “spiritually dangerous ideas and actions” on the board, and ask the following question. What can make it difficult to identify these spiritually dangerous ideas and actions? Think if there are any spiritually dangerous ideas or actions you might see as attractive, desirable, or pleasurable. Jesus Christ is the truth After identifying difficulties, help students see Jesus Christ as the solution. Read John 14:6 , looking for what Jesus said about who He is. What do you think Jesus means when He says that He is the truth? What have Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ given to help us recognize the deceptive ideas and actions we listed earlier? Although this is not a comprehensive list, students might share some things like the following: The Spirit (see Doctrine and Covenants 11:12–13 ) The Light of Christ (see Moroni 7:16–19 ) Prophets (see Doctrine and Covenants 21:1, 4–6 ) Scriptures (see 2 Timothy 3:15–17 ) If you perceive a need in your students, you might read and discuss some of the scriptures provided. The next activity gives students an opportunity to study the Savior’s teachings to help them recognize His truth. Refer students to the list of spiritually dangerous ideas and actions on the board. Display the following instructions. To help us discern truth from error, we can turn to the teachings of Jesus Christ and His prophets. One place we can “find the teachings of Jesus Christ and His prophets” is in For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices (“ Make Inspired Choices ,” For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices [2022]). Pick one idea or action that is evil pretending to be good or good being portrayed as or labeled evil. Study the For the Strength of Youth guide, looking for the teachings of Jesus Christ and His prophets that can help you choose to follow Jesus Christ instead of the devil’s deceptive messages. Write how the Savior’s teachings correct the false ideas. Invite students to share what they have found. To do so, a student could choose an idea or action from the board. Ask the class to explain how something they learned shows that idea or action as spiritually destructive. For example, if a student chose “It’s fine as long as you don’t get caught,” students might share something they learned in the section “ Truth will make you free ” in the For the Strength of Youth guide, such as the paragraphs that begin “ Living with integrity means that you love truth will all your heart ” or “ Love the truth .” Reflecting on learning Give students an opportunity to reflect on what they have learned by displaying a question such as the following. Write an answer to the following question in your study journal: What have you learned today that can help you recognize the truth and better follow Jesus Christ? You could invite students to share their feelings and testimony by sharing what they wrote. Consider testifying of Jesus Christ and His title as the Truth. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery passage and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Isaiah 5:20 is “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 116 ---\nGod’s children have been spiritually scattered, and He wants to gather them to the safety of His gospel. Using the imagery of a tree and an ensign, Isaiah prophesied of the gathering of Israel. This lesson can help students feel more motivated to share the gospel with others. Student preparation: Consider giving each student the two self-evaluation questions from the beginning of the lesson and inviting them to ponder how they would answer. Possible Learning Activities How do you feel about sharing the gospel? Consider preparing one of the following and, as they listen, invite students to ponder how they feel about sharing the gospel: An account from a student about when they, or someone they know, shared the gospel (You can ask if a student would be willing to share an experience at this point of the lesson, or you may set this up in advance.) One of your own experiences One of the following stories from Elder Gary E. Stevenson, “ Love, Share, Invite ,” May 2022 Brother Wisan ( pg 86 , or time code 5:40–7:06) 13:3 Mayra ( pg 86 , or time code 8:33–9:42) 13:3 Invite students to ponder how likely they are to share the gospel. It may be helpful to have them answer the following in their study journals: How do you feel about sharing the gospel? Why do you feel the way you do? If students are comfortable, they can express some of their thoughts or feelings to the class. As you study today, seek help through the Holy Ghost to increase your desire to share the gospel. Also seek help with any questions or concerns you may have. Isaiah’s prophecy Consider drawing or displaying something like the following, but do not include the labels. If you would like, invite students to make a similar drawing in their journals. In Isaiah 11 , Isaiah taught by symbolically using the parts of a tree. Read Isaiah 11:1 and label the drawing. (It may be helpful to know that the stem could also be translated stump and rod as a small branch or shoot.) What tools and skills can you use to discover who or what the stem symbolizes? Some possible answers are the chapter heading and footnotes. Help students use these to find the symbolism. For example, footnote 1c leads to the following Doctrine and Covenants verses. Read Doctrine and Covenants 113:1–2 , looking for the inspired answers to what the stem symbolizes. On the board, label the stem or trunk Jesus Christ . Students could also write this in their scriptures next to Isaiah 11:1 . If the Savior is the trunk, what might the part of the tree that was cut down symbolize? A possible answer is that the Savior built a great kingdom or tree through David (the son of Jesse), but they fell into wickedness, divided into kingdoms, and would eventually be conquered (like a tree being cut down). However, the Savior would remember His covenant and help the descendants of David to grow, promising to gather them again. Isaiah then prophesied of the Savior through the Second Coming and Millennium. Read one or two of the following sets of verses, looking for descriptions of the Savior and His influence. Isaiah 11:2–5 . Isaiah 11:6–9 . ( Note : These verses describe the Millennium and how the knowledge of the Lord will affect the world. Both asp and cockatrice refer to venomous snakes.) Isaiah 12:1–6 . Invite students to share phrases they found about the Savior or His influence that motivate them to want to come closer to the Savior, or help others gather to Him. If needed, consider explaining that Isaiah 11:6–9 illustrates the peace the Savior will bring to the world. A prophecy of Joseph Smith Show a picture of Moroni appearing before the young Joseph Smith and explain the following: Moroni quoted Isaiah 11 to Joseph Smith several times (see Joseph Smith—History 1:40, 45–46, 49 ). Isaiah prophesied not only of the Savior in the last days but also of Joseph Smith. You may want to write Joseph Smith next to “rod” in Isaiah 11:1 and “root” in Isaiah 11:10 . (See also Doctrine and Covenants 113:3–6 .) Read Isaiah 11:10–12 , looking for the work the Lord would do through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Listen carefully as students share what they found. If useful, explain the following: The phrase “set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people” ( Isaiah 11:11 ) refers to the latter-day gathering of Israel (see Doctrine and Covenants 137:6 ). An ensign is a flag or banner that an army may gather under or march behind. “ Ensign for the nations” ( Isaiah 11:12 ) refers to the Restoration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, including all its ordinances and covenants (see Doctrine and Covenants 45:9 ). Write the following phrase on the board: The Lord’s restored Church is an ensign to gather people to the gospel of Jesus Christ. An ensign for the nations To help students better understand this principle, pass out the handout “ An Ensign for the Nations .” Display the following instructions and invite students to fill them in on the handout individually or in small groups. Open PDF Question 1: Why would others want to gather to the Savior and His Church? On the flag, write several things you know about Jesus Christ and His restored Church that you think would attract others to gather to Him and join His Church. You might include things that are unique to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (such as the Book of Mormon, modern-day prophets, the priesthood of God, and latter-day temples). Write about how the Lord blesses us through these things. Question 2: Why gather with others to the Lord? Next to the figures gathered around the flag, write some of the blessings we can receive as we gather with others to the Lord. You may think about the advantages of an army gathering together and how it may apply to us, how the various people in your ward or branch strengthen each other, or how Moses 7:18 illustrates some advantages. Question 3: How can we invite others to come to the Savior? Below the figures gathered around the flag, write several ways we can share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others. You might include ways you have tried. After completing the handout, invite students to share what they wrote on the handout and how they feel about what they wrote. If they do not do it naturally, invite them to share how what they learned today could help them feel more motivated to share the gospel.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 117 ---\nHow do you respond when it seems as though your earnest prayers go unanswered? Throughout scripture, the Lord and His prophets have emphasized our need to be waiting for the Lord (see Isaiah 25:9 ), patiently seeking blessings and answers. This lesson can help students understand the importance of waiting for the Lord. Student preparation: Invite students to reflect on a time when they or someone they know had to patiently wait for an answer or blessing from Heavenly Father. They could prepare to share what makes the experience of waiting easy or difficult for them. Possible Learning Activities Developing patience by practice To help students understand how difficult it can be to wait patiently for something, consider displaying a marshmallow or a picture of a child looking at a marshmallow as the following paragraph is read or summarized. Alternatively, you could use the video “ Continue in Patience ,” from ChurchofJesusChrist.org , time code 0:00–1:08, to get students thinking about our need to wait patiently. In the video, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, introduces the same marshmallow experiment. 2:42 To test children’s ability to patiently wait, researchers placed a large marshmallow in front of several four-year-olds. The children were told that they could eat the marshmallow immediately. However, if they were able to wait 15 minutes, they would be given two marshmallows. Only 30 percent of the children were able to wait. What do you think might have made the difference between the children who could wait and those who could not? When have you had difficulty waiting for something? What made it challenging for you? At times, Heavenly Father may ask us to wait for a desired answer or blessing. Sometimes, He might not provide the desired answer or blessing in the way or at the time we want. What are some examples of blessings or answers from the Lord we may need to patiently wait for? Students may mention waiting for confirmation that the Book of Mormon is true, seeking healing blessings for a sick loved one, or petitioning Heavenly Father for answers to their gospel questions. To help students identify how this lesson applies to their individual needs, provide an opportunity for them to ponder the following self-assessment questions. What blessings or answers from Heavenly Father are you currently waiting to receive? What might He ask you to wait for in the future? What makes waiting for something from Heavenly Father easy or difficult for you? As you study today, seek the help of the Holy Ghost to increase your understanding of the importance of waiting on the will and timing of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. You could prayerfully invite Heavenly Father to strengthen your ability to wait patiently. Patiently waiting for the Lord It might be helpful to share with students that the Lord sent the prophet Isaiah to the nation of Judah during a chaotic time of political and social uncertainty. Isaiah 25 reminds the house of Israel of the great blessings they have and will receive from the Lord. Read Isaiah 25:1–4, 6–9 , looking for what the Lord had already done for Israel and what He would do for them in the future. What blessings stand out to you? According to verse 9 , what does the Lord ask us to do to receive His blessings? Help students identify a truth such as if we wait for the Lord, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation . You could write the phrase “wait for the Lord” on the board. Invite students to imagine a friend asked them to explain what this phrase means. Help students create an explanation for this phrase. If students need additional help understanding what it means to wait for the Lord, you could share the following statement. Elder Robert D. Hales (1932–2017) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught: In the scriptures, the word wait means to hope, to anticipate, and to trust. To hope and trust in the Lord requires faith, patience, humility, meekness, long-suffering, keeping the commandments, and enduring to the end. (“ Waiting Upon the Lord: Thy Will Be Done ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2011, 71) Is there anything you would add to help someone understand what it means to wait for the Lord? Why do you think it is important to the Lord that we learn to wait for Him? How does that help us become more like Him? Students could benefit from seeing the example of Jesus Christ waiting for Heavenly Father. You could share other examples from Elder Hales’s message, “ Waiting Upon the Lord: Thy Will Be Done ,” (time code 0:59–2:57). 16:12 Great blessings promised to those who wait on the Lord To help students see other blessings the Lord has promised to those who wait for Him, you could use the following scripture study skill activity. This activity helps students practice linking or cross-referencing verses to help increase their understanding of the principle. Select one or more of the following verses to study: Psalm 27:14 ; Isaiah 40:31 ; Doctrine and Covenants 133:45 . Look for additional blessings the Lord promises to those who wait for Him. What might the blessings of waiting for the Lord look like today? Students might share blessings like peace, joy, or strength while they are waiting for the Lord. As an example of blessings that came after waiting on the Lord, you could show President Uchtdorf’s story in the video “ Continue in Patience ,” from ChurchofJesusChrist.org , time code 1:07–2:41. Invite students to look for what President Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, did to act in faith as he waited for the promised blessings of following the Word of Wisdom. 2:42 After you display the following questions, you might share a brief experience you have had while students think about how they would respond. When have you had an experience of waiting for an answer or blessing? What have you done that has helped you wait for the Lord? We are to actively wait for the Lord Providing an opportunity for students to share what they have studied can make it easier for them to recognize their learning and growth. One way to do this would be with the activity below. If useful, invite students to think of additional details to add to the scenario to make it relevant to them. Imagine you were asked to give advice to someone struggling while waiting for a blessing or an answer to their prayers. In your study journal: List something you have learned today that has helped you understand the importance of waiting on the Lord. You might share something you know about the Lord that has helped you. Write down a passage from Isaiah 25 or another scripture that could be helpful for someone actively waiting on the Lord. Write down something you feel would be helpful for someone to do while they are waiting for the Lord’s answers and blessings. You could include an experience when you or someone you know has experienced the Lord’s blessings. Consider concluding class by sharing how you have come to know that you can trust the Lord as you wait for Him.\n\n\n--- Lesson 118 ---\nHow is the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Book of Mormon marvelous to you? Isaiah described the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, including the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, as “a marvellous work and a wonder” ( Isaiah 29:14 ). This lesson can help students feel gratitude for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Book of Mormon. Student preparation: Invite students to think of how they might define the words marvelous and wonderful. Using their definition, invite them to find a verse or story in the Book of Mormon that is marvelous or wonderful to them. Possible Learning Activities Apostasy To see the need for the Restoration of the gospel, it is helpful for students to understand the Great Apostasy. To do this, tell students they are going to try and guess an event based on clues. Then display the following phrases one at a time as students try to guess “the Great Apostasy.” As students identify it, invite them to raise their hand but not share the answer yet. Use the following phrases to determine what event is being described: “darkness shall cover the earth” ( Isaiah 60:2 ) “a famine of hearing the words of the Lord” ( Amos 8:11 ) “grievous wolves shall enter in among you” ( Acts 20:29 ) “a falling away” ( 2 Thessalonians 2:3 ) Invite students to share what they understand about the Great Apostasy. If needed, you could share that the Great Apostasy refers to “a widespread falling away from the gospel and Church of Jesus Christ” that occurred after the death of the Savior and His Apostles ( Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ , 37). Alternatively, you could watch “ What Is the Restoration? ,” available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 0:32 to 2:09. 5:13 It may be helpful to explain to students that many of Isaiah’s prophecies referred to different time periods and had multiple fulfilments. For example, Isaiah 29 was a prophecy for Isaiah’s own people that Jerusalem would soon be destroyed. However, his prophecy in Isaiah 29 can also refer to the Great Apostasy (see 2 Nephi 27 ). Read Isaiah 29:8–10 , looking for descriptions of the Great Apostasy. How does the passage describe people who have either abandoned or never had access to the Lord’s truth due to the Great Apostasy? We live in a world where many are still spiritually hungry, staggering, or sleeping. We may also make choices that distance us from the Lord. Take a moment to ponder ways you, or those you love, may feel this way. As you study today, seek help from the Holy Ghost to appreciate what Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have given us to overcome these challenges and turn to Them. A marvelous work and a wonder Read Isaiah 29:4 to identify what Isaiah prophesied the Lord would bless us with to overcome the effects of the Great Apostasy. To help students understand that verse 4 is referring to the Book of Mormon, you could provide students with some of the following scripture references: 2 Nephi 33:13 Mormon 8:23 Last paragraph of “ Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith ” found in the introductory pages of the Book of Mormon. Alternatively, you could display all of the references on the board and invite students to use as many of them as they need to identify what the Lord has blessed us with. Students could pick one or more of these references and cross-reference, or link, them to Isaiah 29:4 . This can help them remember what they are learning. You might invite students to read Isaiah 29:11–12 and looking for other phrases that could refer to the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Students might mark, “the book is delivered to him that is not learned” ( Isaiah 29:12 ). This phrase refers to Joseph Smith, who received very little formal schooling. If students do not know, you could explain that these verses refer to an event in Church history found in Joseph Smith—History 1:62–65 . Isaiah 29:13–14 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Isaiah 29:13–14 , looking for what the Lord said He would do to overcome the effects of the Apostasy. President Russell M. Nelson explained what the marvelous work and wonder is: That marvelous work [and wonder] would include the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the Restoration of the gospel. (“ Scriptural Witnesses ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2007, 46) How would you summarize what we can learn from Isaiah 29:13–14 ? Students might share something similar to the following: The Lord restored the gospel of Jesus Christ, including the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, to overcome the effects of the Great Apostasy . Explain that the Restoration of the Gospel is “God’s reestablishment of the truths and ordinances of His gospel among men on earth” (“ Restoration of the Gospel ,” Guide to the Scriptures, Gospel Library). Alternatively, you could watch “ What Is the Restoration? ” from time code 2:09 to 5:13. 5:13 To help students analyze this truth, consider placing them in groups to discuss the following questions. What can this truth teach us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? How can the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Book of Mormon help us overcome the spiritual difficulties caused by the Great Apostasy? The blessings of the marvelous work and wonder The following can help students see how the Restoration and the Book of Mormon can help us overcome the effects of the Great Apostasy. Write the question “ How can the Lord bless me through the Restoration and the Book of Mormon? ” in your journal. Read Isaiah 29:18–19 and write what you find that answers the question. Invite students to continue to add answers and thoughts to their study journal as they continue learning. To help students see how the marvelous work and wonder of the Book of Mormon can bless us, you could share President Russell M. Nelson’s teachings in the following video available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . “ The Book of Mormon: What Would Your Life Be Like without It? ” from time code 5:38 to 8:44. 15:1 The following activity can help students reflect on how the Book of Mormon or the Restoration is marvelous to them. Ensure that students have enough time to successfully complete the activity. You may want to display the instructions for the activity on the board. Complete one of the following activities: Activity 1 Identify a verse or story from the Book of Mormon that brings you closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. If helpful, you could look at Book of Mormon doctrinal mastery passages. Explain why it is marvelous to you. Activity 2 Identify a doctrine, ordinance, blessing, or other aspect of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ (modern-day prophets, temples, the priesthood, and so on) that helps you draw closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Explain why it is marvelous to you. After enough time, invite students to get into small groups and share their explanations. Consider concluding class by inviting students to ponder why they are grateful to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ for the Restoration and the Book of Mormon. Consider sharing your feelings about why you are grateful for the Restoration or the Book of Mormon. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Isaiah 29:13–14 is “The Restoration of the gospel is ‘a marvellous work and a wonder.’” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”",

God offers us, His covenant people today, the same words of comfort: “Fear thou not; for I am with thee” ( Isaiah 41:10 ). This lesson can help students feel God’s comfort. Student preparation: Invite students to read or listen to the words of some or all verses in the hymn “ How Firm a Foundation ” ( Hymns—for Home and Church ). Ask them to identify comforting words or phrases and to come to class prepared to share. Possible Learning Activities Fear is not new Consider beginning class by displaying the following statement and question. Students could be invited to list their answers on the board. Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared the following observation: Fear is not new. The disciples of Jesus Christ, out on the Sea of Galilee, feared the “wind, and the waves” in the dark of the night ( Mark 4:34 ). As His disciples today, we too have fears. (“ Be Not Troubled ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 18) What are some fears people throughout the world, including disciples of Jesus Christ, might have? After students have listed various fears, share the remainder of Elder Rasband’s statement, which includes fears he has seen in the world today. You could add some of these to the list on the board. Elder Rasband continued: 15:42 Our single adults fear making commitments such as getting married. Young marrieds … can fear bringing children into an increasingly wicked world. Missionaries fear lots of things, especially approaching strangers. Widows fear going forward alone. Teenagers fear not being accepted; grade schoolers fear the first day of school; university students fear getting back a test. We fear failure, rejection, disappointment, and the unknown. We fear hurricanes, earthquakes, and fires that ravage the land and our lives. We fear not being chosen, and on the flip side, we fear being chosen. We fear not being good enough; we fear that the Lord has no blessings for us. We fear change, and our fears can escalate to terror. Have I included just about everyone? (“ Be Not Troubled ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 18) What effect can our fears have on us? Consider inviting students to reflect on whether they can relate to any of the fears that have been listed or to think of their own fears. Share the following context to help students see circumstances that may have caused the Israelites to fear. Isaiah prophesied of the destruction and captivity that would come upon Israel and Judah. Beginning in Isaiah 40 , God inspired Isaiah to write to the Jews in the distant future who would be dwelling in captivity. What could be some fears or concerns a person in captivity might face? Read Isaiah 40:1–2 , looking for the message God instructed Isaiah to deliver to His covenant people. What attributes or characteristics of God do you learn from these verses? Share your witness that God comforts His covenant people in our day. Consider displaying the following image. Students could draw this, or something similar, in their study journals. Invite them to make marks on their drawing to answer the accompanying questions. Fear Comfort In general, where on this scale would you place your feelings about your life right now? Where would you place your feelings about the future? As you study, look for what God teaches that can help you experience more of His comfort . If you read or hear something you think might bring comfort, those thoughts could be the Holy Ghost communicating to you. Consider recording these insights near the drawing in your study journal. God comforts His people To help comfort His covenant people, God inspired Isaiah to teach many things about Him in Isaiah 40–43 . You will have the opportunity to identify some of these truths and consider how they could help comfort someone who is afraid. Display the following instructions and explain that students will have the chance to complete this activity later in the lesson. Using a passage from Isaiah, create a short message that could comfort someone who is afraid. Include each of the following: Step 1. Words or phrases from the passage that could help someone feel comforted by God. Summarize these into a simple statement of truth. Step 2. A scripture, hymn, or statement from a Church leader to support the teachings in the passage. Step 3. A personal experience or modern example that illustrates how knowing this about God can bring comfort. Model Before students complete this activity, explain that you will provide a model using Isaiah 41:10–14 . The following is one way you could model these steps. Continue to display the three steps and be very clear with students when you are demonstrating each step. Read Isaiah 41:10–14 , looking for God’s words of comfort to His covenant people. Note that worm in verse 14 can mean meek and humble . Step 1 What words or phrases do you think could be comforting? Why? How would you summarize them into a simple statement of truth? In their own words, students may have identified something such as: We don’t need to fear, because God will be with and strengthen His covenant people. Step 2 To help students understand this truth, consider singing or listening to “ How Firm a Foundation ” ( Hymns—for Home and Church ) as a class. Invite students to look for and share words or phrases they find comforting. Depending on time, you might only sing verses 3 and 7. You could also invite students to link Isaiah 41:10 to verse 3 of this hymn in Gospel Library. 3:60 How can knowing God will be with and strengthen us help us not to fear? Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared how our relationship with the Lord can help us to not fear: 15:3 Even with the increasing worldly influences around us, we need not fear. The Lord will never desert His covenant people. There is a compensatory power of spiritual gifts and divine direction for the righteous. This added blessing of spiritual power, however, does not settle upon us just because we are part of this generation. It comes as we strengthen our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and keep His commandments, as we come to know Him and love Him. (Neil L. Andersen, “ Drawing Closer to the Savior ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 73–74) Step 3 When have you felt that God was with you or had strengthened you? Messages of comfort Give students time to prepare their short message of comfort. They could do this individually or with a partner. Select one of the following sets of verses. Create a short message that could comfort someone who is afraid. Follow the three steps to do this. Isaiah 40:9–11 Isaiah 40:28–31 Isaiah 41:17–20 Isaiah 42:5–7 Isaiah 43:1–2 Isaiah 43:25–26 When students are ready, invite them to share their messages of comfort in groups or with the class. If students share a hymn as part of their message, you could invite them to select a verse that supports what they shared. Sing that verse together as a class. You could repeat this, depending on how much time you have available. Conclusion Give students time to reflect on what they have learned about God that can bring them comfort. Remind them that these insights may have been inspired by the Holy Ghost, who teaches and testifies of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Invite students to record their thoughts in their study journals.\n\n\n--- Lesson 120 ---\nEvery day, we face influences that challenge our devotion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Faced with similar temptations, some Israelites in Isaiah’s day turned to worshipping other sources. In response, the Lord lovingly but clearly warned the Israelites against worshipping false gods. This lesson can help students place Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ before anyone or anything else in their lives. Student preparation: Invite students to think about what they have learned throughout their study of the Old Testament. Then, invite them to ponder, “How has what I’ve learned about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ increased my desire to put Them first in my life?” Possible Learning Activities Hero worship Consider beginning class by asking the following question. If you were to survey teenagers in our area about who their heroes are, who do you think they might include? Then invite students to do the following in their study journals. Make a list of your personal heroes. Put a star next to the ones who seem to have the most influence in your life. Bishop W. Christopher Waddell of the Presiding Bishopric shared the following counsel about our heroes. 10:7 When I was a young boy, my first heroes were athletes. My earliest memories are of collecting baseball cards with the pictures and statistics of Major League Baseball players. “Hero worship” as a child can be fun and innocent, as when children dress up as their favorite superheroes for Halloween. Although we admire and respect many talented and remarkable men and women for their abilities and contributions, the degree to which they are revered, if taken to an excess, can be the equivalent of the children of Israel worshipping a golden calf in the desert of Sinai. … The hero—our hero, now and always—is Jesus Christ, and anything or anyone that distracts us from His teachings, as found in the scriptures and through the words of living prophets, can negatively impact our progress on the covenant path. (“ More Than a Hero ,” Liahona , Nov. 2023, 90) What stands out to you from Bishop Waddell’s message? To help students assess where they place Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in their lives, you could invite them to look back at their list of heroes as they silently ponder the following questions. Do any of the heroes on your list distract you from your worship of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Are there any interests, activities, or objects that might distract you from worshipping Them? As students prepare to study the teachings of Isaiah today, invite them to listen for impressions from the Holy Ghost about ways they can put Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ first in their lives. No other God Explain that the children of Israel in Isaiah’s day struggled to put the Lord first in their lives. Instead, they turned to false gods such as idols for help. Consider inviting partnerships or small groups to read the following verses and come up with a single-sentence summary of what they learned. Read Isaiah 44:6, 8 and 46:9 , looking for what the Lord wanted the children of Israel to understand about the focus of their worship. Invite several students to share the summary of what their group learned. If they don’t naturally share it, help students identify a truth similar to the following: No one and nothing on earth can compare to Jesus Christ. As part of your discussion, you might point out that Isaiah 44:6 contains several titles for Jesus Christ. You could invite students to share what these titles teach about Jesus Christ. In Isaiah 44–46 , the Lord describes the Israelites’ worship of false gods. He reminds the people that they created, worshipped, and prayed to idols made of the same wood they used to make fires and cook food. And when the Israelites were carried into captivity, their animals struggled to pull carts weighed down with their heavy man-made idols. Read Isaiah 44:14–19 and Isaiah 46:1–2 , looking for the Lord’s description of ancient idols that could apply to things that distract people from the Lord in our day. (It may be helpful to know that two of the idols they worshiped were called Bel and Nebo.) What did you find? You might write the phrase “Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?” ( Isaiah 44:19 ) on the board. Ask students to share what this question means in their own words. Then erase the phrase “the stock of a tree” from the question, leaving “Shall I fall down to ?” Invite students to come to the board and finish the sentence in ways that apply to people in our day. What is the danger of putting these people or things ahead of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Why can it be difficult to always put Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ first in our lives? Putting Jesus Christ first To help students put the Savior first in their lives, you could display an image of Jesus Christ, such as the one at the beginning of the lesson, in the center of the board. As students do the following activity, they could write the attributes they find around the image. Study at least two of the following passages. As you read the verses slowly and carefully, look for what we can learn about Jesus Christ that gives us confidence to put Him first in our lives. Isaiah 44:1–4 Isaiah 44:21–23 Isaiah 44:24–25 Isaiah 45:20–22 Isaiah 46:3–5 You might ask students to add any other attributes to the board that they know about Jesus Christ from their experiences or from other scriptures. To help students share their thoughts about the matchless power of Jesus Christ, you might ask the following. How might understanding these truths about Jesus Christ help someone who finds it difficult to put Him first in their lives? What experiences have you had that have helped you put Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ first in your life? Planning to put Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ first To help students make a plan to more fully put Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ first in their lives, you could use the handout titled “Making a Plan.” Encourage them to listen for impressions from the Holy Ghost as they determine what they would like to do to accomplish their goal. Open PDF\n\n\n--- Lesson 121 ---\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ know you personally and perfectly. Yet sometimes we see the challenges of mortality and cry, “The Lord has forsaken me” (see Isaiah 49:14 ). Isaiah’s words reassure us that we have been graven upon the Savior’s hands and will never be forsaken or forgotten (see Isaiah 49:16 ). This lesson can help students feel that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love us and will not forget us. Student preparation: Invite students to come to class having pondered experiences where they felt Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ had remembered them. They might ask a family member or friend about experiences feeling remembered by Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Possible Learning Activities Remembered by the Lord Consider beginning class by displaying an image of the tiny flowers called “forget-me-nots.” Sharing a childhood memory, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, said: 21:42 As a child, when I would look at the little forget-me-nots, I sometimes felt a little like that flower—small and insignificant. I wondered if I would be forgotten by my family or by my Heavenly Father. (“ Forget Me Not ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2011, 122) What are some reasons a teenager might feel forgotten by others or by Heavenly Father? What do you already know about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that you would want to share with someone who feels they are forgotten? President Uchtdorf continued: 21:42 Years later I can look back on that young boy with tenderness and compassion. And I do know now—I was never forgotten. And I know something else: as an Apostle of our Master, Jesus Christ, I proclaim with all the certainty and conviction of my heart—neither are you! You are not forgotten. (“ Forget Me Not ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2011, 122) Ponder your own experiences with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you answer the following questions: How confident do you feel that They know and remember you? What experiences have you or someone you know had that help you better understand how perfectly They know and remember you? As you study Isaiah 49 today, seek impressions from the Holy Ghost testifying that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will never forget you. The Lord will not forget Zion You could point out that Isaiah sometimes writes in such a way that his words could be expressed by a variety of different people, including the Savior, Isaiah himself, ancient covenant Israel, or even modern-day covenant Israel. Because of this poetic style, Isaiah’s writings have wide applicability to different settings and circumstances. That is why Nephi felt very comfortable likening Isaiah’s words to himself and his people (see 1 Nephi 19:23 ). You might also explain to students that when He called Isaiah to preach repentance, the Lord knew the message would not be well received (see Isaiah 6:9–10 ). You could ask students how they would feel about a similar assignment. Read Isaiah 49:4–5 , thinking about why Isaiah may have felt this way. Then read them thinking about how God’s covenant people could feel this way. Even when we suffer, what do these verses help us remember about the Lord? Read Isaiah 49:13–16 , looking for what the Lord wanted His covenant people (Zion) to understand. How would you summarize this as a statement of truth? Students may use their own words, but help them recognize the truth that the Lord loves us and will never forget or forsake us. In preparation for the following journal activity, you might display images of the Savior on the cross and the nail prints in His resurrected hands. Consider playing quiet, sacred music to invite the Spirit as students write. Cross-reference or link Isaiah 49:16 with John 19:15–19 and 3 Nephi 11:10–15 . Slowly read these passages, marking words and phrases that help you feel the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for you. Look for teachings that help you understand why They will not forget or forsake you. To help students visualize what they read in John 19 and 3 Nephi 11 , you could show the videos “ Jesus Is Scourged and Crucified ” from time code 2:31 to 3:11 and “ Jesus Christ Appears at the Temple | 3 Nephi 11:1–17 ” from time code 2:23 to 4:57 from ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 4:45 5:38 He will not forget us In your study journal, write a paragraph that explains what the Savior saying “I have graven [you] on the palms of my hands” ( Isaiah 49:16 ) means to you. When truths in the scriptures are also taught by living prophets, students can more readily see the relevance of these teachings in their lives today. The following handout provides one way to help students make these connections. (For additional training on invitations that help connect students to the words of prophets, see “ Teach from the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets ” in Teacher Development Skills .) Consider using the handout “ I Will Not Forget Thee ” to help deepen students’ understanding that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will not forget them. You could place some or all of the quotes and scripture references from the handout around the room. Other helpful quotes are available in Additional Resources. Students could quietly move around the room, reading several of the quotes and scripture passages. They could add to the paragraph they wrote in their journals. As part of the activity, consider asking students to write on the board something they have learned in the lesson today. Students could read what others have written and add insights to their journal entry. Open PDF Share what you have felt When students have finished studying the handout, volunteers could share what they found meaningful from the quotes, scriptures, and personal insights. To conclude class, you could invite students to respond to the following questions either with a partner, in small groups, or with the class. What do you hope to remember from what you have learned and felt as you studied Isaiah 49 today? What is something you could do to remember that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will never forget you?",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 123 ---\nThrough Isaiah, the Lord spoke to His covenant people, both anciently and today. He extended beautiful promises to them if they chose to hearken to His loving invitations. As His covenant people, the Lord extends these same promises and invitations to us. This lesson can help students hearken unto the Savior’s invitations. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder when they or someone they know obeyed one of the Lord’s invitations or commandments and were blessed. The lesson will provide an opportunity for willing students to share. Possible Learning Activities Who do you listen to? Consider listing on the board the individuals mentioned below or others you feel are influential for teenagers. Parent, Friend, Teacher, Coach, Social Media Influencer, Celebrity Who do you think teenagers are most likely to listen to and follow their counsel? Why? Why does it matter who we listen to and follow? As students read the following verses, you may want to point out that writers in scriptures often repeated key words and ideas to emphasize important ideas. Your students can practice finding repeated key words and phrases with the following verses. Read Isaiah 51:1, 4, 7 , looking for who the Lord counseled His covenant people to listen to and follow. You may want to mark what you find. Invite students to share what they found. If students need help understanding the word hearken , consider explaining that President Russell M. Nelson taught that to hearken means “to listen with the intent to obey” (“ Hear Him ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2020, 89). Why might someone want to listen to and follow the Savior’s counsel over anyone else? Ponder any challenges, worries, or questions you might have in your life right now. Consider ways you could benefit from hearkening to the Savior’s counsel and invitations as you study Isaiah 51–52 . “Hearken to me” Read Isaiah 51:1–2 , looking for images and symbols that Isaiah used to describe an invitation from the Lord. Invite students to share what they found and what they feel these images mean. Explain that the phrases to “look unto the rock whence ye are hewn” and to look unto Abraham and Sarah ( Isaiah 51:1–2 ) refer to the Lord’s invitation to remember Abraham and Sarah, with whom God made His covenant (also called the Abrahamic covenant). This implies that we should remember to keep this same covenant with God. You could invite students to write the following incomplete statement in their study journal: As we keep our covenants with the Lord, He will … What does it mean to you to keep our covenants with the Lord? Read Isaiah 51:3 , looking for the blessings the Savior promises if we hearken to Him to keep our covenants. What did you find? Students could add … bless us with comfort, joy, and gladness to the incomplete statement. How do you think keeping our covenants with the Lord helps us receive His comfort, joy, or gladness? Invitations and blessings Create or display the following chart on the board. Students could also copy it in their study journals. As a model, you may want to add what students discovered in Isaiah 51:1–3 . For example, you could add “keep our covenants with the Lord” to the left column and “bless us with comfort, joy, and gladness” to the right column. Isaiah recorded many invitations and promises from the Lord in Isaiah 51–52 . Record the invitations and promises you find in your journal as you study these chapters. The Lord’s Invitations to His covenant people The Lord’s Promises to His covenant people The Lord’s Invitations to His covenant people The Lord’s Promises to His covenant people The handout “The Lord’s Invitations and Promises to His Covenant People” can help students identify and understand the Lord’s invitations and blessings to us. One way to help students study the handout is to organize them into small groups. Each group could select a portion of the handout to study and prepare to share what they learned. After sufficient time has passed, organize the class into new groups with students who studied a different set of verses. Each student can then share what they learned with their new group. Open PDF As groups discuss what they discovered, invite them to add to the chart on the board. Consider discussing specific invitations or blessings that students found meaningful. Questions like the following can help: What do these invitations teach you about what it means to keep your covenants? Which of the Lord’s blessings do you really want? Why? Which of the Lord’s invitations do you think will help you receive the blessing you seek? As students respond, listen carefully to what they say and think of ways to involve more students in the discussion. When teachers resist the tendency to respond to every comment and question and instead invite the class to respond, they can help create a pattern where students respond to each other. This can help the focus stay on the learners and increase student participation. One way to do this could be by asking follow-up questions like: Who has an experience that relates to what has been shared? What impressed you about that comment? (For additional training on resisting the tendency to respond to every comment and question, see: “ Resist the tendency to respond to every comment and question and invite the class to respond ” in Teacher Development Skills ). Hearkening to the Lord Invite students to think about what they have learned from their Father in Heaven through the Holy Ghost during the lesson. The following is one way you could do this. Ponder what you learned today and any invitations or counsel you feel Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ extended to you through the Holy Ghost. In your study journal, consider answering the following question: What do you feel the Lord is inviting you to do to receive His help with your challenges, worries, or questions?\n\n\n--- Lesson 124 ---\nOur mortal difficulties may cause us to wonder if anyone understands what we’re experiencing and if anyone can help us. Through His atoning sacrifice, Jesus Christ felt everything we may experience in mortality. Because of His Atonement, Jesus Christ can help us in our suffering. This lesson can help students feel gratitude for what the Savior has done for them through His Atonement. Student preparation: Invite students to work on memorizing the doctrinal mastery reference Isaiah 53:3–5 and the key scripture phrase “Surely [Jesus Christ] hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.” Possible Learning Activities Life experiences To help students consider what Jesus Christ experienced for them as part of His Atonement, consider writing, “ No one knows what it is like. No one understands ,” on the board. What are some experiences people may have that could cause them to think this way? Consider writing students’ answers on the board. Allow time for several students to share. Then, display the following prompt and questions. Ponder your answers to the following questions: What experiences have I had or might I have that could cause me to think this way? What do I do when I feel this way? Why? Encourage students to invite the Holy Ghost into their study as they learn about what the Savior has experienced and how He can help them. The Savior’s Atonement Through His Atonement, Jesus Christ perfectly knows and understands our life experiences. In Isaiah 53 , the prophet Isaiah taught about Jesus Christ’s atoning sacrifice. Isaiah 53:3–5 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Students can receive comfort and deepen their relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ through personal study of Isaiah 53 . The following activity is one way you could have students study Isaiah 53 . Read Isaiah 53:1–12 and Alma 7:11–13 , looking for: What the Savior experienced as part of His Atonement, and What the Savior can do for me because of His Atonement. You might want to create two columns on a blank page in your study journal to record what you find. What the Savior experienced What the Savior can do for me Some of the words and phrases in Isaiah 53 may be difficult for students to understand. If so, you may want to display the accompanying handout titled “ Understanding Isaiah 53 ” or provide it for students to refer to as they study. Alternatively, you might invite students to use footnotes or a dictionary to clarify unfamiliar words or phrases. As students study Alma 7:12 , it may be helpful for them to know that succor can describe how the Savior cares for us. “To succor means to ‘run to’” (Jeffrey R. Holland, “ He Hath Filled the Hungry with Good Things ,” Ensign , Nov. 1997, 66). Open PDF After giving students sufficient time to study, organize them into small groups. Invite them to discuss and summarize what they learned from their study. A few groups could share their summaries with the class. Students could identify truths such as: As part of His Atonement, Jesus Christ took upon Himself our sorrows, pains, sicknesses, afflictions, and griefs, and suffered for our sins. Through Jesus Christ and His Atonement, we can be forgiven and healed. The Savior’s Atonement is for me Reread Isaiah 53:3–6 silently to yourself, but this time, substitute your name, I , or my for the words our , we , and us . What did you learn or what did you notice that you didn’t before by personalizing these verses? If students could benefit from additional study about how the Savior personally experienced our suffering as part of His Atonement, you could also have students study the following statement from Elder Bednar. Consider displaying the statement from Elder Bednar and inviting students to look for words or phrases in the statement that help them understand the Savior and His Atonement. Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught about how deeply personal the Savior’s sacrifice was: 16:23 There is no physical pain, no spiritual wound, no anguish of soul or heartache, no infirmity or weakness you or I ever confront in mortality that the Savior did not experience first. In a moment of weakness we may cry out, “No one knows what it is like. No one understands.” But the Son of God perfectly knows and understands, for He has felt and borne our individual burdens. And because of His infinite and eternal sacrifice (see Alma 34:14 ), He has perfect empathy and can extend to us His arm of mercy. He can reach out, touch, succor, heal, and strengthen us to be more than we could ever be and help us to do that which we could never do relying only upon our own power. (“ Bear Up Their Burdens with Ease ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2014, 90) What would you say to someone who feels no one understands what they are going through? Try using words or phrases from Isaiah 53 , Alma 7:11–13 , and the statement from Elder Bednar. Reflecting on the Savior’s Atonement The following questions can help students reflect on their gratitude for the Savior’s Atonement. Help students respond to the questions by giving them a few minutes to ponder or write their answers. Giving students time to ponder can help them reflect on their relationship with Jesus Christ. Consider playing quiet, sacred music as students ponder or write their thoughts. Using what you learned today about the Savior and His Atonement, how would you respond to the following questions: Why is Jesus Christ the best person to turn to when you experience sorrow, grief, or pain? How have you or someone you know felt the Savior’s comfort while experiencing sorrow, grief, or pain? Invite students to share what they’ve pondered. As they share experiences, be sensitive and encouraging. Hearing another’s experience could prepare students to share their own. Consider sharing a personal experience or watching “ He Will Give You Help ” (4:43), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . This video shows how a young man found help overcoming grief through Jesus Christ and His Atonement. 4:43 Thank students for sharing their thoughts and feelings. You might also share your thoughts and feelings about the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Isaiah 53:3–5 is “Surely [Jesus Christ] hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 125 ---\nPeople may feel forsaken and alone at times. Sometimes, people may think that God is not there for them. Because the house of Israel broke the covenant they made with Jehovah, they were scattered. They may have felt that God had forsaken them. However, through the prophet Isaiah, the Lord reminded His covenant people, both then and now, that He would gather them with great mercies and give them peace. This lesson can help students feel the Savior’s love and commitment to them. Student preparation: Invite students to read Isaiah 54 , looking for words and phrases they would share with someone who feels alone or forsaken. Possible Learning Activities Feeling forsaken Consider beginning class with the following scenario. Students could select a version of the scenario to focus on individually or one for the entire class. Students will have an opportunity to respond to the scenario they chose at the end of the lesson. Carlos feels alone and forsaken because … He has sinned and doesn’t believe that God will forgive him for what he has done. He recently moved into a new area and is having a hard time making friends. He doesn’t feel like his prayers are being answered. Think about what you might say to Carlos to help him. Reflect on what you would want him to know about Jesus Christ. You may also want to invite students to think about their circumstances and how they have responded if they have felt alone or forsaken. To help students understand the context of Isaiah 54 , you may want to show students the image, “The Kingdoms of Israel and Judah at a Glance” as you explain the following paragraph (see also Lesson 88: 2 Kings 17; 24–25 ). Open PDF During Isaiah’s life, he witnessed the scattering of the Northern Kingdom of Israel because of its wickedness (see 2 Kings 17:6–23 ). He also prophesied that because of the wickedness of the Southern Kingdom of Judah, it too would be conquered (see Isaiah 39:5–7 ). Because of this, many in the house of Israel may have felt forsaken by God. In Isaiah 54 , Isaiah prophesied about what the Lord would do for His covenant people. The Savior later used this chapter to teach the Nephites how He would gather Israel in the last days (see 3 Nephi 22 ). As you study Isaiah 54 , listen for promptings from the Holy Ghost to help you know how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ feel about Their relationship with you. The Lord’s promises to His people You may want to remind students that Isaiah often used imagery in his writings. Pausing to think about lessons learned from the imagery he included can invite the Holy Ghost to teach us the Lord’s message in these scriptures. In Isaiah 54 , Isaiah used the imagery of a marriage relationship to teach about the Lord’s covenant relationship with the house of Israel. The husband represents the Savior, and the wife represents the house of Israel. You may want to divide the reading of the next set of verses into smaller segments, such as verses 1–4, 5–8, 9–10, 13, 17 . To help students better understand what they are reading, you could pause after each set of verses and invite students to ask questions. You can find information on certain words and phrases in these verses in the Additional Resources section. Carefully read Isaiah 54:1–10, 13, 17 , looking for what Jesus Christ promised His covenant people. What does the imagery of a husband and wife teach you about the Lord’s relationship with the house of Israel? What do the names and titles of the Savior in verse 5 teach about Him? You may want to allocate time to allow students to share meaningful words and phrases from these verses and discuss what they teach about the Lord. They could do this as a class or in small groups. Write Jesus Christ our Redeemer … on the board and invite students to complete the statement using what they find in Isaiah 54:4–10, 13, 17 . What are some ways you could finish the statement Jesus Christ our Redeemer … ? Students may finish the statement in many ways, including: Jesus Christ our Redeemer … will gather His people in mercy. has everlasting kindness for His people. will fulfill the covenant He made with His people. promises peace. When students see the scriptures as relevant to their lives, they are more likely to understand how the Savior’s doctrine applies to them personally. The following questions, or others you may think of, can help them discuss the relevance of the truths they identified. Which of these truths do you think could most help youth today? Why? Reflect on which of these truths is most meaningful to you personally. How do you think Jesus Christ fulfills these promises today? President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles testified: … In a world “tossed with tempest, and not comforted,” as Jehovah said it would be, how do we find what He called “the covenant of … peace”? We find it by turning to Him who said He would have mercy on us and “with everlasting kindness” would grant peace to our children. (“ Not as the World Giveth ,” Liahona , May 2021, 36) What are you learning about the way Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ feel toward you? To help students see an example of how the Lord gathers His people in mercy and helps them feel like they belong in His Church, consider watching the video “ Angels in the Mirror ” (5:47), located at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Afterward, invite students to share what impressed them. 5:46 Demonstrate learning The following activity intends to help students demonstrate what they learned and felt about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from studying Isaiah 54 . Select a method of responding that best meets the needs of your class. Some examples of what you could do include inviting students to role-play the situation, write a text message to send, or create a comic strip of a conversation with Carlos. Recall why Carlos feels forsaken and alone. Think of what you could share with him from what you learned in Isaiah 54 . Are there any personal experiences you might share with him? What do you want to remember about the Savior from your study of Isaiah 54 ? You may also want to share your testimony of the Savior and your thoughts and feelings while studying Isaiah 54 .",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 126 ---\nThe Lord has asked us to fast. How do you feel about this commandment? The Jews felt like the Lord did not acknowledge their fasting. Through Isaiah, the Lord taught the people about proper fasting. This lesson can help students feel a desire to fast in the Lord’s way. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder how they feel about fasting and why. They might also ask a parent or trusted friend to share their thoughts and feelings. Possible Learning Activities Fasting To help prepare students to learn about fasting, consider doing the following. As you discuss this topic, try to create an atmosphere where students can share openly without pressure or judgment. Imagine that one Sunday morning, you are ready to eat breakfast when you remember that it is fast Sunday. What are the first thoughts that enter your mind? If needed, share the following explanation of fasting from the General Handbook: The Lord has established the law of the fast and fast offerings to bless His people and to provide a way for them to serve those in need. … Fasting may be done at any time. However, members usually observe the first Sabbath of the month as a fast day. A fast day typically includes the following: Praying Going without food and drink for a 24-hour period (if physically able) Giving a generous fast offering A fast offering is a donation to help those in need. When members fast, they are invited to give an offering that is at least equal to the value of the meals not eaten. Members are encouraged to be generous and give more than the value of these meals if they can. ( General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 22.2.2., Gospel Library) Take a moment to ponder how you feel about fasting as you reflect on the following questions: How do you feel about fasting? Why? If you have fasted before, what have you learned about the Lord and fasting from your experience? What concerns or questions do you have about fasting? As you study today, seek the Lord’s guidance to help with any concerns you have and to feel a desire to fast. The Lord’s teachings about fasting The Lord directed Isaiah to boldly declare the sins of the house of Israel. For example, they outwardly performed religious practices, including fasting, with the wrong intent. Consider explaining or displaying any of the following information that might help students as they read the verses below: “Bulrush” ( verse 5 ) is a tall, thin grass that droops. “Sackcloth” ( verse 5 ) is coarse material that people wore anciently to symbolize their humility or sorrow. They also sprinkled ashes over themselves for the same reason. Read Isaiah 58:3–5 , looking for the answers to these two questions: What did the people ask the Lord about their fasting? What did the Lord tell the people they had done incorrectly regarding their fast? Invite students to share their answers and what stood out to them. If needed, point out that as Israel fasted, they sought their own pleasure ( verse 3 ), saw fasting as an affliction ( verses 3, 5 ), and treated others poorly ( verses 3–4 ). How might we make similar mistakes as we fast? Explain that the Lord intends for us to fast differently from these people. He intends that we fast with a humble attitude, purpose, and real intent (see Psalm 35:13 ; Joel 2:12 ; Jonah 3:4–10 ; Matthew 6:16–18 ; Alma 5:46 ; 6:6 ; 17:3, 9 ). Why do you think the Lord wants us to fast humbly, with a specific righteous purpose and real intent? Promises of the Lord Consider writing the following on the board: If we fast in the way the Lord intends, then… Read Isaiah 58:6–12 , looking for the purposes and blessings the Lord promises to those who fast as the Lord intends. You may want to mark them. Isaiah 58:6–7 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Ask students to complete the sentence based on their study. They may write their answers on the board. The following are some examples: He will loosen the hold of wickedness or sin upon us (see Isaiah 58:6 ). He will undo heavy burdens (see Isaiah 58:6 ). We will care for the poor and needy (see Isaiah 58:7 ). He will bless us with light and health (see Isaiah 58:8 ). He will answer our prayers (see Isaiah 58:9 ). The blessings of fasting To help students understand the blessings they identified, invite them to select one or two of the following situations: A young man is stressed out about his schoolwork and his future. A young woman feels like she can never be clean again because of her sins. A young man is praying to know if the Church is true but is struggling to receive an answer. A young woman wants to help the poor. A young man faces a challenge he doesn’t know if he can overcome. Find a phrase from Isaiah 58:6–12 that might motivate the person in the situation to fast and pray for God’s help. (Some situations may have more than one phrase that could apply.) In small groups or as a class, invite students to share the situations they selected and the phrases that could help and why. You might also invite them to share other situations in which the blessings the Lord promised in these verses may be helpful or ask if any of these blessings were especially meaningful to them and why. How might fasting for and receiving these blessings bring you closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Examples of fasting and paying fast offerings To help students understand the example of the Savior, explain that He fasted and taught about fasting while also living the principle. He fasted before his earthly ministry (see Matthew 4:1–2 and note that the Joseph Smith Translation for Matthew 4:1 adjusts the phrase “to be tempted of the devil” to “to be with God”). He also taught that some evil influences only depart “by prayer and fasting” ( Matt. 17:19, 21 ). Consider showing the following modern-day example of fasting and ask students what they liked or learned from it: “ Fast Offerings: A Simple Commandment with a Marvelous Promise ” (3:01): President Henry B. Eyring tells of a woman’s experience with fast offerings in Sierra Leone during a war. 3:2 Invite students to ponder their own experiences with fasting, as well as the following questions, for a few moments: What blessings has the Lord given you or those you know because of fasting? How do you or could you make your fast more meaningful? Consider sharing your own experiences as well. Your feelings about fasting Consider any impressions you have received through the Holy Ghost during this lesson as you write in your study journal how you feel about fasting. You may choose to include blessings from the Lord you want in your life and why. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for “ Isaiah 58:6–7 ” is “the blessings of a proper fast.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 127 ---\nThe Savior taught that the Sabbath was given to bless His people (see Mark 2:27 ). What blessings have you seen by honoring Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ on the Sabbath day? In Isaiah, we learn that if we honor the Father and the Son on Their holy Sabbath, the day will be a blessing to us. This lesson can help students honor the Lord on the Sabbath day. Student preparation: Invite students to reflect on what they already know about worshipping Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ on the Sabbath. They could make a list of things they feel they are doing well to make the Sabbath day holy. Possible Learning Activities How do you feel on the Sabbath? Giving students time to ponder their feelings about gospel truths can invite the Holy Ghost to help them identify things they do well and areas they might need to improve. Take a moment to think about how you feel on Sunday. Invite the Holy Ghost to help you remember some things you do on Sunday that may contribute to your feelings about the Sabbath. Then, answer the following questions in your study journal. How would you describe your current feelings about the Sabbath? What are some things you currently try to do (or not do) on the Sabbath? Do you feel that what you usually do on Sunday is helping you feel closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? As you study Isaiah 58:13–14 today, invite the Holy Ghost to help you recognize the blessings Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have promised as you worship Them on Their holy day. Honoring the Lord on His Sabbath Isaiah 58:13–14 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. During the seventh creative period, Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ rested from all Their labor. They blessed this day and established it as a time of sacred rest from earthly “work” (see Moses 3:3 ). Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have invited all of us to follow this pattern (see Exodus 20:8–10 and Deuteronomy 5:12–14 ). Through His prophet Isaiah, the Lord again commanded His people to dedicate the Sabbath day to Him. Help students identify some of the invitations the Lord gives us regarding the Sabbath by writing the following incomplete statement on the board: We keep the Sabbath day holy by … When the Lord gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments, He commanded that the Sabbath be set apart as a holy day to worship Him. Read Isaiah 58:13 , marking words and phrases that stand out to you. What are some ways the Lord has asked us to make His Sabbath a holy day? Help students use their own words to explain phrases in verse 13 that complete the statement of truth. You might help them identify phrases like: not pursuing our interests or desires seeing the Sabbath as a day of joy (delight) honoring Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ each Sabbath day The following activity could be done individually by students. Select a phrase in verse 13 . Think carefully about what it might look like to apply this phrase in your life. You might want to record a few of your thoughts in your study journal. As you ponder, invite the Holy Ghost to help you have a greater understanding of things you can do. It may be helpful to explain that keeping the Sabbath day holy is filled with personal choices. Avoid discussing the right and wrong ways to keep the Sabbath day holy and encourage students to avoid judging others for their choices. Blessings for honoring the Lord on His day Read Isaiah 58:14 , marking words and phrases that help us understand some of the blessings the Lord has promised to those who honor Him on His Sabbath. How would you explain these blessings in your own words? To help students identify the blessings the Lord has promised, you might need to share the meaning of phrases such as: “ Then shalt thou delight in the Lord ” – We will have joy in the Lord. “ I will cause thee to ride upon the high places and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob ” – The Lord promises blessings to His covenant people. It might be helpful to share that “ high places ” may refer to mountains, hills, strongholds, or holy places. This phrase may mean that “the Lord will bless His covenant people to rise above all obstacles, be protected and out of the reach of danger, be victorious over enemies (see Deuteronomy 33:29 ), and be closer to the Lord.” (“ Line upon Line: Isaiah 58:13-14 ,” New Era , Feb. 2016) You could invite students to add to the board the blessings they found. If students need additional help understanding the principles of Sabbath worship, you could invite them to look for additional blessings, such as those found in Ezekiel 20:20 and Doctrine and Covenants 59:9–13 . Why might someone struggle to see that it is a “delight” to keep the Sabbath day? What obstacles might they be facing? President Russell M. Nelson shared the following about what helped him overcome an obstacle he faced when making decisions about how to honor Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ on Sundays. 14:47 The Savior identified Himself as Lord of the Sabbath. It is His day! Repeatedly, He has asked us to keep the Sabbath or to hallow the Sabbath day. We are under covenant to do so. How do we hallow the Sabbath day? In my much younger years, I studied the work of others who had compiled lists of things to do and things not to do on the Sabbath. It wasn’t until later that I learned from the scriptures that my conduct and my attitude on the Sabbath constituted a sign between me and my Heavenly Father. With that understanding, I no longer needed lists of dos and don’ts. When I had to make a decision whether or not an activity was appropriate for the Sabbath, I simply asked myself, “What sign do I want to give to God?” That question made my choices about the Sabbath day crystal clear. (“ The Sabbath Is a Delight ,” Ensign or Liahona , Apr. 2015, 130) How might Isaiah 58:13–14 and President Nelson’s message help someone who is struggling with the obstacles you identified? Students could share appropriate experiences when they have felt blessed by their efforts to focus on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ on Sunday. The following questions could help students share their experiences. What have you found has improved your ability to honor the Lord on the Sabbath? What blessings have you seen from your efforts? What sign do you want to give to God? To help students make a plan to improve their Sabbath experience, display the following instructions. Take a moment to ponder what you have learned and felt today about the invitation in Isaiah 58:13–14 to set aside personal desires and honor Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ on the Sabbath. Invite the Holy Ghost to help you as you answer the following prompt in your study journal. To honor Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ on the Sabbath, I will . Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Isaiah 58:13–14 is, “Turn away … from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 128 ---\nIn Isaiah 61 , Isaiah taught about Jesus Christ’s mission in Heavenly Father’s plan to heal, free, comfort, and save us. Some people may be unsure if Jesus Christ is providing that help and comfort in our lives at times. This lesson can help students increase their confidence in the Savior’s ability to heal, free, and comfort us. Student preparation: Invite students to consider the evidence they have seen in their lives or the lives of others that Jesus Christ heals, comforts, and lifts people today. Ask them to come prepared to share their thoughts. Possible Learning Activities Our need for the Messiah To help students recognize our need for Jesus Christ, consider beginning class by displaying the picture depicting the woman from the New Testament who had an issue of blood (see Mark 5:24–34 ). Ask students to share what they know about her situation. If necessary, explain that she had a health concern, an “issue of blood twelve years” ( Mark 5:25 ). She “had spent all that she had” seeking a cure from physicians, but her illness only got worse ( Mark 5:26 ). Under the law of Moses, someone with an issue of blood was considered unclean (see Leviticus 15:19–33 ), so this woman was likely excluded from society in some ways during those 12 years. Ask the following questions while displaying the picture. Open PDF What do you imagine she could have thought or felt? How might a teenager experience similar thoughts or feelings today? Students can invite personal revelation to their study by thinking about their lives and circumstances. One way to help them do this could be to display instructions like the following: Think about the challenges you or someone you know is facing right now and how the Savior’s help is needed. Isaiah prophesied how the Savior could help us and this woman. As you study Isaiah 61 today, seek guidance from the Spirit to help you see how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are at work in your life. The mission of the Messiah To prepare students to study Isaiah 61 , write at the top of the board the following phrase: Heavenly Father sent Jesus Christ to … In Isaiah 61 , Isaiah prophesied of the Savior and His mission. In these verses, Isaiah speaks messianically or as if the Savior is saying the words. Read Isaiah 61:1–3 , and finish the statement on the board: Heavenly Father sent Jesus Christ to … You might want to explain that anointed in verse 1 means that Jesus Christ was set apart or sent with a specific purpose. “Christ (a Greek word) and Messiah (a Hebrew word) mean ‘the anointed’” (“ Jesus Christ ,” Guide to the Scriptures). You might also explain that meek in the context of verse 1 could mean poor, afflicted, or humble. What did you find that helps you understand how the Savior can help someone today? You could either write on the board what students share or invite them to do so. As students share, they might finish the following statement: Heavenly Father sent Jesus Christ to … Preach the gospel to the poor, afflicted, and humble (see verse 1 ). Heal the brokenhearted (see verse 1 ). Free the captive (see verse 1 ). Comfort all who mourn (see verse 2 ). Give beauty and joy to those weighed down (see verse 3 ). Asking follow-up questions is an effective skill to help students analyze what they have just studied in the scriptures or what they have heard someone share. You might consider asking follow-up questions such as the following to help students consider the meaning of the text: “In what ways might someone be captive?” or “What do you think it means that he will give us ‘beauty for ashes’?” Recognizing how the Savior fulfills His mission You might want to share the following summary of Luke 4:16–21 with students. During His life on earth, Jesus Christ read from Isaiah 61 at the synagogue in his hometown of Nazareth. Through Isaiah’s words, Jesus Christ testified that He was the promised Messiah sent by Heavenly Father with a mission to heal, free, comfort, and save (see Luke 4:16–21 ). To help students begin to see how the Savior can fulfill His mission in their lives, you could invite students to study examples from the scriptures in groups. Pick one of the statements on the board. Study an example in the scriptures where the Savior fulfills His mission by helping someone with their unique challenge. You can use the scriptural example provided or find your own. You might also think of a modern example. Afflicted: Man, sick of the palsy ( Mark 2:1–12 ) Brokenhearted: The woman with an issue of blood ( Mark 5:24–34 ) Captive: Alma the Younger ( Alma 36:16–21 ) Mourning: Mary and Martha ( John 11:20–36 ) Weighed down: Alma and his people ( Mosiah 24:8–21 ) As you study, look for answers to the following questions: What does this account teach you about how Jesus Christ can fulfill His mission for you in your life? What does this account teach you about how you can invite His power into your life? As students study, be available to help answer any questions they might have. After they have finished studying, you could invite students to share what they learned that could help someone who is facing a difficult challenge. Asking questions that invite students to reflect on personal experiences, such as the following, can help them recognize Jesus Christ’s love, power, and mercy in their lives. (For additional training on giving invitations that help learners recognize the Lord’s love, power, and mercy in their experiences, see “ Help learners recognize the Lord’s love, power, and mercy in their lives ” in Teacher Development Skills .) If students would benefit from seeing a modern-day example before sharing their experiences, you could watch Darlyn’s experience in “ Feeling the Lord’s Love and Goodness in Trials ” (4:18). 4:17 In what ways have you seen Jesus Christ fulfill His mission in your life or in the life of someone you know? Sharing what you believe about Him Give students time to process how the things they have learned can affect their lives outside of class. The following activity connects to the challenge they thought about at the beginning of class. Write a message to the person you were thinking about today who is currently experiencing difficulty in their life (this person could be yourself). Seek the help of the Spirit to guide you as you write. In the letter, share truths or experiences you have heard and learned about the Savior today that you think could encourage or bring hope to this person. Consider ending with your testimony of Jesus Christ and His power.\n\n\n--- Lesson 129 ---\nWith the world in turmoil, we all long for moments of peace. The Savior Jesus Christ will return to the earth and reign for a thousand years, ushering in a time of peace. Isaiah prophesied of this period, which is called the Millennium. This lesson can help students feel an increased excitement for the Savior’s Second Coming and millennial reign. Student preparation: Invite students to consider what they know about the Savior’s Second Coming and Millennium reign. Invite them to ponder if they look forward to it and why. They might ask a parent or trusted adult how they feel about the Savior’s return. Possible Learning Activities The Millennium To help students understand why the return of the Savior will be such a blessing in our lives, consider beginning by asking the following question: What are some problems in the world that you wish would change? You could write some of the following phrases on the board to help students think of answers: Reasons people weep or hurt Examples of violence, unfairness, or destruction The influence of Satan Take a moment to ponder any problems in your life or in the lives of those you love that you wish would change. As you study today, seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost as you look for truths that may help us and the world. The final chapters of Isaiah Show a picture of the Savior’s Second Coming and explain that the scriptures teach that in the future, the Savior will return to the earth and reign for a thousand years. This period is called the Millennium. Open PDF The final chapters in the book of Isaiah contain Isaiah’s teachings and prophecies about the Savior’s Second Coming and the Millennium. Read the following verses, marking phrases that help you feel excited for the Savior’s return: Isaiah 60:18–20 Isaiah 62:11–12 Isaiah 65:17–25 Invite students to share some of the phrases they found and why they look forward to the Savior providing this blessing. Students may share phrases that show that the Savior will overcome the world’s problems. Some examples are: “Violence shall no more be heard in thy land” ( Isaiah 60:18 ) “The days of thy mourning shall be ended” ( Isaiah 60:20 ) “The voice of weeping shall be no more heard” ( Isaiah 65:19 ) “They shall not hurt nor destroy” ( Isaiah 65:25 ) Encouraging students to mark phrases in the scriptures their classmates share may also be effective. How would you summarize what the Savior will do for His people when He returns? Students may share various truths. One may be similar to the following: Because of the Savior, His people will enjoy happiness, peace, and prosperity during the Millennium . Consider writing this principle, or one like it, on the board using students’ words. Deepening understanding Refer to the picture of the Savior’s Second Coming. Invite students to remember what they know and feel about Jesus Christ. Why do you think having Jesus Christ on the earth will lead to happiness, peace, and joy? Take a moment to ponder any questions you have about the Millennium and the blessings of the Savior’s return. The Lord has revealed more on the subject. Consider displaying the following questions. Select one or two of your own questions about the Millennium or the following questions you are most interested in. Spend several minutes looking for answers in the scriptures and divinely appointed sources. The section titled “Millennium” in Guide to the Scriptures and Topics and Questions on ChurchofJesusChrist.org may be useful. What does it mean that the Lord will “create new heavens and a new earth?” ( Isaiah 65:17 ). Read Doctrine and Covenants 88:25–26 and Articles of Faith 1:10 . Think of what these verses teach about the Savior’s power and His feelings for the righteous. Will there be death during the Millennium? What does it mean that because of the Savior a child “shall die an hundred years old?” ( Isaiah 65:20 ). Read Doctrine and Covenants 101:29–31 and ponder what these verses teach you about the Savior’s power. What will happen to Satan because of the Savior’s return? Read some of the following verses: Doctrine and Covenants 45:55 , 101:28 , 1 Nephi 22:26 , and Revelation 20:1–3 . Think of what these verses teach you about the Lord. What roles will the Savior have during the Millennium? What will he do? Read Doctrine and Covenants 29:11 and 45:59 and Articles of Faith 1:10 . What else has the Lord revealed about the Millennium? Read some of the following: Doctrine and Covenants 45:54, 56–58 ; 101:26–29 ; and “ Millennium ” in Topics and Questions on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Invite students to share what they learned. Consider asking how what they learned helps increase their excitement for the Savior’s return and the Millennium. If students ask what it means that Satan will be “loosed a little season” ( Revelation 20:3 ) at the end of the Millennium, invite them to read Doctrine and Covenants 88:111–115 . Visualizing what you learned Visualizing what you are learning can be effective at times. Close your eyes and visualize what you have learned about the Savior and when He reigns on the earth during the Millennium. Pray for the help of the Holy Ghost to make this activity meaningful for you. Picture the Savior returning and how He may bless you, your loved ones, and all mankind. You might read the following statement from Elder Andersen, inviting students to visualize what they hear. Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles testified: The thought of His coming stirs my soul. It will be breathtaking! The scope and grandeur, the vastness and magnificence, will exceed anything mortal eyes have ever seen or experienced. … He will appear “in the clouds of heaven, clothed with power and great glory; with all the holy angels” ( Doctrine and Covenants 45:44 ). … We will kneel in reverence, “and the Lord shall utter his voice, and all the ends of the earth shall hear it” ( Doctrine and Covenants 45:49 ) … There will be unforgettable reunions with the angels of heaven and the Saints upon the earth (see Moses 7:63 ). But most important, as Isaiah declares, “All the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God,” ( Isaiah 52:10 ) and He “shall reign over all flesh” ( Doctrine and Covenants 133:25 ). (“ Thy Kingdom Come ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2015, 122) Ask students to write in their study journals what they learned about the Savior today and how they feel about His return. Invite volunteers to share their thoughts and feelings. Consider sharing your thoughts and feelings as well.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 130 ---\nHave you ever wondered what happened in the premortal life that prepared you for your responsibilities in mortality? In the premortal life, Heavenly Father gave divine responsibilities to His children to perform in mortality. Examples of this include Jesus Christ (see 1 Peter 1:19–20 ) and Jeremiah (see Jeremiah 1:5 ). This lesson can help students feel a desire to fulfill their divine purpose. Student preparation: Invite students to imagine holding a newborn infant and to think about these two questions: Possible Learning Activities Prepare to learn To help students prepare to learn that Heavenly Father knows them and that He has a divine purpose for them, invite them to imagine the following situation. (You could adjust the situation to better fit your students. For example, it could be a teacher who challenges them to get a certain grade in a difficult class.) Imagine that a coach challenges you to work toward a difficult goal, such as running a mile under a certain time by a specific date. How would the following situations affect your desire to accomplish it and your confidence that you could achieve it? The coach, who knows you well, has worked with you for years and tailored the challenge specifically for you. A new coach who doesn’t know you has given the same challenge to the entire team. Display the following self-assessment to help students reflect on how perfectly Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ know them and their divine purpose. ( Note : Students will be invited to refer back to this self-assessment in Lesson 148: “ Assess Your Learning 9 .”) How would you evaluate yourself (1 – true of me; 10 – not true of me) on the following statements? Record in your study journal why you rated each statement how you did. I believe Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ know me better than anyone else knows me. I believe They have given me a divine purpose I can accomplish with Their help. I want to know and fulfill the divine mission Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have given me. Invite students to pay attention to thoughts and feelings from the Holy Ghost as they learn more about their divine purpose. “Before thou camest forth out of the womb … I ordained thee” To help students relate to Jeremiah, you could ask them how they might feel if the Lord asked them to do something difficult, such as speaking in church, teaching a lesson, serving a mission, and so on. Jeremiah may have felt similarly when the Lord called him to serve as a prophet to the kingdom of Judah. Students may be interested to know that Jeremiah prophesied in Jerusalem around the same time as Lehi (see 1 Nephi 7:14 ). Jeremiah 1:4–5 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Jeremiah 1:4–5 and the following statement from President Russell M. Nelson. Then, summarize what you learn about our relationship with the Lord. 14:25 Your spirit is an eternal entity. The Lord said to His prophet Abraham: “Thou wast chosen before thou wast born” ( Abraham 3:23 ). The Lord said something similar about Jeremiah and many others. He even said it about you. Your Heavenly Father has known you for a very long time. You, as His son or daughter, were chosen by Him to come to earth at this precise time, to be a leader in His great work on earth. You were chosen not for your bodily characteristics but for your spiritual attributes. … (“ Decisions for Eternity ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2013, 107) What truths can we learn from Jeremiah 1:4–5 and President Nelson’s statement? As students share, help them identify that before we were born, the Lord knew us and gave us specific responsibilities to perform in mortality. Consider inviting students to ask any questions they may have about this truth. If they ask questions that the Lord has not yet clearly answered, thank them for their thoughtful questions, but be careful not to speculate about answers. Statements in Additional Resources may help to answer student questions. For examples of others who were called to perform specific responsibilities in mortality, students could read one or more of the following: Luke 1:13–17 , 1 Nephi 11:14–20 , Mosiah 3:5–10 , Doctrine and Covenants 138:53–56 . Based on your students’ questions and needs, select one or more of the following three sections of the lesson you feel would best help them. Option 1: The Lord’s promises For the following scripture study, you might invite half the class to mark counsel the Lord gave and the other half to mark promises the Lord made. Then, have students find a partner who marked different things to share with. Then, discuss the questions below as a class. Read Jeremiah 1:6–9, 17–19 and mark the counsel and promises the Lord gave in response to Jeremiah’s feelings of inadequacy. How might the Lord’s promises to Jeremiah have helped him see his calling from an eternal perspective? What did the Lord tell Jeremiah that could help youth today with the responsibilities the Lord has given you? Option 2: Knowing my divine purpose matters To help students feel a desire to learn and fulfill their divine purpose, you could watch “ The Choice Generation ,” available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 5:43 to 7:14. It shows how one young man was blessed by knowing his divine purpose. 11:24 How would it help you to know what divine responsibilities the Lord has given you? Option 3: Learning my divine purpose Invite students to brainstorm in small groups as many different responses to the following question as they can in two minutes. Then, invite them to make a list on the board of the ideas they came up with. Students may share answers such as reading patriarchal blessings, prayer, personal revelation, counseling with loved ones, and magnifying callings. How can I learn about divine responsibilities the Lord has given me? Consider displaying the following statement. Invite each group to choose one of Elder Pingree’s four suggestions and discuss how following that suggestion could help a teenager understand the divine responsibilities that Heavenly Father has given them. Elder John C. Pingree Jr. of the Seventy shared four things we can do to understand what responsibilities the Lord has given to us: First, focus on others. … Second, discover and develop spiritual gifts. … Third, make use of adversity. … And fourth, rely on God. When we ask Him in faith with real intent, He will reveal our divine assignments to us. (“ I Have a Work for Thee ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2017, 33–34) The Lord knows me To help students share what they have learned and felt today, invite them to do the following. Encourage students to follow any promptings they may receive from the Holy Ghost as they do this. Using what you have learned today, write a message to your future self in your study journal. Write what you would want to remember about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ’s knowledge of you and the divine responsibilities They have given you. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Jeremiah 1:4–5 is, “Before I formed thee in the belly …I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 131 ---\nSimilar to today, worldly influences in Jeremiah’s time were strong. Many of the Lord’s people had fallen away from His teachings and would soon be conquered by their enemies. Despite their wickedness, Jeremiah was sent to teach that God still invited them to turn to Him and be healed. This lesson can help students increase their desire to turn to the Savior for mercy and healing. Student preparation: Invite students to find a scripture that teaches about the blessings of repentance. They could prepare to share why those blessings are meaningful to them. Possible Learning Activities Cisterns that hold no water To help students understand the condition of the people in Jeremiah’s time, explain that the Lord often helps us see spiritual truths by comparing them to things we are familiar with. Consider bringing to class a pitcher of water, a basin or large bowl, and a cup with a few small holes in the bottom. Hold up the pitcher of water as students read the following verse. Read Jeremiah 2:13 , looking for a title of the Savior that the water could represent. (A “cistern” is an area below ground created to store water.) What can the title “fountain (or spring) of living waters” teach us about Jesus Christ? Students might share such things as Jesus is a continual source of cleansing and spiritual replenishment. Invite a student to hold the cup over the basin (to ensure the water doesn’t spill) and pour some water from the pitcher into the cup. It might be helpful for students to look through verse 13 again before asking one or both of the following questions. What might pouring the water into the cup represent from the verse? What can the holes in the cisterns teach us about the spiritual condition of the people in Jeremiah’s day? Share with students that the people of Jeremiah’s time were turning to things of the world, such as false gods rather than the Lord, for purpose and strength in their lives. Reflect for a moment about how deliberate you are in turning to Jesus Christ for purpose and strength in your life. As you study today, be open to impressions or feelings from the Holy Ghost about turning to the Savior rather than other sources for blessings and healing. Feeling distant from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ To help students connect with the following scenario, consider displaying an image of a youth like the one shown. Invite students to come up with a name and a few details about him. Imagine there is a young man in your seminary class who feels his life is like a broken cistern because of poor choices he has made in the past. He feels distant from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and is not hopeful for things to get any better. Read Jeremiah 3:12–15, 22 , looking for descriptions of Jesus Christ that this youth would benefit from understanding. (It might be helpful to know that “backsliding” in these verses means faithless or wayward.) Consider writing the following incomplete statement on the board. Invite students to share ways to complete the statement using words or phrases from the verses. For those who repent and turn to the Lord, He will …” Answers might include “be merciful,” “not be angry,” ( verse 12 ), “bring you to Zion,” ( verse 14 ), “give you pastors (leaders) which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding,” ( verse 15 ), “heal your backsliding,” ( verse 22 ), and so on. It might be helpful to spend some time discussing any phrases from these verses that students have questions about. Invite students to record in their journals one or two phrases they think would be helpful for the young man in the scenario to understand about Jesus Christ. Students will have the chance to share what they choose later on. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ’s mercy To help students increase their confidence in the Lord’s desire to bless and heal those who turn to Him, you could share the following statement. Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught the following about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ’s desire to heal those who repent: Who among us has not departed from the path of holiness, foolishly thinking we could find more happiness going our own self-centered way? Who among us has not felt humbled, brokenhearted, and desperate for forgiveness and mercy? Perhaps some may even have wondered, “Is it even possible to go back? Will I be labeled forever, rejected, and avoided by my former friends? Is it better to just stay lost? How will God react if I try to return?”… Our Heavenly Father will run to us, His heart overflowing with love and compassion. … I bear witness that the moment you decide to return and walk in the way of our Savior and Redeemer, His power will enter your life and transform it. (“ The Prodigal and the Road That Leads Home ,” Liahona , Nov. 2023, 88) Write in your journal insights you have gained from this statement that could bless the young man in the scenario. You will have a chance to share these later on. If you didn’t use the video, “ The Savior Wants to Forgive ” in Lesson 77: “ 2 Samuel 11–12 ,” it could be shown here as an example of the Lord’s love and desire to bless and heal all who turn to Him. 5:50 Alternatively, you could show “ The Miracle of the Atonement ” by Elder C. Scott Grow of the Seventy, from time code 0:20 to 2:12 ( Ensign or Liahona , May, 2011, 108). 10:26 Invite students to respond to the following questions in small groups. What did you see in this person’s life that could be compared to the cup with holes in it and the pitcher of water from the beginning of class? What did you learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from this person’s life? Students could add in their journals any thoughts they think would be helpful to the young man in the scenario. Conclusion The following activity could be a good opportunity for students to feel the Holy Ghost testify of what they say and what they hear from other students. Consider displaying the following instructions. (The first point below gives students a chance to share what they did for their student preparation before class.) Prepare to share what you would say to the young man in the scenario by reviewing what you wrote in your journal. Consider including the following as well: Something from another scripture or scripture story that shows the blessings of repentance (You might look up repentance in the Topical Guide or Guide to the Scriptures .) Your feelings about the Savior’s love and desire to help all who turn to Him After students have had time to prepare, invite them to share their thoughts with a partner or small group. Once students have had the chance to share, you might conclude the lesson by inviting a few volunteers to share their responses to the following question. What have you learned or felt today that could influence your desire to turn to the Savior for His mercy and healing?\n\n\n--- Lesson 132 ---\nThe Savior asks us to participate in the greatest work on earth today: the gathering of Israel, which includes sharing His gospel. The gathering of Israel is so important that the Savior inspired ancient prophets such as Jeremiah to prophesy of it thousands of years ago. This lesson can help students participate in the gathering of Israel by sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder possible concerns Latter-day Saint teens might have with sharing the Savior’s gospel and ways to overcome those concerns. They can prepare to share their thoughts with the class. Possible Learning Activities The Savior’s power Consider beginning class by having students discuss the following question. If they need help, you could remind them of miracles they have studied in the Old Testament. (You might want to keep this discussion brief so you have enough time for the lesson.) What do you think are some of God’s greatest miracles or manifestations of power? If students didn’t mention parting the Red Sea, consider displaying a picture of Moses and the Red Sea. Explain that this event was so miraculous that for centuries people referred to it when teaching about the Savior’s mighty power (see Hebrews 11:29 ; 1 Nephi 4:2 ; Helaman 8:11 ). Think about the amazing miracles God has done in the past as you read the following statement from President Russell M. Nelson: So many wonderful things are ahead. In coming days, we will see the greatest manifestations of the Savior’s power that the world has ever seen. (“ Overcome the World and Find Rest ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 95) Read Jeremiah 16:14–15 , looking for something the Savior will do in the last days that will be even more monumental than His deliverance of Israel from Egypt. What did you discover? If students need help, you could explain that in these verses, Jeremiah prophesied of the latter-day gathering of Israel. As needed, explain that President Nelson taught that the gathering of Israel refers to “offering the gospel of Jesus Christ to God’s children on both sides of the veil” (in Russell M. Nelson and Wendy W. Nelson, “ Hope of Israel ” [worldwide youth devotional, June 3, 2018], Gospel Library). This lesson will focus on gathering Israel on this side of the veil. When you think about God’s plan for His children, why might gathering Israel be an even greater miracle than delivering Israel out of Egypt? Ponder your thoughts about the following questions: Is the gathering of Israel important to you? Why or why not? How do you feel about participating in it? Like He did through Moses, the Savior can manifest His miraculous power through you as you participate in the gathering of Israel. As you study Jeremiah 16 today, pay attention to any impressions you receive from the Holy Ghost. Ponder how the Savior can use you in this great gathering. Scattering and gathering In Jeremiah 16:10–18 , the Lord inspired Jeremiah to prophesy of the Israelites’ destruction, which came because of their rebelliousness. The Lord taught them that “their iniquity [was not] hid from [His] eyes” ( verse 17 ) and that He would send them a just punishment if they continued to rebel. Read Jeremiah 16:13 , looking for consequences the Israelites would experience because of their wickedness. Help students understand that Jeremiah prophesied that God would scatter the Israelites in Jerusalem into different lands because of their rebellion. This was fulfilled when many Israelites were taken captive into Babylon. During this time, the Lord also scattered righteous individuals, such as Lehi and his family, who were led to the American continent to preserve their lives from wicked people (see 2 Nephi 10:20–21 ). In Jeremiah 16:14–15 , Jeremiah then prophesied that in the latter days, the Savior would show His power to gather Israel back to Him and His Church. Consider inviting students to discuss the following with a partner or small group. Read Jeremiah 16:16 , looking for comparisons the Lord made about people who help gather Israel. Why might fishing and hunting be good comparisons for people who help gather Israel? What do you learn about our role in gathering Israel? Along with other truths students might share, help them see that Jesus Christ calls us to find scattered Israel and bring them back to Him. Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught the following about this great gathering: 13:48 The gathering is the ultimate recognition that “the worth of souls is great in the sight of God” [ Doctrine and Covenants 18:10 ]. It is as simple as that. We are gathering God’s children in these last days that they might have “blessings poured out upon their heads” [ 3 Nephi 10:18 ] and the promises of “the riches of eternity” [ Doctrine and Covenants 78:18 ]. It follows that to gather Israel we need missionaries. (“ How Great Will Be Your Joy ,” Liahona , Nov. 2023, 52) What does Elder Rasband’s statement teach you about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Participating in the gathering Students could provide answers to the following question. Consider inviting a student to list these answers on the board. What concerns might Latter-day Saint teenagers have about sharing the Savior’s gospel and gathering Israel? To help students address these concerns, consider displaying the instructions below. You could organize students into small groups, with each student working on a different study option. Once they finish, they could teach each other what they learned. Choose one of the following study options. Prepare to share which concern or concerns you feel the scripture passage best addresses and why. Read Jeremiah 1:6–9 , looking for what the Lord said when He called Jeremiah to share the gospel. Read Doctrine and Covenants 123:12, 16–17 , looking for what Joseph Smith taught the early Latter-day Saints that relates to sharing the gospel. Read Moses 6:32–34 , looking for what the Lord said when He called Enoch to share the gospel. Find a different scripture that you feel helps with any of the concerns on the board. Students could discuss the following questions as a class or in pairs or small groups. As you studied and tried to resolve a concern on the board, what did you learn about the Savior? How could what you learned about Him affect your desire to share His gospel with others? Make a plan Prepare students to make a plan for sharing the gospel. For example, you might show a video such as “ Simple Ways to Love, Share, and Invite for Youth ” (2:50), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Students could look for ways they can share the gospel. They could then share additional ways they can think of. 2:52 What experiences have you or people you know had with sharing the Savior’s gospel with others? You might want to share any experiences you have had. Then display the following statement so students can refer to it as they make their plan. President Russell M. Nelson extended the following invitation: There is nothing happening on this earth more important than gathering Israel for Him . Let your Heavenly Father know that you want to help. Ask Him to put you to work in this glorious cause. (“ Choices for Eternity ” [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 15, 2022], Gospel Library) In your study journal, make a personal plan for sharing the Savior’s gospel with others. Before making this plan, you might follow President Nelson’s invitation by prayerfully expressing your desires to help gather Israel for Heavenly Father. Consider including in your plan any impressions from the Holy Ghost that you might have received. For example, you might include who you would like to share the gospel with, such as individuals who are not members of the Church or who are not actively participating in the Church. Consider also including how and when you could share with them. Consider concluding with your feelings about the Savior and about helping bring souls to Him.\n\n\n--- Lesson 134 ---\nHow might someone act if they knew the gospel of Jesus Christ in their mind but didn’t feel it in their heart? Is it possible that they would act without feeling the power of the Savior’s love? How do our actions change when we feel Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ’s love in our hearts? Jeremiah 31 promises us that when we turn to the Lord, He will write His law in our hearts (see Jeremiah 31:18, 33 ). This lesson can help students understand what it means to have the Savior’s gospel written in their hearts. Student preparation: Invite students to ask family members and friends this question: “What is the difference between knowing a gospel truth in your mind and feeling it in your heart?” They could prepare to share what they discussed. Possible Learning Activities Knowing something in our minds and feeling it in our hearts To begin class, invite students to respond to the following question. What are some situations where we might know we should do something but struggle to actually do it? Students might share examples like getting to bed on time, making healthy eating choices, or completing homework before it is due. Help students understand that it is normal to struggle to align our actions with what we know is right. The same can be true when it comes to knowing and then acting upon what we know about the gospel of Jesus Christ. We might know what the Savior’s gospel requires, but we do not always live it. Nevertheless, we can strive to have the Savior and His gospel influence all we do. What we know about following the Savior is not always reflected in our actions. Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles asked a question we might sometimes have in these situations: How can you make the gospel of Jesus Christ not just an influence in your life but the controlling influence and, indeed, the very core of what you are? (“ When Thou Art Converted ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2004, 11) As you study Jeremiah 31 , invite the Holy Ghost to help you look for ways you can make the Savior’s gospel “the very core of what you are.” Jeremiah foretells the Savior’s blessings to Israel For this study activity, you could organize students into groups of three. Invite each group member to read one of the following passages and to share their answers to the questions with the others in the group. After warning of the consequences that the wicked would suffer in the last days (see Jeremiah 30:23–24 ), Jeremiah prophesied that the Lord would again gather His covenant people to Him. Read the following passages, looking for what the Lord will do for His people: Jeremiah 31:1–3 Jeremiah 31:6–10 Jeremiah 31:17–20 What are some of the promises you found? What do these invitations teach about the Lord? Read Jeremiah 31:31–33 , looking for how the Lord will demonstrate His loving-kindness to His covenant people. How would you summarize this teaching as a statement of truth? Help students identify that the Lord promises to gather us to Him as His covenant people and to write His law in our hearts. What do you think it means to have the Lord’s law written in our hearts? Students might share a variety of ideas. Help students understand that the phrase written in our hearts (see verse 33 ) can refer to being converted, experiencing a change, and desiring to accomplish the will of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ with all their heart. You may want to point out that Paul used a similar metaphor when he described the Saints in Corinth as an “epistle of Christ … written not with ink … or in tables of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart” ( 2 Corinthians 3:3 ). Is the Savior’s gospel written in your heart? Display the following two questions. Invite students to select one they feel could increase their understanding of what it means to have the Lord write His law in their hearts. How do I know that the Savior’s law is written in my heart? What are some things I can do to invite the Savior to write His law in my heart? Organize students into small groups with others who selected the same question. Ask students to imagine they have a friend who has asked the question they selected. Invite students to prepare a response they could share with this friend. To help students prepare a response you could provide each student with a copy of the handout “The Savior Will Write His Law in Your Heart.” Open PDF Demonstrate understanding Consider giving students a chance to practice answering the question they selected. You could organize students with those who studied the other question. You might invite students to share how what they learned could help someone more consistently do what they know is right. To help students demonstrate what they have learned and felt, consider displaying the following instructions. In your study journal, answer one or more of the following questions: What evidence will you look for that the Lord is writing His law in your heart? What is something you feel prompted to do to invite the Savior to write His gospel in your heart? You might also ask willing students to share experiences they have had recognizing that the Savior has written His law in their hearts. You could share how you have seen the Lord writing His law in your heart. Encourage students to ask the Lord for help and to act on the impressions they receive.\n\n\n--- Lesson 135 ---\nThe scriptures are an essential part of our connection to Jesus Christ. Learning from the scriptures points our thoughts and hearts toward Him, which invites His power into our lives. During a time of apostasy, the Lord instructed the prophet Jeremiah to write and send the Lord’s words to the people of Judah so they might turn toward Him and be forgiven. This lesson can help students understand how the scriptures turn them to Jesus Christ to be forgiven of sin. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to review their personal scripture study goals and progress on the required reading for the year. You could also invite students to reflect on how their scripture study is helping them turn to the Lord. Possible Learning Activities Speaking up Think of a way to help students prepare to learn about how the Lord uses scriptures to lovingly correct us and bring us to Him. One way to do this is to have students think of situations where it might be uncomfortable to speak up. As needed, you could use the following situations. How might someone who cares about you respond in the following situations? After eating lunch, your friend notices you have some food in your teeth. You are invited to a party that will have inappropriate activities. Your friend is aware of the activities but knows you are looking forward to going. What might motivate someone to speak up in these situations? What might be the result of saying something or remaining silent? Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ know and see things we do not. They desire the best for us, and they speak to us through the scriptures (see 2 Nephi 32:3 ; Doctrine and Covenants 1:37–38 ). As you learn today, ponder ways the scriptures can bless your life. Consider how these ideas could influence your personal study. A purpose of scripture Read Jeremiah 36:1–3 , looking for why the Lord commanded Jeremiah to record His words for the people of Judah. What did the Lord want for the people of Judah? What do these verses teach us about some purposes of scripture? Students might identify a truth like the scriptures help us turn to the Lord and receive His forgiveness. You might want to invite students to mark the phrases “that they may return every man from his evil way” and “that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin” ( verse 3 ). They could write the truth they discovered near these phrases in their scriptures. How do the scriptures help us turn to the Lord and receive His forgiveness? Consider listing student’s responses on the board. As students share, they might refer to ideas found in the following scriptures. You might want to become familiar with these scriptures so you can go to them as students share. Alternatively, after students share a few responses to the previous question, you could provide the following instructions and have them add to the ideas on the board. Read the following scripture passages, looking for additional ways the scriptures help us turn to the Lord and be forgiven of our sins. 2 Timothy 3:16 Alma 37:8 Helaman 15:7 Questions that help students assess what they are learning can help you identify when they are ready to move on to the next portion of the lesson. For example, you could ask questions such as the following: What are you learning? What questions do you have about what you read? Student responses could invite the Holy Ghost to help you discern how to respond to their needs. For additional training on asking questions to assess learning, see “ Always be ready to respond to spiritual promptings about the needs of learners ” in Teacher Development Skills . The king and the scroll You might summarize or read the following paragraph. Jeremiah did what the Lord commanded and asked a man named Baruch to write the Lord’s words on a scroll. Because Jeremiah was imprisoned, he asked Baruch to read the Lord’s words to the people of Judah, including several princes. After doing so, Baruch gave the scroll to the princes to read to Jehoiakim, the king of Judah (see Jeremiah 36:4–10, 14–15, 20–21 ). Read Jeremiah 36:20–24 , looking for how King Jehoiakim reacted to hearing the words on the scroll. In verse 23 , “he” refers to King Jehoiakim. Why do you think the king reacted this way? Read Jeremiah 36:25 , looking for how certain princes tried to influence the king. Invite students to imagine that they were the princes in verse 25 . Using what they have learned in class today, ask students to prepare a response to the king that would help him understand how the scriptures could bless his life. One way to do this activity is to organize the class into groups of three. Each student could represent one of the princes, with groups preparing their responses together. Then you could invite a group to come to the front of the class and role-play their interaction with the king. You might invite another student to act in the role of king or you as the teacher could play that role. You might suggest that students role-play an alternative ending to the story where the king is persuaded not to burn the scroll. What is a modern situation where the teachings from your response might help a youth? Reflect on what you have learned You could share the following statement to help students reflect on what they learned from their study of Jeremiah 36 . Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught: Through the scriptures, God does indeed “show forth his power” [see Alma 37:14 ] to save and exalt His children. By His word … He enlarges our memory, sheds light on falsehood and error, and brings us to repentance and to rejoice in Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. (“ The Blessing of Scripture ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2010, 33) It might help to give students time to ponder or record their response to the following question before they share with the class. How might it affect your personal study to know the scriptures can help you turn to the Lord and receive His forgiveness and guidance? This could be a good opportunity for students to reflect on their personal study goals and the required reading for seminary credit. Consider inviting students to review their goals and to think about how they might focus more on turning to Jesus Christ as part of their personal scripture study.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 136 ---\nBecause the Savior is filled with compassion, He is willing to heal, comfort, and forgive, even when we sin against Him. After Jerusalem was destroyed because of sin and rebellion, Jeremiah sought to help the Jews understand the Savior’s compassion and to find hope in it. This lesson can help students feel the Savior’s compassion for them, even when they sin. Student preparation: Invite students to recall a story from the scriptures that demonstrates the Savior’s compassionate nature. Students will have a chance to refer to this story in the lesson. Possible Learning Activities After we sin Consider beginning class by sharing the following scenario. Alternatively, you could show the video “ Painted into a Corner ” from time code 0:00 to 1:47. This video is available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . You could show the rest of the video later in the lesson. 3:41 Imagine a young man has done his best to make good choices in his life. One day while attending a party, he gives into peer pressure and drinks alcohol because he wants to fit in. The next morning, he wakes up feeling alone, guilty, and frustrated. He slowly begins making other poor choices and starts losing hope for his future. Write students’ responses to the following questions on the board. The written responses will be referenced throughout the lesson. When people sin, how might they see or feel about themselves? How might they see or feel about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Invite students to ponder the following questions to evaluate their own feelings. Have you ever thought any of the statements on the board? Which of these statements do you know are false? Which are you unsure about? It is important to remember that we all sin and “come short of the glory of God” ( Romans 3:23 ). As you study Lamentations today, look for impressions from the Holy Ghost that can help you recognize how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ feel about you, even when you make mistakes. Sorrow for sin Consider displaying the following picture. Invite students to share what they see in this image or how it makes them feel. Explain that this image shows Jeremiah and his great sorrow. Students could share what they remember about the story of Jeremiah and why he would have felt sorrow. As needed, share details from the following paragraph. For about 40 years, the Lord told Jeremiah to prophesy to the house of Israel about Jerusalem’s destruction and captivity if they chose not to repent and turn back to God (see Jeremiah 16:1–13 ). During the reign of King Zedekiah, the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and brought many people into captivity, fulfilling the Lord’s prophecy (see Jeremiah 52 ). Sometime after these events, Jeremiah recorded the book of Lamentations. You might want to explain that the term lamentation refers to expressions of deep sorrow or grief. The following activity could help students understand the suffering the Lord’s people experienced. You might organize students into pairs or small groups to study the scripture passages. Explain that Jeremiah wrote most of these verses from Jerusalem’s perspective as if the city itself were speaking. Read one or two of the following passages, looking for words or phrases that express how the people felt after suffering because of their sins. Lamentations 1:1–4 Lamentations 1:16–18 Lamentations 1:20–22 What words or phrases did you discover? To help students examine what they discovered from an eternal perspective, you could ask the following question. Knowing that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love us, why do you think They allow us to experience this kind of suffering when we sin? If students need help answering this question, you could invite them to read passages such as 2 Corinthians 7:9–10 ; Alma 42:18, 29 ; Doctrine and Covenants 95:1 , looking for possible answers. The Savior’s compassion The remainder of the lesson can help students feel the compassion the Savior has for us even when we sin. You could organize students into pairs to study the following passages and answer the accompanying questions. For example, one student could study verses 22–26 , and the other verses 31–33 . Reflect on the statements on the board from the beginning of the lesson. Read Lamentations 3:22–26, 31–33 , looking for words or phrases you would share with someone who feels this way. What words or phrases would you share? Why? What truth from these verses would you want them to understand? As students share, they might identify the following truth: The Lord has compassion for us, even when we sin. If students need help understanding the word compassion , you could share the following definition: “In the scriptures, compassion means literally ‘to suffer with.’ It also means to show sympathy, pity, and mercy for another” (Guide to the Scriptures, “ Compassion ,” Gospel Library). To better understand the Savior’s compassion, students could do the following activity. Instead of studying one of the following options, students could think of and study a different story from the scriptures that demonstrates the Savior’s compassion. Complete one of the following study options, looking for what helps you better understand how you can experience the Savior’s compassion in your life. Study one of the following stories that demonstrate the Savior’s compassion: Matthew 18:23–35 ; John 8:1–11 . Study one or two of the following scripture passages that teach about the Savior’s compassion: Mosiah 15:7–9 ; Doctrine and Covenants 64:2–4 ; Doctrine and Covenants 101:9 . Consider inviting students to teach each other what they learned and felt. You could invite willing students to share with the class. The following testimony might also help with this discussion. Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles testified: 15:45 Jesus Christ can forgive because He paid the price for our sins. Our Redeemer chooses to forgive because of His incomparable compassion, mercy, and love. Our Savior wants to forgive because this is one of His divine attributes. And, like the Good Shepherd He is, He is joyful when we choose to repent. Even as we feel godly sorrow for our actions, when we choose to repent, we immediately invite the Savior into our lives. (“ Repentance: A Joyful Choice ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2016, 123) Feeling the Savior’s compassion for me When have you or someone you know experienced the Savior’s compassion? (Remember not to share past sins or anything that is too personal.) Remind students of the young man from the beginning of the lesson. What would you share with this young man based on what you learned today? Consider finishing the video “ Painted into a Corner ,” from time code 1:48 to 3:41. Or if you did not show the first half of the video yet, consider showing the entire video. Students could look for evidence that the Savior showed compassion for the young man. Invite students to share what they found. 3:41 You may want to conclude with your testimony, thoughts, or feelings about the Savior.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 138 ---\nHow can we stay safe with so many spiritual dangers in the world? The Lord calls prophets to serve as watchmen to warn and protect us. The Lord called Ezekiel to serve as a watchman for the Israelites while in Babylonian captivity (see Ezekiel 3:16–17 ). This lesson can help students feel a greater desire to heed the warnings of the Lord’s prophets. Student preparation: Invite students to read “ Prophet ” in Guide to the Scriptures or “ Prophets ” in Topics and Questions in Gospel Library. They could look for the role of prophets and reflect on how they see prophets fulfill this role. Possible Learning Activities Feelings about the Lord’s prophet Consider beginning class by inviting students to reflect on their feelings about the Lord’s prophet today. One way to do this could be to display an image of the President of the Church and invite students to sing or listen to “ We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet ” ( Hymns, no. 19 ). You could then provide the instructions below. Acknowledge that students’ feelings about the prophet might vary from one another, and that is OK. Encourage them to respond honestly. 96:16 In your study journal, complete the following statement with one or more responses: When I see the prophet, listen to him speak, or read his words, I feel … Invite willing students to share with the class what they wrote. You might explain that as they share and listen, the Holy Ghost can enlighten their minds and soften their hearts to follow the Lord’s prophet. The Lord calls Ezekiel as a prophet Ezekiel had been captured and taken to Babylon along with other Israelites. While in captivity, he was visited by the Lord and called to be a prophet (see Ezekiel 1–2 ). The Lord promised to strengthen Ezekiel as he preached to a rebellious and hard-hearted people (see Ezekiel 3:7–9 ). Ezekiel 3:16–17 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Ezekiel 3:10–11, 16–17 , looking for what the Lord taught Ezekiel about his role as a prophet. What did you find? To help students understand the imagery of a watchman, consider displaying the image of Carcassonne included in this lesson, along with this statement from Elder Neil L. Andersen. Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained: 16:4 Carcassonne is a remarkable walled city in France that has stood since medieval times. Tall towers surge upward from its protected walls, built for watchmen who stood on those towers day and night, keeping their attention riveted in the distance for the enemy. When the watchman saw an enemy approaching, his warning voice protected the people of Carcassonne from the impending danger they could not see. A prophet is a watchman on the tower, protecting us from spiritual dangers we may not see. (“ The Prophet of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 25) How could you summarize what Ezekiel 3:16–17 and Elder Andersen teach about prophets? Help students identify that the Lord calls prophets who serve as watchmen to warn us of spiritual dangers . Explain that the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles serve as the Lord’s prophets today. If students completed the student preparation activity, they could share what they learned as part of the following discussion. Why is “watchmen” a good way to describe the role of prophets? In Ezekiel 33 , the Lord again taught Ezekiel his responsibility to serve as a watchman and share God’s message with Israel (see Ezekiel 33:1–7 ). Read Ezekiel 33:9–11 , looking for why the Lord wants to warn His people. What can verse 11 teach us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared how prophetic warnings are evidence of God’s love: 15:15 Far from being anxious to condemn, our Heavenly Father and our Savior seek our happiness and plead with us to repent, knowing full well that “wickedness never was [and never will be] happiness” [ Alma 41:10 ]. So Ezekiel and every prophet before and since, speaking the word of God out of a full heart, have warned all who will to turn away from Satan, the enemy of their souls, and “choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men” [ 2 Nephi 2:27 ]. (“ The Voice of Warning ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2017, 108) How can understanding why the Lord calls His prophets to be watchmen influence our desires to follow them? Warnings from the watchmen The following activity is intended to help students see examples of warnings the Lord has given through His prophets. Consider inviting students to choose one of the following options to study: Recent talks from members of the First Presidency or Quorum of the Twelve Apostles These doctrinal mastery scripture passages or other passages of your choosing: Isaiah 5:20 ; 1 Corinthians 6:19–20 (see also verse 18 ); 2 Nephi 2:27 ; 2 Nephi 32:8–9 ; Alma 41:10 ; and Doctrine and Covenants 64:9–11 After students have chosen an option to study, display the following instructions: Study teachings from the Lord’s prophets and prepare to share the following: Warnings the Lord has given through His prophets. Blessings we can receive or challenges we can avoid by heeding these warnings. These could be from what you studied or from your thoughts and experiences. How you feel this warning is evidence of God’s love or His desire for us to be happy. You could invite each student to select one prophetic warning they found in step 1 of their study and write it on the board. As another option, students could write the warning on a piece of paper and post it around the room. Invite students to read the warnings others have written. The class could then select a few to discuss in greater detail. You could ask the students who wrote the selected warnings to share their answers to steps 2 or 3 from their study. As students listen and participate in the discussion, invite them to reflect on their personal circumstances and needs. Encourage them to consider whether the Lord has specific warnings or messages for them. Following the prophet Reflect on thoughts and feelings the Holy Ghost may have communicated to you throughout the lesson about the Lord and His prophets. Add one or both of the following lines to your study journal and complete them with your thoughts or feelings: Something I want to remember about the Lord and His prophets is … I want to follow the Lord’s prophet because … You could conclude by asking a few students to share what they wrote. You could also share feelings you have had about the Lord and His prophets as you prepared and taught the lesson. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Ezekiel 3:16–17 is “The prophet is ‘a watchman unto the house of Israel.’” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 139 ---\nWe all feel lost, broken, sick, or needy at times. Heavenly Father sent Jesus Christ to “bind up that which was broken” and “strengthen that which was sick” ( Ezekiel 34:16 ). In Ezekiel 34 , the prophet Ezekiel likens how a good shepherd cares for his flock to how Jesus Christ cares for Heavenly Father’s children. This lesson can help students follow the Savior’s example to seek out and care for others. Student preparation: Invite students to think of ways that “the Good Shepherd” ( John 10:11, 14 ) is an appropriate name for Jesus Christ. They could ponder how this name for the Savior helps them understand His love and desire to care for Heavenly Father’s children. Possible Learning Activities A symbol for the Savior Consider sharing the following experience and statement. Invite students to identify actions of the shepherd that are symbolic of the Savior’s love for them. Alternatively, you could show “ Shepherds of Israel ” from time code 1:07 to 4:09. 9:15 On a trip to Morocco, Elder John R. Lasater of the Seventy learned about Jesus Christ’s love for Heavenly Father’s children when a sheep was hit by a royal car, entitling the shepherd to a large compensation. Elder Lasater’s interpreter said the shepherd wouldn’t accept the money. Elder Lasater then shared what happened next: Startled, I asked him why. And he added, “Because of the love he has for each of his sheep.” It was then that I noticed the old shepherd reach down, lift the injured lamb in his arms, and place it in a large pouch on the front of his robe. He kept stroking its head, repeating the same word over and over again. When I asked the meaning of the word, I was informed, “Oh, he is calling it by name. All of his sheep have a name, for he is their shepherd, and the good shepherds know each one of their sheep by name.” (“ Shepherds of Israel ,” Ensign , May 1988, 74) What can you learn about Jesus Christ from the actions of the shepherd? As you study today, seek the help of the Holy Ghost to learn how we can follow the example of Jesus Christ to care for Heavenly Father’s children. Shepherds In Ezekiel 34 , the Lord compared the leaders of Israel to shepherds who were not taking care of their flocks. Read Ezekiel 34:1–6 , marking phrases the Lord used to describe the Israelite leaders. What do you learn about the Lord from His concerns expressed in these verses? To help the leaders of Israel better care for their flocks, Jesus Christ described how He cares for His flock (see John 10:11, 14 , where Jesus also describes Himself as “the Good Shepherd”). Consider displaying a picture of Jesus Christ depicting Him as a shepherd, like the picture at the beginning of this lesson. On the left side of the picture, consider writing “ As the Good Shepherd, the Savior … ” Students could summarize what they mark in Ezekiel 34:11–16 under this heading. Read Ezekiel 34:11–16 , marking phrases that describe what Jesus Christ does for Heavenly Father’s children. Summaries students provide from the verses could include: Seeks out those that are lost ( verses 11–12, 16 ) Delivers them from darkness ( verse 12 ) Nourishes them and provides for their needs ( verses 13–15 ) Binds up the broken ( verse 16 ) Strengthens the sick ( verse 16 ) You might invite students to share some stories from the scriptures of how the Savior demonstrated some of these actions toward Heavenly Father’s children. To help students reflect on their efforts in following the Savior’s example to care for others, consider displaying the following self-assessment. Compare what you have marked in the two sets of verses you have studied in Ezekiel 34 , then ponder how you would respond to the following questions: What are some ways you feel you are like the Savior? Are there ways where you might be more like the shepherds in Israel? What are possible obstacles you face in caring for others like the Savior? Caring for His sheep Consider writing “ I can follow the Savior’s example by … ” on the right side of the picture of the Savior. Place students in small groups and provide the following instructions. Using what you found in Ezekiel 34:11–16 , make a list of practical ways youth can care for others as the Savior does. Some possible ideas students might come up with could be the following: Visiting with someone they haven’t seen in a while (“I will both search my sheep, and seek them out” [ Ezekiel 34:11 ]) Being generous with their time or resources (“I will feed my flock” [ Ezekiel 34:15 ]) Inviting someone to participate in an activity with you (“I will… bring again that which was driven away” [ Ezekiel 34:16 ]) Being aware of physical or emotional needs of others (“I will… bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick” [ Ezekiel 34:16 ]) After making this list in groups, you may want to have each group list one of their ideas on the board. After there are several ideas listed on the board, it may be helpful to have students discuss the following questions: What can make it difficult to do these things? How can the Savior help you overcome these difficulties? Consider displaying the following questions and inviting students to select at least one to answer. As students reflect on personal experiences, the Holy Ghost can help them feel the truth and importance of what they are learning. How has the Savior blessed you or your family by sending someone to seek out and care for you? How has the Savior used you or your family to seek out and care for others? If you feel it would help students to see an example of youth caring for others as Jesus does, consider showing “ Face to Face with President and Sister Oaks (Strive to Be) ” from time code 57:50 to 59:55, available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . In this video, youth share ideas on how they seek out and care for others. 80:11 Make a plan Making a plan in class to act on what they have learned can help students deepen their conversion to Jesus Christ. Take a moment to think of people in your life who may be like the sheep (lost, scattered, broken, weak) in Ezekiel 34 . These might be people in your class or quorum, your family and friends, or people at school. Seek the Holy Ghost’s help in considering who might need your help. From the ideas we’ve discussed, or another you feel inspired to do, write how you can follow the Savior’s example to seek out and care for this individual. To remind yourself of your plan, you could write it down on a piece of paper or set it as a reminder on your phone. You may want to plan a few minutes in an upcoming lesson to follow up with students about their plans and check on their progress. To conclude, you could share how someone has cared for you or how you have cared for others as the Savior does.\n\n\n--- Lesson 140 ---\nIn Ezekiel 37 , Ezekiel saw a future gathering and reuniting of all the tribes of Israel to the Lord (see Ezekiel 37:20-28 ). Modern prophets have also interpreted Ezekiel’s vision as the stick of Judah (the Bible) and the stick of Joseph (the Book of Mormon) being united as companion testaments of Jesus Christ and His restored gospel (see Ezekiel 37:15–17 ). This lesson can help students understand ways the Bible and the Book of Mormon work together as witnesses of Jesus Christ and His gospel. Student preparation: Invite students to imagine they are asked, “Why do you need the Book of Mormon if you believe in the Bible?” and prepare to share how they would respond. They could ask a friend or family member how they would respond to the question. Possible Learning Activities A sure second witness Imagine you see a social media post that asks, “Why do you need the Book of Mormon if you believe in the Bible?” You could invite students to ponder this question while you write it on the board. Then, invite students to ask themselves: How confident do you feel in your ability to answer this question? If a friend were to ask you this question, what would you share? As you study Ezekiel 37 today, invite the Spirit to help you recognize ways the Bible and Book of Mormon testify of Jesus Christ and His gospel. At the end of the lesson, you will have a chance to practice responding to this question. The stick of Judah and the stick of Joseph The prophet Ezekiel was sent to preach repentance to the Israelites who were captives in Babylon. In Ezekiel 37 , the prophet recorded a vision in which the Lord taught that the House of Israel, spiritually dead because of apostasy, would return to life through the Restoration of the gospel. As part of the vision, Ezekiel saw two sticks or wooden tablets upon which messages would be written. As students study the following passage, you may want to point out that the “stick of Judah” refers to the Bible. The “stick of Joseph” refers to the Book of Mormon (see Guide to the Scriptures, “ Ephraim ”; “ Judah ”). Students could include this information as a note in their scriptures next to verse 16 . Ezekiel 37:15–17 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Ezekiel 37:15–20 , looking for the Lord’s promise about the scriptures in the latter days. What do you think the phrase “they shall become one in thine hand” ( verse 17 ) could mean? To help us understand how the Bible and the Book of Mormon would become “one” testament of the Savior, President Russell M. Nelson taught: 14:33 The Bible and the Book of Mormon are both witnesses of Jesus Christ. They teach that He is the Son of God, that He lived an exemplary life, that He atoned for all mankind, that He died upon the cross and rose again as the resurrected Lord. They teach that He is the Savior of the world. Scriptural witnesses authenticate each other. This concept was explained long ago when a prophet wrote that the Book of Mormon was “written for the intent that ye may believe [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also” ( Mormon 7:9 ). Each book refers to the other. Each book stands as evidence that God lives and speaks to His children by revelation to His prophets. … Today, Saints living in many nations of the earth gratefully hold the Bible (the stick of Judah) and the Book of Mormon (the stick of Ephraim) bound as one in their hands. (“ Scriptural Witnesses ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2007, 43, 44) How would you summarize what we learn from Ezekiel 37:15–20 and President Nelson? Although students may use different words, help them share a truth such as the Bible and the Book of Mormon both witness of Jesus Christ . Why do you think it’s important to have both the Bible and Book of Mormon witnessing of Jesus Christ? Companion witnesses of Jesus Christ The following activity could help students increase their understanding of how the Bible and the Book of Mormon both testify of Jesus Christ and His gospel. You could provide some or all of the chart below. Students could select one or more topics to study individually, with a partner, or in a small group. Gospel Topic Companion Scriptures Gospel Topic The Atonement of Jesus Christ Companion Scriptures Bible: Isaiah 53:3–5 Book of Mormon: Alma 7:11–13 Gospel Topic Resurrection of all because of Jesus Christ Companion Scriptures Bible: 1 Corinthians 15:20–22 Book of Mormon: Alma 11:42–45 Gospel Topic The Savior promises to gather and redeem His people Companion Scriptures Bible: Ezekiel 37:21–23, 26–27 Book of Mormon: 1 Nephi 10:14 Gospel Topic The attributes of Jesus Christ Companion Scriptures Bible: Isaiah 63:7 Book of Mormon: Mosiah 4:11 Gospel Topic The Savior’s ordinance of baptism Companion Scriptures Bible: Matthew 3:13–17 Book of Mormon: 2 Nephi 31:5–12 Gospel Topic You choose a topic Companion Scriptures Bible: Book of Mormon: Open PDF Think of a way to help students share what they have learned. One way to do this is to provide the accompanying handout for students to use to create a social media post. If students are unfamiliar with social media, you can adapt this activity to have students role-play what they would share with someone. The activity invites students to answer the question posed at the beginning of the lesson. Select one of the topics you studied and create a social media post that could be used to answer the question, “Why do you need the Book of Mormon if you believe in the Bible?” Include the verses from the Bible and Book of Mormon you studied. Explain the value you find and how they both teach about Jesus Christ and His gospel. Share what you have learned You could tape the students’ posts or posters on the wall around the room or place them on desks. Then, invite students to walk around the room and review their classmates’ work. Provide small papers or sticky notes for students to use as they complete the following instructions. Write a “comment” to one or more of the other social media posts. In your comment, complete at least one of the following options: Add an additional scripture reference from either the Bible or the Book of Mormon that could help someone understand more about the Savior and this topic. Include a few thoughts about the value of the scripture you shared. Share how the Bible and the Book of Mormon have helped you understand the Savior and this teaching. Write an experience you have had when scriptures from the Bible or Book of Mormon helped increase your testimony of the Savior and His gospel. Instead of writing your thoughts on a paper, share something you have learned today about the Savior and His gospel teachings on your personal social media account. Include scripture passages and how the Bible and Book of Mormon have helped you better understand the gospel of Jesus Christ. You could conclude the class by inviting students to continue to use the Bible and the Book of Mormon to increase their understanding of Jesus Christ and His gospel. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for “ Ezekiel 37:15–17 ” is “The Bible and the Book of Mormon shall become one in thine hand.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 141 ---\nThe Lord gives us many blessings through our worship in the temple. Ezekiel saw in a vision a latter-day temple that will be built in Jerusalem. He saw water flowing from this temple, healing the surrounding land and bringing life to the Dead Sea. The vision symbolizes the blessings the Lord gives us as we worship Him in His temple. This lesson can help students feel a greater desire to worship God in the temple. Student preparation: Consider giving students the following questions and inviting them to come prepared to share their answers: Possible Learning Activities Desire to worship in the temple Begin the lesson in a way that helps students think about their desire to attend and worship in the temple. To do this, you could display a picture of a temple. Then, write students’ answers to one of the following questions on one side of the temple and their answers to the other question on the other side. What are some reasons a teenager may want to attend and worship in the temple? What are some reasons they may not want to attend the temple? What might make it difficult? Self-assessment questions can help students identify opportunities for personal growth and learning. Invite students to take a moment to ponder the following questions about themselves. How strong is your desire to worship in the temple? Why? What may keep you from wanting to attend the temple? As you study Ezekiel today, seek the Lord’s help to increase your desire to attend and worship in the temple. Ezekiel’s vision of the temple Note: To help students feel the Lord’s love, it is important in this lesson to refer to blessings as coming from the Lord through the temple, not from the temple itself. In Ezekiel 47 , Ezekiel saw a vision that could symbolize the blessings the Lord gives to all who do temple and family history work. It began with a heavenly messenger bringing Ezekiel to the temple door in Jerusalem. Read Ezekiel 47:1 , looking for what Ezekiel saw coming from the temple. How might water be a fitting symbol for the blessings of the Lord? Some possible answers might include that water gives life, is needed by everyone, cleans, and is available to all. During His mortal ministry, the Savior compared Himself and the blessings He offers to living water (see John 4:10 ; 7:37–39 ). It may be useful for the following activity to explain that a cubit is a unit of measurement, from the elbow to the tips of the fingers, approximately 18 to 21 inches or 45 to 53 centimeters. Read Ezekiel 47:2–5 , looking for how deep the water became as it flowed out of the temple. Because the Lord’s teaching in this account is very visual, it can help to draw what we are learning. On the top half of a page in your study journal, draw a simple representation of a temple and the water coming from it. (You will draw more of where the water goes in the bottom half later.) If useful, students could watch “ And the River Will Grow ,” available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 0:26–1:29. 3:43 What do you think the Lord was teaching in this vision about the blessings He gives through the temple? Ask students: If you were to draw something on your picture to symbolize where nothing lives or thrives, what would it be, and why? If the same question were asked to those in Jerusalem in Ezekiel’s day, the answer may likely be the Judean wilderness or the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea has its name because of its inability to sustain animal or plant life. It also contains salt water and is undrinkable. If useful, show or direct students to the picture “ Judean Wilderness ” (Bible Photographs, no. 3) in Study Helps in the Gospel Library or in the Bible Appendix to see the wilderness by the Dead Sea. They could also look at “ Physical Map of the Holy Land ” (Bible Maps, no. 1) and find the Wilderness of Judea and the Dead Sea. Read Ezekiel 47:8–9, 12 , looking for what would happen to everything the water from the temple touched, including the Dead Sea. Invite students to complete their picture, drawing what they just read in the bottom half of their paper. The following is an example of an open-ended question that helps learners discover gospel doctrine and principles for themselves. This approach can make students’ study of the scriptures more relevant and allow the Lord to teach and inspire them personally. (For additional training on this skill, see: “ Create open-ended search questions that help learners discover gospel doctrine and principles for themselves and do not lead students to a specific response ” in Teacher Development Skills .) How would you summarize what you learned from Ezekiel’s vision? Students may share a variety of principles. Thank them for their responses and ask why what they learned is important. One of the principles students could identify is: As we worship the Lord in the temple, He blesses us with healing, new life, and growth. Students may want to write this principle or one they identified in their scriptures next to Ezekiel 47:1–9 . If useful for further understanding, continue the video of Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and his family from time code 1:58–2:33. 3:43 Deepen your understanding Prepare a copy of the handout “ Blessings of the Temple ” for each student. Read the handout “ Blessings of the Temple ” and underline or circle any blessings that stand out to you. Open PDF On their drawings, students can write these blessings in the water coming from the temple. They can also add any additional blessings they can think of that the Lord gives us through the temple. Consider inviting students to share their drawings and written blessings with a partner or small group. Alternatively, you could draw the river on the board and ask students to write the blessings they thought of there. Students can then add to their drawings blessings they would like to remember from what others shared. What blessings stood out to you? Invite students to think of answers to the following questions for a few moments before you ask them. As they share, you might ask questions such as the following: “Why is that meaningful to you?” “Has anyone else had a similar experience?” and “What would you like to add to what has been shared?” If students live in an area where many have not attended the temple because of distance, and they do not know many people who have attended the temple, consider altering the second question to ask about blessings students or others have experienced as they have prepared to worship in the temple. How might any of the blessings you identified heal or give life? When have you or those you know experienced one of these blessings from the Lord through worshipping in the temple? If students would benefit from seeing other examples of some blessings available from temple worship, you could show one of the following videos: “ Temples Are a Beacon ” (2:50) 2:50 “ Family History and Temple Work: Healing and Sealing ” (14:43) from time code 7:36–12:20. 14:43 How you feel about the temple To conclude the lesson, consider finding a place on your picture or in your study journal to write your feelings about attending and worshipping in the temple and receiving the Lord’s blessings. Seek the help of the Holy Ghost to write your feelings well and accurately. Consider inviting any students who would like to share their thoughts and testimony. Consider sharing your own as well.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 142 ---\nWhen we encounter situations that test our resolve to obey the Lord’s commandments, do we give in or stand firm? As servants in King Nebuchadnezzar’s court, Daniel and his friends were instructed to break the Lord’s revealed health laws, but they stood firm. This lesson can help students strengthen their commitment to obey the Lord’s Word of Wisdom. Student preparation: Invite students to study the overview for “ Word of Wisdom ” in Topics and Questions in Gospel Library. Encourage them to discuss how they or others have been blessed by keeping the Lord’s Word of Wisdom. Possible Learning Activities What would you do? Consider beginning class by describing a young person who loves to accept challenges to try new things, like the following example. You might change the name and activities to make them more relatable to your students. Mateo is an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has a reputation for trying new things, so his friends often give him challenges such as the following: Once a friend challenged him to run a marathon. Mateo took the challenge. Once a friend challenged him to dive into an ice-cold lake. Mateo took the challenge. Once a friend challenged him to introduce himself to a new girl at school. Mateo took the challenge. After reading the next challenge, pause and ask the question below. One day Mateo’s friends challenge him to drink alcohol at a party. How do you think Mateo might respond? Why? You might ask students if pressure to break the Word of Wisdom is common in your area. They could also describe situations where they might feel pressure to break it. Consider encouraging students who might have broken this commandment to remember that the Lord will help them as they turn to Him and repent. Reassure students that the Lord loves them and invites them to keep trying. To evaluate their own commitment to obey the Word of Wisdom, students could answer the following in their study journals. How do you think you would respond in a similar situation? Why? How do you think you would respond if you were offered something more common like coffee or tea? As you study Daniel 1 today, listen for thoughts and feelings Heavenly Father might give you through the Holy Ghost. Look for ways to strengthen your commitment to obey the Lord’s Word of Wisdom. Daniel obeyed the Lord Around 606 BC, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, attacked Jerusalem and took certain Israelites captive into Babylon. The king commanded that some of the Israelite youth be trained for service in his household. Among these youth were four young men named Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. In Babylon, their names were changed to Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego (see Daniel 1:1–7 ). As students read the following verses, consider pausing after verse 10 to ask the questions below. Alternately, you could invite students to follow along in their scriptures as you show the video “ God Gave Them Knowledge” (available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org ) from time code 0:52 to 5:15, pausing at time code 4:18 to discuss the questions. 13:49 Read Daniel 1:5, 8–14 , looking for what the king instructed Daniel and his friends to do. Why might this request have been challenging for Daniel and his friends? Why do you think not eating and drinking certain things would be worth risking the king’s anger? You might remind students that in Daniel’s time, Israelites followed the law of Moses, which included certain dietary restrictions (see Deuteronomy 14 ). You might also explain that “pulse” refers to “foods made of seeds, grains, etc.” ( Daniel 1:12 , footnote a ). Blessings of obeying the Lord To help students discover how the Lord blessed Daniel and his friends, you could organize students into partnerships. As they read the following verses, invite one partner to look for how the Lord blessed Daniel and his friends physically, and invite the other partner to look for how the Lord blessed them spiritually. Then invite partnerships to share what they found. Have them mark the physical and spiritual blessings in two distinct ways (such as highlighting with different colors or underlining one and highlighting the other). Read Daniel 1:15–20 , looking for how the Lord blessed Daniel and his friends for their obedience. When students identify attributes and characteristics of Jesus Christ, they can increase their desire to trust and obey Him. One way to help students do this is by creating search questions, like the following, for students to ponder. (For additional training on creating search questions to help students identify attributes and characteristics of Jesus Christ, see “ Create Search Questions to help students identify roles, titles, symbols, and attributes of Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills .) Read verses 15–20 one more time, but this time ponder what you learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. What do these verses teach you about God? How could this understanding strengthen your desire to trust and obey Him? You might explain that like in Daniel’s day, the Lord has revealed a health law for His children today. It is known as the Word of Wisdom (see Doctrine and Covenants 89 ). The following activity could help students study the Word of Wisdom. Consider providing paper and art supplies as well as copies of For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices for students without access to Gospel Library. You might limit time spent on this activity to allow time for the experience at the end of the lesson. Imagine that you have been asked to create a poster that describes something unique about your religion. You decide to create your poster about the Word of Wisdom. Use some or all of the following sources to determine what to include: Doctrine and Covenants 89:18–21 Daniel 1:15–20 “Word of Wisdom” in the Guide to the Scriptures or Topics and Questions (Gospel Library) or in the “ What about … ? ” section of For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices (2022) “ The Word of Wisdom: What It Is, What It Isn’t ,” New Era , Aug. 2019, 26–28 Be sure to include a statement of truth about the Word of Wisdom on your poster. This truth can be from Daniel’s experience or from other sources. Invite students to share their posters and statements of truth with the class. Among the truths they might share, emphasize the following: As we keep the Lord’s commandment to obey the Word of Wisdom, He will bless us physically and spiritually. ( Note: In Lesson 160: “ Assess Your Learning 10 ,” students will look back on the posters they created. It might help to collect the posters or to display them until you teach that lesson so that students will have access to them.) People who don’t yet understand the purpose of the Word of Wisdom might view it as unnecessary restrictions that the Church imposes. Take a minute to ponder blessings that come from keeping the Word of Wisdom and the results of breaking it for individuals, families, and society. How do you think the Word of Wisdom shows God’s love for His children? Commit now to obey the Lord To help students strengthen their commitment to obey the Lord’s Word of Wisdom, you could invite them to complete the following sentences in their study journals. As they prepare to write, ask them to consider how their commitment to obey the Word of Wisdom can strengthen their relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. I want to obey the Word of Wisdom because … One thing I can do that will help me obey the Word of Wisdom is … You might conclude by sharing your testimony of Jesus Christ and the blessings you’ve seen from obeying His Word of Wisdom.\n\n\n--- Lesson 143 ---\nThe Lord showed Daniel a vision of the latter days, when the Lord would set up His kingdom upon the earth. The Lord’s kingdom, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will fill the earth and stand forever. This lesson can help students strengthen their testimony of the divine Restoration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Student preparation: Invite students to choose one of the following ideas to prepare for this lesson: Possible Learning Activities Testimony of the Restoration Consider inviting students to share any questions they remember that are asked during a temple recommend interview. If helpful, you could point to the temple recommend questions in the appendix of For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices . After students have shared a few questions they remember, you could write the following question on the board. Think about how you would respond to the following temple recommend question: Do you have a testimony of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ? As needed, explain that the Restoration is “God’s reestablishment of the truths and ordinances of His gospel among men on earth” (Guide to the Scriptures, “ Restoration of the Gospel ,” Gospel Library). Consider writing Why or why not? after the question on the board. Invite students to ponder their answers to both questions. As you study Daniel 2 today, invite the Holy Ghost to help you recognize truths that can strengthen your testimony that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ restored The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the earth. King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream To help students understand the context of Daniel 2 , a student could read or summarize the following information. Alternatively, you could watch “ God Gave Them Knowledge ,” available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 6:17 to 13:00. 13:49 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had a dream that troubled him. None of his wise men could tell him what the dream was or how to interpret it. As a result, the king commanded that all his wise men, including Daniel, be killed. Before that could happen, God revealed the dream and its interpretation to Daniel (see Daniel 2:1–26 ). Before sharing what God had revealed about the dream, Daniel taught the king that God was the source of the interpretation. Daniel also revealed that the dream was about “what shall be in the latter days” ( Daniel 2:28 ). Consider placing students in small groups. Give each group a copy of the handout titled “ King Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream .” Then display the instructions below, giving students time to complete step one before displaying step two. Read Daniel 2:31–43 and label the elements of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream on the handout with the interpretations you discover. Include the verses where you found the interpretations. Help students identify that King Nebuchadnezzar’s Babylonian kingdom was the head of gold ( verse 38 ). The other parts of the image (or statue) represent other kingdoms that would come after Babylon. Daniel 2:44–45 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Daniel 2:44–45 , looking for words and phrases that describe the stone. Write these words around the stone on your handout. As students read the following statement, invite them to write what the stone represents inside the stone on their handout. Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained what the stone represents: The Church [of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] is that prophesied latter-day kingdom, not created by man but set up by the God of heaven and rolling forth as a stone “cut out of the mountain without hands” to fill the earth [ Daniel 2:45 ; see also verse 35 ]. (“ Why the Church ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2015, 111) What can we learn about God’s restored Church from this statement and from the Lord’s revelation to Daniel? Using students’ words, help them identify that God established The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which will fill the whole earth and stand forever . Consider sharing that the Lord Himself declared that His gospel would fill the whole earth (see Doctrine and Covenants 65:2 ). Students could cross-reference or link Doctrine and Covenants 65:2 to Daniel 2:35 . You might explain that “filled the whole earth” ( Daniel 2:35 ) does not mean that everyone will join the Lord’s Church, but that it will spread throughout the earth (see 1 Nephi 14:12–14 ). How do the phrases in Daniel 2:44–45 help us understand this truth? The stone rolls forth After interpreting King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, Daniel shared his testimony that it was “certain, and the interpretation thereof sure” ( Daniel 2:45 ). As we develop our personal testimonies, the truths of the Savior’s restored Church can become certain and sure to us through the power of the Holy Ghost. President Russell M. Nelson shared what we need to do to develop sure testimonies for ourselves: Now, as President of His Church, I plead with you. … Do the spiritual work to find out for yourselves [that the Savior’s Church has been restored], and please do it now. Time is running out. (“ Come, Follow Me ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 91) The following activity can help students consider what spiritual work they need to do to strengthen their testimony of the divine Restoration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Consider placing students in small groups to do the activity. Help students find the Restoration proclamation . It can be found in Gospel Library and in some study journals. You might provide paper copies for students who don’t have access to it. As an alternative to the proclamation, you could show “ Hear Him ,” available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 17:05 to 22:55. 24:24 Read “ The Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: A Bicentennial Proclamation to the World .” Look for truths the Savior has revealed and events He has brought forth in restoring His Church. Discuss why these truths and events are important to the Restoration of the Savior’s Church. Discuss the spiritual work someone could do to strengthen their testimony that Jesus Christ restored His Church. After sufficient time, have each group share one truth or event that stood out to them. Invite them to share why it’s important to have a testimony of this truth or event and the spiritual work someone could do to gain or strengthen their testimony of it. After each group has had the opportunity to share, invite students to answer the following questions in their study journals. What truth or event of the Savior’s restored Church would you like to strengthen your testimony of? What spiritual work can you do to strengthen your testimony of the Savior’s divine Restoration of His Church? Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Daniel 2:44–45 is “God shall ‘set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed.’” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 144 ---\nSometimes the Lord might miraculously deliver us from our trials. Other times He might not deliver us in the way or with the timing we hope. Either way, we can strive to be like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego and trust in the Lord, regardless of how and when He chooses to bless us. This lesson can help students feel a desire to trust in Jesus Christ regardless of the outcome. Student preparation: Invite students to think of faithful disciples of Christ who were miraculously delivered from their trials. Then have them think of other faithful disciples who were not delivered. They could ponder what these accounts teach them about trusting in the Lord. Possible Learning Activities Exercising faith in Jesus Christ Consider beginning class by sharing the following story about Elder Bowen’s son, Tyson. Note: The video version of the statement includes additional information that is not included in the written statement. Elder Shayne M. Bowen of the Seventy shared the following personal experience: 11:26 When [my son] Tyson was eight months old, he aspirated [or inhaled] a piece of chalk that he had found on the carpet. The chalk lodged in Tyson’s throat, and he quit breathing. His older brother brought Tyson upstairs, frantically calling, “The baby won’t breathe. The baby won’t breathe.” We began to administer CPR and called 911. The paramedics arrived and rushed Tyson to the hospital. In the waiting room we continued in fervent prayer as we pled to God for a miracle. (“ Because I Live, Ye Shall Live Also ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2012, 16) How might different potential outcomes of this situation affect the family’s faith in God? Elder Bowen continued: 11:26 After what seemed a lifetime, the doctor came into the room and said, “I am so sorry. There is nothing more we can do. Take all the time you need.” She then left. As we entered the room where Tyson lay, we saw our lifeless little bundle of joy. … At that moment it felt as if our world had come to an end. (“ Because I Live, Ye Shall Live Also ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2012, 16) Like the Bowens, you might have experiences where God does not bless you in the way that you had hoped. Ponder experiences you or your family have had where you felt the Lord either blessed you or did not bless you with the outcome you wanted. It might help to display the following questions. Ask yourself the following questions: How have your experiences influenced your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Do you feel you can trust in Them, regardless of the blessings you do or do not receive? Why or why not? As you study Daniel 3 today, pay attention to any impressions from the Holy Ghost that can help strengthen your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ no matter the outcome. A difficult decision Consider writing the following names on the board: Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego . Display the image of a golden idol and invite students to share what they know about this account. You might want to summarize the context below in your own words. The king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, made a large golden image, or statue. It was approximately 90 feet (27.4 meters) high and 9 feet (2.74 meters) wide (see Daniel 3:1 ). The king commanded everyone to fall down and worship the image when certain music was played (see Daniel 3:4–5 ). People who did not worship the golden image would be thrown into “a burning fiery furnace” ( Daniel 3:6 ). Considering the consequences for not worshipping this image, ponder what you think you would have done if you were there. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego chose to honor God by not worshipping the image (see Daniel 3:12 ). To help students study the following verses, you could invite five willing students to read the roles of Nebuchadnezzar, Shadrach, Meshach, Abed-nego, and a narrator. The students who read for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego could each read one verse in Daniel 3:16–18 . Read Daniel 3:13–18 , looking for what you learn from these men about faith in Jesus Christ. What lessons do you learn about faith in Jesus Christ? Help students see that we can show our faith in Jesus Christ by trusting in Him, regardless of the outcome . Consider inviting students to mark the phrase “is able to deliver us” ( verse 17 ). Point out that knowing God can bless us with what we hope for shows faith in Him. Then invite students to mark the phrase “but if not” ( verse 18 ). Ask students what they learn about faith in God from these men’s willingness to accept that God might not choose to bless them with what they hoped for. What is the difference between having faith in Jesus Christ versus faith in an outcome? What are modern situations where someone would need to show faith in Jesus Christ rather than faith in an outcome? The outcome of our faith Consider displaying the picture of the fiery furnace from the beginning of the lesson. Students could study the following verses and discuss the questions below in pairs or small groups. Read Daniel 3:19–28 , marking words or phrases that impress you from what Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego experienced. To help students visualize these verses, you could show the video “ Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego ” (1:39), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 1:39 What impressed you from this story? What do you learn about God from this account? It might help to explain that even though God delivered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, He might not always deliver us from negative outcomes. To demonstrate this, students could complete the following activity. Think of scriptural accounts where people exercised faith in Jesus Christ and still experienced negative outcomes. Consider writing But if not … on the board. Students could then list underneath this phrase the people they thought of. If time allows, they could search the accounts of these people in the scriptures, looking for evidence that these people trusted in God. The following are examples you could refer students to as needed: Nephi (see 1 Nephi 18:10–16 ), Abinadi (see Mosiah 17:9–20 ), Joseph and Hyrum Smith (see Doctrine and Covenants 135:1 ), or various righteous individuals (see Hebrews 11:36–40 ). How do these accounts help you trust in the Lord regardless of the outcome? What do you know about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that helps you want to trust in Them regardless of the outcome? Depending on Christ Consider reminding students of Elder Bowen’s experience. The following statement can help them see how he trusted in the Lord despite the outcome he experienced. Elder Bowen continued sharing his experience: As I felt the guilt, anger, and self-pity trying to consume me, I prayed that my heart could change. Through very personal sacred experiences, the Lord gave me a new heart, and even though it was still lonely and painful, my whole outlook changed. I was given to know that I had not been robbed but rather that there was a great blessing awaiting me if I would prove faithful. My life started to change, and I was able to look forward with hope, rather than look backward with despair. … I testify that because of Him, even our Savior, Jesus Christ, those feelings of sorrow, loneliness, and despair will one day be swallowed up in a fulness of joy. I testify that we can depend on Him. (“ Because I Live, Ye Shall Live Also ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2012, 17) How can Elder Bowen’s experience help you? When have you or someone you know shown faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ by trusting in Them regardless of the outcome? In your study journal, write what helps you want to trust in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ regardless of the outcome. You could include how the lessons you learned from Daniel 3 can help you in the trials you face or what you hope to remember in the future. You could invite willing students to share. Consider concluding with your own testimony or feelings about trusting in the Lord.\n\n\n--- Lesson 145 ---\nWhat story from the Old Testament has taught you a meaningful gospel principle? Jesus Christ Himself used the Old Testament to help His disciples understand His teachings (for example, see Luke 4:24–27 ). One powerful story that illustrates many gospel truths is the account of Daniel’s faith and trust in the Lord, even when facing the lions’ den. This lesson can help students identify and share gospel truths from Daniel 6 . Student preparation: Invite students to reflect on the scripture stories they have learned from the Old Testament in their study this year. They could select a story that has been meaningful to them and prepare to share a gospel truth that story helped them understand. Possible Learning Activities The moral of the story To help students practice identifying the moral of a story, select a local fable or popular folktale. For example, you could use a story like “The Ugly Duckling.” As an alternative, you could show the video “Things That Matter Most” from time code 0:00 to 0:22, available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Then ask the following questions: 0:33 What message could this story teach? How could that message illustrate a truth about Jesus Christ or His gospel? Just as we can find truths in common fables and stories, we can learn to find important gospel truths in the inspired scripture accounts that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have preserved for us. To help us understand how scripture stories teach gospel truths, Elder Jay E. Jensen of the Seventy taught: As you read and study [scripture] stories, you will see a word, a phrase, or a principle that seems as applicable today as it was in the past. As you continue your prayerful study, other principles will become apparent. As you put the principles together, you will begin to bridge the gap between the prophets and people who lived in the past— they-there-then —and us in our day— I-here-now . (“ Scripture Stories as Patterns for Our Lives ,” Ensign , July 2009, 21) What stands out to you from Elder Jensen’s message? What Old Testament story helped you understand Jesus Christ or His gospel better? The following self-assessment could help students select the part of the identifying truths in scripture stories skill they could practice today. On a scale of 1 to 5, rate your confidence in using the following scripture study skills: I can identify gospel truths in a scripture story. I can easily see how a scripture story teaches about Jesus Christ. I can apply scripture stories to my life. I can effectively share what I learn from scripture stories with others. Today you will study a story in the book of Daniel and explain what you learn from it. You might focus your efforts on the skill you feel the least confident about. Invite the Holy Ghost to help increase your ability to identify truths in scripture stories and to teach others what you learn about Jesus Christ, His life, and His gospel. Daniel cast into the lions’ den Many years after Daniel and his friends were taken captive into Babylon, the nation was conquered by the Medes and the Persians. Darius, a Mede, was made king of Babylon (see Daniel 5:30–31 ). The following activity can help students practice identifying gospel truths in scripture stories by studying the account of Daniel being cast into the lions’ den (see Daniel 6 ). It might be helpful for students to have a brief overview of the story before they search for gospel truths in it. The following are some ways you could summarize the story: You could have students share the story, organizing them into groups to read a section. Each group could then summarize their part of the story for the class. One way to divide the reading would be: Daniel 6:1–5 Daniel 6:6–11 Daniel 6:12–17 Daniel 6:18–23 Daniel 6:24–28 You could summarize the entire story for the class. If available, you could use the images found in the article “ Daniel and the Lions ” (Friend, Nov. 2018, FJ4–FJ6) or the video “ Daniel and the Lions’ Den ” (1:46), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , to help you summarize the story. 1:45 To help students practice identifying gospel principles from scripture stories, use the handout “ Scripture Stories Teach Gospel Truths .” Because students will present what they learn to the class, it might be best to have them work with a partner or in small groups. Consider pairing students who might feel more anxious about presenting with students who might feel more comfortable. Open PDF As students use the handout to prepare their lessons, you might walk around the room to see what gospel truths they are finding. If they are struggling, consider how you could help them learn to identify truths in the account. Examples of truths they might identify are: As disciples of Christ, we will face opposition because of our beliefs ( Daniel 6:1–5 ). The Lord will bless our efforts when we stand up to worldly pressure. ( Daniel 6:6–16 ). As we do what is right and trust the Lord, our righteous example can influence others ( Daniel 6:16–28 ). Share what you have learned After students have completed the handout, invite them to share the lesson they prepared with another group or with the class. If students don’t share parts of the story that remind them of Jesus Christ, you might point out some comparisons such as the following: Daniel and Jesus both did Heavenly Father’s will, even when facing death (see Daniel 6:7, 10 ; John 6:38 ). Daniel and Jesus both miraculously emerged alive from a pit that was covered by a stone (see Daniel 6:17, 23 ; Mark 15:46 ; 16:4–6 ). You could encourage students to take the lessons they prepared home and share them with a family member or friend. To conclude class, consider sharing how you have been blessed by messages of Jesus Christ or His gospel from scripture stories. Invite students to continue to look for impressions from the Holy Ghost to help them see gospel truths in their personal scripture study.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 146 ---\nIn the book of Hosea, the Lord used the marriage of Hosea and Gomer as a symbol to teach Israel about His unfailing covenantal love. Like Israel, at times we might stray from the Lord and our covenants with Him. Even still, Jesus Christ remains faithful and loves us. This lesson can help students understand the Lord’s unfailing love and mercy for them. Student preparation: Invite students to think about what experiences have helped them feel the Lord’s love and mercy Possible Learning Activities Remembering Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ To begin class, prepare students to connect in a relevant way with the story of Hosea and Gomer. One way to do that is through a scenario like the following. Camille and Hannah have been good friends for a year. In that time, they have grown close and supported each other through hard times. Hannah shared some things she is struggling with. Camille promised not to share those things with other people. However, a few days ago, Hannah found out that Camille told some of their other friends about Hannah’s struggles. If you were Hannah, what thoughts and feelings might you have? Why might it be hard to forgive Camille? Consider explaining that this is one example of how we might feel betrayed or hurt when someone breaks a promise. While we might respond to these situations in unhelpful ways, the Lord responds differently. The book of Hosea teaches about a marriage relationship. In the scriptures, the Lord often uses marriage as a symbol for our covenant relationship with Him. President Russell M. Nelson taught that our covenants create “a covenant relationship in which [we and the Lord] are bound to be loyal and faithful to each other” (“ The Everlasting Covenant ,” Liahona , Oct. 2022, 6). Sometimes, God’s children are unfaithful to the Lord and stray from their covenants with Him. As you study the book of Hosea today, look for how the Lord feels about and responds to His covenant people even when they stray from Him. Hosea and Gomer To help students understand the story of Hosea and Gomer, display or summarize the following paragraph. See the Additional Resources section of this lesson in Gospel Library for more information about God’s commandment for Hosea to marry Gomer. Hosea was a prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, prophesying around the same time as Isaiah. The Lord commanded Hosea to marry Gomer, in spite of the fact that she had been an adulteress and a harlot. Hosea and Gomer had three children together (see Hosea 1:2–8 ). You might want to explain that Hosea speaks for the Lord about Gomer, who represents the people of Israel. Consider making two columns on the board. Label one Hosea represents the Lord and the other Gomer represents Israel . Read Hosea 2:5 , looking for what Hosea said Gomer had done. “Their mother” refers to Gomer. How might Gomer’s actions represent the people of Israel? You might explain that Gomer’s unfaithfulness in her covenant marriage with Hosea represented Israel’s spiritual unfaithfulness in their covenant relationship with God. If helpful, students could read 2 Kings 17:14–16 , looking for how Israel had broken their covenants with the Lord. To help students relate the scriptures to themselves, you could ask a question like the following. List student responses on the board underneath Gomer represents Israel . How do people in our time sometimes stray from the Lord and their covenants with Him? Students might share things like being too busy for the Lord, using technology inappropriately, treating others poorly, putting other things before the Lord, or more serious sins. Students could reflect on this list or other things as they ponder the following prompt. Reflect on ways you might be tempted to break your covenants or ways you might be straying from your covenants with the Lord. To help students understand the Lord’s love and mercy for them, you could use the handout “Understanding the Lord’s Love and Mercy.” Students could work on their own to encourage quiet, prayerful pondering, or they could work in groups with an assigned group leader to guide their discussion. As students work, walk around the room and answer students’ questions as needed. Learning about the Lord Invite students to share the statements of truth they wrote on their handouts. They could share out loud or write their statements on the board underneath Hosea represents the Lord . They might write truths like the following: Jesus Christ is full of love and mercy, even when I stray from Him. Jesus Christ invites His covenant people to repent and keep their covenants. As students share, you could ask follow-up questions to help students make clear connections with the scriptures: “What part of the story helped you learn that about Him?” or “How did you see that truth about Him illustrated through Hosea?” Before asking the following question, you might refer students to the list on the board of ways we sometimes stray from the Lord and our covenants with Him. How can what you’re learning about the Lord help youth who feel discouraged or ashamed because they have strayed from the Lord? Before asking the next question, it might be wise to counsel students not to share anything too personal, such as previous sins. You could also share an experience from your own life. In what ways have you seen the Lord demonstrate His love and mercy in your life or the life of someone you know? Demonstrate understanding When students have a chance to explain or reflect on what they have learned, it can invite the Holy Ghost to teach them further. One way for them to do this is the following short writing activity. Choose one of the following. Write a message. Think about someone (it could be yourself) who might feel they have strayed too far from the Lord to be forgiven. Write an encouraging message to this person and share what you have learned about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that you think might help them. Write a description. How would you describe the character of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ based on what you learned or felt today? You might share with students that we, like Gomer, can choose to accept the Lord’s loving invitation to repent and return to Him when we have strayed. Consider ending with your testimony of the Lord.\n\n\n--- Lesson 147 ---\nThis is an exciting time to live on the earth! Many prophecies and promises from the Lord are being fulfilled. Among these is the Lord’s promise “I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh” ( Joel 2:28 ; see also Joseph Smith—History 1:41 ). Think of it—the Creator of the world wants to bless you with His Spirit! This lesson can help students increase their capacity to receive personal revelation from the Lord through the Holy Ghost. Student preparation: Provide students with the question “What can I do to receive more personal revelation in my life?” Invite them to reflect on different ways they could answer. They could also look to the scriptures or teachings of Church leaders or ask people they trust for answers to the question. Possible Learning Activities Our capacity for personal revelation Consider bringing containers of various sizes to class or drawing some on the board. For example, you could bring (or draw on the board) a small cup and pitcher and a large bucket. You could ask students to share which container they would choose for collecting water, money, or other items and explain why they would choose that container. Display the following statement and invite students to discuss the accompanying question with a partner or small group. If needed, explain that capacity can mean the maximum amount something can contain. President Russell M. Nelson gave the following invitation: My beloved brothers and sisters, I plead with you to increase your spiritual capacity to receive revelation. … Choose to do the spiritual work required to enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost and hear the voice of the Spirit more frequently and more clearly.“ Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 96) How could you use the different containers to explain to someone what it means to “increase [our] spiritual capacity to receive revelation?” After discussing President Nelson’s invitation, you could point to the containers and invite students to quietly reflect on their personal spiritual capacity to receive revelation. They could record their responses to the following questions in their study journal. Which container do you feel best represents your current capacity to receive personal revelation? Why? What are you experiencing in your life that could benefit from receiving more personal revelation from God? You might explain that seminary provides opportunities to “do the spiritual work required” to receive personal revelation. Encourage students to put forth effort such as offering a silent prayer, making comments, marking scriptures, or recording thoughts in their study journals. As they engage and participate in these ways, the Holy Ghost can teach them how they might increase their capacity to receive personal revelation. God will pour out His spirit Joel prophesied of terrible events that would precede the second coming of Jesus Christ (see Joel 2:1–11 ). Joel also prophesied of great promises the Lord would fulfill to help His people in the last days. Read Joel 2:21 and the first line in verses 22 and 23 . Mark the counsel the Lord gave to His creations in the last days. What are some “great things” Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have done that can help you “fear not” and “be glad”? Read Joel 2:27–29 , looking for the great things the Lord promised to do in the latter days. What did you see in these verses that could be considered “great”? Students might express many truths, including that the Lord will pour out His Spirit upon all people in the latter days . Consider sharing that the angel Moroni repeated this prophecy when he visited Joseph Smith (see Joseph Smith—History 1:41 ). What are some different ways the Lord might pour out His Spirit? This prophecy can have multiple meanings and fulfillments. One way the Lord pours His spirit upon us is by giving us personal revelation. If you brought containers to class, you could demonstrate the differences between pouring, dripping, and spraying water into a container. Discuss the significance of the Lord’s promise to pour out His spirit upon us. How can we recognize the revelation the Lord is pouring out upon us? If students need help answering the previous question, you could invite half the class to read Galatians 5:22–23 and the other half to read Doctrine and Covenants 11:12–13 then share what they found. Students might also benefit from discussing the significance of the phrase all flesh in Joel 2:28 and further explained in verse 29 . Help them understand that this promise is for all Heavenly Father’s children both women and men. What does this teach you about Heavenly Father’s desires for you? Increasing our capacity To help students learn how to “do the spiritual work” necessary to receive personal revelation, you could give them each a copy of the handout “ Increasing Your Capacity to Receive Revelation .” Consider placing students in groups of three and assigning every student a separate statement to study from the first part of the handout. Students could then share with their group what they learned. They could complete the second step on the handout as a group or individually. Open PDF When students have completed the handout, consider inviting them to choose one or two suggestions they feel would be most helpful for teenagers to receive personal revelation. Invite them to write these suggestions on separate pieces of paper and place them in the largest container you brought to class. You could express that the largest container can symbolize our need to increase our capacity to receive revelation. Consider writing the following instructions on the board. Share one of the following related to the suggestion: A personal experience Some advice A scripture or statement A question You could invite a few students, one at a time, to draw a paper from the container. They could read to the class the suggestion they drew and then choose one thing from the board they would like to share or ask the class to share. Consider the time you have available in class and the engagement level of your students as you determine how many suggestions to discuss. Be sure to leave enough time for students to apply what they have learned. Apply what you have learned To help students see the confidence Church leaders have in youth to receive revelation, consider watching “ 2020 Temple and Family History Leadership Instruction ” from timecode 56:06 to 58:29, available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles speaks to youth presidencies about adjustments made to involve them more in the work of salvation. 59:35 Consider bearing your witness that the Lord wants to pour out His Spirit and speak to all people, including your students. Invite students to reflect on ways they can increase their capacity to receive revelation in their lives. You could do this by providing the following instructions: Reflect again on what you are experiencing in life that could benefit from more personal revelation from God. In your study journal, draw a container with something being poured into it. Label your container with one or two things you will do to increase your capacity to receive the revelation the Lord is pouring out upon you. You might add specific details of how you will try to do these things effectively. You could invite willing students to share what they wrote.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 149 ---\nIn a world with many persuasive voices, it can be difficult to know which voices to trust. Fortunately, our loving Father in Heaven and Savior, Jesus Christ, reveal Their plans to us through Their living prophets. This lesson can help students understand that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ reveal counsel and truth through Their prophets. Possible Learning Activities Responses to prophetic counsel The following activity is designed to help students ponder their attitude toward prophets. It may be helpful to write the following three social media responses on the board. As an alternative to the following activity, you could invite students to imagine that the responses were shared by their friends after listening to the prophet speak at general conference or a youth devotional. You could then skip the accompanying question. Imagine seeing the following as responses to a social media post: “He has no business talking about this. He doesn’t understand.” “He’s out of touch with what’s really happening.” “With everything else I need to do, I don’t see how I could possibly apply this counsel to my very busy life.” Who could these responses be referring to? You could display a picture of the living prophet and invite students to imagine that these comments were responses to something the prophet said. Students could share why someone may have one of the above attitudes. Consider displaying the following questions to help students assess their feelings about following prophetic counsel. Take a moment to reflect on your view of the Lord’s prophet on the earth today. You could consider your answers to the following questions: How do I feel about the prophet’s counsel? Do my feelings change depending on what counsel he gives? What reasons might I give for following prophetic counsel? Are there any ways I struggle to follow prophetic counsel? As we study in the book of Amos today, the Holy Ghost can help you learn more about the importance of God’s words given to us through His prophets. You may want to write down insights or questions you have while you study today. The Lord reveals His plans through His prophets By the time of Amos’s prophetic ministry to the northern kingdom of Israel, many of God’s covenant people had forsaken Him and His prophets and followed the wicked ways of neighboring nations (see Amos 2:6–12 ). The Lord chose Amos to call them to repentance. Amos prophesied the destruction and captivity of King Jeroboam II and His people (see Amos 7:8–9; 11, 17 ). Read Amos 7:10–15 , looking for how Amaziah, the priest of King Jeroboam II, responded to Amos’s prophetic counsel. What did you find? Why do you think the people thought they could not “bear all [Amos’s] words” ( Amos 7:10 ) and wanted him to go prophesy somewhere else (see Amos 7:12 )? Why do you think God’s prophets continue to teach even when some people see them as being unpopular, out of touch, or not needed? If students do not mention it, you can ask what Amos did before being called to be prophet (see Amos 7:14 ) and what the Lord did in verse 15 to call Amos to become a prophet. Explain that, like with Joseph Smith and others, the Lord does not require His prophets to hold high status or accomplishments before He calls them to be prophets. If students need help answering this question, you may want to share the statement from President Nelson in “ Additional Resources ” of this lesson in Gospel Library. A few chapters earlier, the Lord revealed a powerful truth about Himself and His prophets through Amos. Amos 3:7 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Amos 3:7–8 , looking for what the Lord will always do through His prophets. It may be helpful for students to know that other terms for secret include counsel or plan . What can we learn from these verses about the Lord? Students may use different words to identify that the Lord reveals His plans through His prophets . You might share, as an example of this truth, that before Judah and Israel were eventually destroyed because of the wickedness of the people, the Lord revealed what would happen if the people did not repent (see Amos 2:4–6 , 8:11–12 ). As the lesson continues, look for ways to emphasize that the Lord loves us and wants to guide us. What can this truth teach you about why it’s important for you to listen to the prophet regardless of how others respond to his words? Following the Lord’s prophets The following activity is one way to help students deepen their understanding that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ reveal truth through Their prophets. Consider organizing students in small groups and displaying the steps of the activity one at a time. Recall the social media comments at the beginning of the lesson and select one. The following activity can help you prepare to write a response. Reread Amos 3:7 and ponder how it may help the person who made that comment. Also read the following doctrinal mastery passages, looking for how they may help. (Consider linking or cross-referencing these scriptures with Amos 3:7 .) Ezekiel 3:16–17 Doctrine and Covenants 1:37–38 Doctrine and Covenants 21:4–6 Include at least two blessings that can come when you listen to God’s prophet. You can find examples in the scriptures, stories from Church history, or teachings from prophets today. Try to share one example where a prophet’s words made a positive difference in your life. You could share some of the following examples with students, as needed: Through His prophet Noah, the Lord warned the people that if they didn’t repent, they would be destroyed by a flood (see Moses 8:22–30 ; Genesis 7:17–24 ). The prophet Isaiah prophesied about what the Savior would experience through His Atonement (see Isaiah 53:3–5 ). Home-centered and Church-supported church “prepared us … before any hint of a pandemic, enabling us to endure the challenges that have come” (Gary E. Stevenson, “ Highly Favored of the Lord ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 103). My response Using what you have learned and felt today, write a helpful response to one of the negative comments from the beginning of the lesson. Be sure to include at least one scripture and one example, which could be a personal experience. Invite a few willing students to share their responses. Consider sharing what the Holy Ghost has taught you about God’s love and guidance through His prophets. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Amos 3:7 is “The Lord God … revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 150 ---\nWe have all felt hunger. Imagine what it might be like to suffer from spiritual hunger. The Lord taught the Israelites through Amos using this imagery. Amos prophesied that his people would no longer be given His word because they had rejected it. Losing the Lord’s word would lead to a spiritual famine. This lesson can help students increase their confidence that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ can satisfy their spiritual hunger through the Restoration of the gospel. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder how their lives would be different if they didn’t have the scriptures or words of prophets. Students could come to class ready to share what they thought of. Possible Learning Activities Spiritual hunger Consider beginning class by displaying a picture of food or bringing a simple food item and asking the following questions. When is a time you have felt particularly hungry? How might we act when we are hungry? Answers could include feeling irritated, having low energy, or being desperate for any kind of food. Write the phrase Spiritual Hunger on the board. What might people hunger for spiritually and struggle to find? Consider writing student responses on the board. Students might say things like God’s love, purpose in their lives, knowing truth, direction in difficult decisions, etc. Take a moment to write in your study journal ways in which you or someone you know might currently feel spiritual hunger. Encourage students to seek the Holy Ghost today as they consider what they can do to receive the spiritual nourishment Jesus Christ offers. A famine of hearing the words of the Lord The prophet Amos prophesied of spiritual hunger. He revealed the Lord’s words to the people of Israel, but they did not want to hear them (see Amos 2:12 ; 7:11–16 ). If you feel it would be helpful, invite students to read Amos 7:12–13 to understand how the Israelites responded to the Lord’s words through Amos. Read Amos 8:11–12 looking for the consequences of the people rejecting the Lord’s word. If necessary, explain that a famine is an extreme shortage of food. What consequences did you see? If students do not point them out, share truths like the following: When people reject the Lord’s prophets, they lose the blessings of the word of the Lord. Without the word of God, we starve spiritually. Why do you think famine is a good comparison for living without the word of the Lord? In what ways has Amos’s prophecy been fulfilled? If needed, share with students that these verses refer to a period of time known as an apostasy. An apostasy is when individuals or groups of people reject the principles of the gospel and the Lord no longer sends prophets to them. One fulfillment of Amos’s prophecy occurred following the death of Christ’s apostles and is known as the Great Apostasy. The Great Apostasy lasted until the Lord restored His gospel through the prophet Joseph Smith. You may wish to share the video “ Dispensations: The Pattern of Apostasy and Restoration ” (6:52) to illustrate the significance of the Restoration of the gospel. 6:53 Satisfying spiritual hunger In the Lord’s lovingkindness, He made clear to His people through His prophets that He would save His people from the effects of apostasy and bless His people. The Lord prophesied through Amos that He will gather His people again in a future day and He will bless them in many ways (see Amos 9:14–15 ). Read the following verses looking for what else the Lord revealed through His prophets He would do in the final dispensation before His Second Coming: Daniel 2:44–45 Acts 3:19–21 Ephesians 1:3, 10 Doctrine and Covenants 27:13 ; 112:30 ; 128:18 Invite students to share what they learned and ask questions they have about these verses. For additional help, you may want to direct them to “ Restoration of the Gospel ,” in Topics and Questions . What blessings have Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ made available to a spiritually famished world through the Restoration? Students may list priesthood keys and authority, prophets, revelations, scriptures, Church organizations, ordinances, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Think of how you can help students see how these blessings can meet their needs and those of the people they care about. The following is one way you could do this. Invite students to create a scenario of an individual that hungers for one of the topics listed on the board under Spiritual Hunger . You could have students add details so that the scenario feels more relatable. You could share the following about Marta as an example. Students could then work together, individually, or as small groups to respond to the scenario. Scenario: Marta is 15 years old and wants nothing more than to find purpose for her life. She struggles with self-confidence, and she isn’t sure what direction she should take. What could you share that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have done as part of the Restoration of the gospel that could help satisfy Marta’s spiritual hunger? As part of your response, be sure to include scriptures; quotes from Church leaders; and, if possible, your own personal experience. If students struggle to respond, you could have them look through the For the Strength of Youth Guide or some of the doctrinal mastery passages. If students are responding to the scenario with Marta, you could point them to the heading “ Make inspired choices ” section of the For the Strength of Youth Guide or Moses 1:39 : “This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” Students might ponder how knowing that the Lord cares for them and is actively working toward their return to His presence might fill the spiritual hunger for feeling God’s love or feeling purpose in their life. When students have had sufficient time, invite them to share what they prepared. They can also share what they learned from the experience. Personal reflection To conclude, consider inviting students to respond to the following questions in their journal. What have you learned today that increases your confidence that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ can satisfy our spiritual hunger? What is one way you would like to act on what you have learned or felt?\n\n\n--- Lesson 151 ---\nThe Lord extended His arms of mercy toward Jonah and the people of Nineveh, despite the great mistakes they made. As we recognize that this same love and mercy is extended toward us, we too can exclaim that the Lord is “a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness” ( Jonah 4:2 ). This lesson can help students feel the Lord’s love and mercy for them and for others. Student preparation: Invite students to study the story of Jonah with their family or review it on their own and ponder what they feel is its main message. They could also come up with questions or insights from their study. This invitation is an example of helping students connect what they are learning at home with their study in class. This can help students deepen their learning about the scripture and the Savior. For additional training on connecting what students are learning at home with their experience in the classroom see “ Develop and ask questions that help learners connect what they have learned in their personal and family scripture study to the classroom experience ” in Teacher Development Skills . Possible Learning Activities Our perception Consider beginning class by drawing the following scale on the board with the accompanying words on the sides. As you ask students how others might see Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, you could place a few different lines in different places on the scale to represent their responses. Imagine this scale represents how someone could see Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Why may some people see Them as loving, merciful, and kind while others do not? To help students assess how they perceive Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, consider inviting them to reflect on the following. Ponder where on the line you would place your view of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Consider why you chose that place on the line. Now imagine this scale represents how you think about or treat others. What are reasons we might treat some people one way and other people in a completely different way? As you study the story of Jonah, seek the Holy Ghost to help you see the true nature of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Consider how what you learn about Them can affect the way you see, think about, or treat others. The story of Jonah It may be helpful to explain that Jonah lived in Israel during the reign of King Jeroboam II (see 2 Kings 13–15 , especially 14:25 ). The prophets Amos and Hosea also prophesied around this time. You may want to display an image that provides an overview of the Old Testament and invite students to find Jonah. Read Jonah 1:1–3 , looking for the Lord’s instructions to Jonah and how Jonah responded. Consider explaining that Ninevah was a major city of the Assyrians. The Assyrian kings and soldiers were known for their brutality, such as torturing and murdering the people they conquered. You could also explain that Tarshish might be in present-day Spain, indicating that Jonah left Israel and traveled in the opposite direction of Ninevah. You may want to display a map for students and have them locate Nineveh and Tarshish. What does Jonah’s response indicate to you about how he felt about the Lord’s instructions to preach to the people of Nineveh? To help students study Jonah’s account, you could invite them to complete the handout “The Story of Jonah” individually, in pairs, or in small groups. Alternatively, you could provide students with only the scripture passages from the handout and invite them to sketch a simple illustration and write summary of each passage. Open PDF After giving students time to complete the exercise, invite them to ask questions they have or share insights they gained from studying this account. If needed, explain that Jonah 4 shows that although Jonah was grateful the Lord was merciful and forgiving toward him, he resented these attributes when the Lord showed them to the people of Nineveh. The Lord taught Jonah that the people of Nineveh were of great value to Him, much more than a gourd. Consider writing the following incomplete truths on the board. Invite students to complete the truths using what they just learned from the story of Jonah. The Lord is … To become like the Lord, we must … Consider completing the statements on the board with words or phrases the students share, such as: The Lord is merciful, kind, and forgiving. To become like the Lord, we must be merciful, kind, and forgiving as He is . You could invite students to share specific examples from Jonah’s account that illustrate these truths. They could also share why they feel the words or phrases they chose are important for them to know. Why can it be difficult for us at times to love or be merciful toward others? How can learning about the Lord’s mercy and love affect the way we see, think about, or treat others? Becoming as the Lord Students may have identified other truths than those listed above. If they did, consider ways to deepen students’ understanding of the truths they identified. The following activities can help students better understand both above truths and feel the love of the Lord for them and others. You could organize students into pairs and have each student complete one of the activities individually. They could then teach each other what they found. Or partners could complete the same activity and share with each other what they learn. Choose one of the following scenarios: Scenario A. Imagine you have a friend who feels Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are cruel, unmerciful, or unforgiving. Scenario B. Imagine you have a friend who struggles to be merciful, kind, or forgiving toward someone else. Do the following: Find a verse from the story of Jonah that you would share with your friend. (You could also find additional scripture passages that might help.) Think of an experience that may help. For scenario A: consider when the Lord has shown love or mercy toward you or someone you know. For scenario B: consider when the Lord helped you or someone you know show love or mercy toward others. Some examples of additional scriptures that could help include the following: for scenario A: Isaiah 1:18 or Ether 12:27 ; for scenario B: Moroni 7:45–48 or Doctrine and Covenants 64:9–11 . Willing students could then explain to the class which verse or verses they would share with their friend and why. They could also share their experiences. Students’ answers could invite the Holy Ghost to help them feel the Lord’s love for them and for others. If time permits, consider showing a video that demonstrates the Lord’s love and mercy, such as “ Moving On from Past Mistakes ” (3:43), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Invite students to look for how the Lord demonstrated love and mercy toward Rachel after she made a mistake as a teenager. 3:43 What did you learn? To help students see and feel the Lord’s love and mercy for them and for others, consider inviting them to draw something in their study journal that could remind them of the story of Jonah, such as a whale or a large plant. They could then write their answer to one of the questions below, inside, or next to their drawing. Consider answering one of the following questions in your study journal: What did you learn today that helps you feel that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are merciful, kind, and forgiving? What did you experience today that helps you feel Their love for those you may struggle to love or forgive?",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 152 ---\nMany of us wonder if our sincere efforts truly please Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The prophet Micah wondered what he could do to please the Lord. Micah was taught to “do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly” with Him ( Micah 6:8 ). This lesson can help students make a plan to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to think of a few family members or friends, then to think of specific things they would do to please each of those people. They could note how they might do different things for each person. Possible Learning Activities Pleasing different people Before class, you may want to write the following incomplete question on the board. Consider beginning class by inviting students to respond to the question multiple times, filling in the blank with different people each time (mom, dad, teacher, bishop, friend). Students could share in pairs or small groups. Then you could invite a few volunteers to share with the class. If needed as an example, you might share a few of your own answers using different people in your life. If you wanted to please your______________, what would you do? Why might we act differently depending on who we are trying to please? After students share a few responses to the previous questions, write Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in the blank space on the board. Ponder what you feel pleases Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Think about things you currently do that might please Them and things you could do differently. At the end of the lesson, you will be invited to make a plan to follow through on impressions you receive. What can we do to please the Lord? Speaking to the people of Israel and Judah, Micah prophesied the judgments that would come upon them because of their wickedness. Micah pleaded with Israel to remember the great blessings they had received from the Lord and invited them to repent and be gathered to Him (see Micah 2–5 ). Read Micah 6:4 , looking for some of the ways the Lord had shown His love for Israel. Then read Micah 7:7–8, 18–20 , looking for what Micah said the Lord would do for His covenant people. What did you discover? How have Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ done these things for you? You could invite students to answer the previous question in their study journals and then share with a partner or the class what they wrote. After students share, you might point out that when we recognize the great things the Lord has done for us, it is natural to wonder how we can serve and please Him. Explain that the prophet Micah wrestled with the question of what we can do to please the Lord. The reading invitation and question below invite students to identify a truth from Micah’s message. Helping students identify truths from a scripture passage can help make their scripture study more meaningful. Meaningful scripture study is an important element of building faith in and conversion to Jesus Christ. (For additional training on asking questions that help students identify and state converting truths, see “ Focus on truths that lead to conversion and build faith in Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills .) Sometimes people have inaccurate ideas about what they can do to please the Lord. The prophet Micah helps us better understand the Lord’s love. In Micah 6:6–7 , the prophet uses extreme examples to demonstrate how no amount of worldly riches could please the Lord. Read Micah 6:8 , looking for what we can do to please the Lord. How would you summarize what you learned about pleasing the Lord? Students might use their own words to convey the truth that the Lord is pleased when we strive to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. What does the Lord require? At the end of the lesson, you will invite students to make a plan to improve their efforts to please Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in the ways identified in verse 8 . To prepare students to make this plan, consider using the handout “ What Does the Lord Require? ” After students study one or more sections of the handout with a group, you might invite them to create a three-column chart on the board labeled Do Justly , Love Mercy , and Walk Humbly . After studying the handout, students could write ways a teenager could please the Lord on small pieces of paper and tape them to the board under the corresponding column. At the end of the activity, students could read all the papers. This might help them select something they feel impressed to work on. Open PDF Showing gratitude to the Lord After students have reviewed their classmates’ suggestions, display the following instructions and prompts. Today the Holy Ghost might have inspired a thought to your mind or feeling to your heart about something that could help you do justly, love mercy, or walk humbly with the Lord. Make a plan to act on what you have learned and felt by completing the following prompts in your study journal. To better please Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, I would like to focus on the phrase “ ” from Micah 6:8 . One or two specific things I would like to do are: . You could reassure students that Heavenly Father loves our sincere efforts to please Him. These efforts help us become more like Jesus Christ every day. You might share your witness that as we continually try to do better and be better, the Savior will magnify our sincere efforts.\n\n\n--- Lesson 153 ---\nWhen the prophet Habakkuk had questions about the wickedness around him, he sought and waited for answers from the Lord. Like Habakkuk, we can turn to the Lord with our questions. This lesson can help students understand how to maintain their faith in Jesus Christ when they have questions that seem to go unanswered. Student preparation: Invite students to ask a friend or family member if they have ever struggled with difficult questions that seemed to go unanswered. If so, students can ask what this person did to remain faithful to the Lord as they waited for answers. Possible Learning Activities Having questions is natural Hold up a jar labeled with a question mark in one hand and another jar labeled with a picture of Christ in the other hand. Explain that one jar represents questions or concerns we might have and the other jar represents our faith in the Lord and His gospel. Invite students to think about the following question before reading the statement from President Uchtdorf. Is it possible to struggle with difficult questions and have faith in Jesus Christ and His restored Church at the same time? President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, taught: 44:24 Inquiry is the birthplace of testimony. Some might feel embarrassed or unworthy because they have searching questions regarding the gospel, but they needn’t feel that way. Asking questions isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s a precursor of growth. God commands us to seek answers to our questions and asks only that we seek “with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ” [ Moroni 10:4 ]. When we do so, the truth of all things can be manifested to us “by the power of the Holy Ghost” [ Moroni 10:5 ]. Fear not; ask questions. Be curious, but doubt not! Always hold fast to faith and to the light you have already received. (“The Reflection in the Water” [Church Educational System fireside for young adults, Nov. 1, 2009], broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ) Why do you think youth need to understand what President Uchtdorf taught? Difficult questions The Lord called Habakkuk to be a prophet to the kingdom of Judah before the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem. Like other prophets, Habakkuk had questions and sought understanding from the Lord (see Jeremiah 12:1 ; Doctrine and Covenants 121:1–6 ). Read Habakkuk 1:2–4 , looking for questions Habakkuk struggled with. In your study journal, describe how someone today might express similar questions or concerns. Invite students to share what they wrote. They might share things such as the following: Lord, are you hearing me? ( verse 2 ) Why is there so much violence and sin all around me? ( verse 3 ) Why do bad people get away with so much evil? ( verse 4 ) Give each student a small piece of paper to write down their answers to the following prompt. Like Habakkuk, we too might have questions. Write down a difficult question you might have that you feel hasn’t been answered yet. Students could put what they wrote in the jar representing our questions. Hold up the jar of questions and set down the jar representing our faith in Jesus Christ. Explain that when we have questions, we might be tempted to set aside our faith in Jesus Christ because we don’t have answers. What is the danger of setting aside our faith and relationship with the Lord when we have questions? Hold both jars in your hands and explain that we don’t have to set aside our faith in Jesus Christ because of questions. We can move forward with trust in the Lord as we look for answers. As you study Habakkuk, pay attention to impressions from the Holy Ghost that might help you move forward with faith in the Lord as you wait for answers. Looking to God Throughout the rest of the lesson, you might consider periodically inviting students to add things to the jar of faith. If you do this, give students several small pieces of paper to write what they learn from Habakkuk or their classmates about why or how to trust the Lord. In response to Habakkuk’s questions about the wickedness in his society, the Lord said that He would “raise up the Chaldeans” (Babylonians) to punish the children of Israel (see Habakkuk 1:6 ). Habakkuk wondered why the Lord would allow the wicked Babylonians to conquer his people (see Habakkuk 1:12–17 ). Read Habakkuk 2:1–4 , looking for what Habakkuk chose to do as he struggled with his questions and how the Lord responded. What did you find? You might ask follow-up questions like “What do you think it looks like to ‘watch to see what [God] will say’? (see Habakkuk 2:1 )” or “What does it look like to ‘live by [our] faith’? (see Habakkuk 2:4 ).” You might invite students to add something they are learning to the jar of faith. Explain that the Lord told Habakkuk that the Babylonians would eventually be punished for their wickedness (see Habakkuk 2:5–20 ). Read Habakkuk 3:17–19 , looking for how Habakkuk chose to live by his faith in the Lord. If students need help understanding Habakkuk 3:17–18 , you could explain that in verse 17 , Habakkuk described several undesirable outcomes (plants not providing fruit, fields not providing crops, and so on). In verse 18 , he said that he would “rejoice in the Lord” regardless of the outcome. You could also explain that “hinds’ feet” in Habakkuk 3:19 refers to deer feet, which enable deer to climb difficult ground. This image suggests that the Lord will give us the ability to climb our metaphorical mountains. How do Habakkuk’s attitudes and actions show his faith in God? Help students see from Habakkuk’s example that we can choose to remain faithful to the Lord while waiting for answers to our sincere questions. What do you know about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that helps you trust Them while waiting for answers? As students share what they know, you might ask follow-up questions like “How did you come to know that about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?” You might invite students to add what they are learning from Habakkuk or their classmates to the jar of faith. How to move forward Help students think about how to move forward with faith in God even though they might have questions. To do so, students could watch “ His Grace: Choosing to Believe in God ” (4:07), looking for what Adam did to remain faithful to God despite difficult questions and concerns. 4:7 Students could also read 1 Nephi 10:17–22 ; 11:1 or Mosiah 24:9–17 , or explore one of the sections in “ Seeking Answers to Questions ” in Topics and Questions (Gospel Library). What are you learning that could help a young person choose to remain faithful to God as they wait for answers? Students could share experiences of when they or someone they know chose to faithfully trust God while waiting for answers. You could also share your own experience or testify of why you trust Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Encourage students to write down what they have learned today that will help them trust the Lord as they wait for answers. Students could add these ideas to the jar of faith. If time permits, you could read some of the papers from the jar of faith. As you read, you might ask students to share additional thoughts or impressions that come to them. Consider keeping these jars to refer to in future lessons. For example, you might use what students have added to the jar of faith to enhance a doctrinal mastery practice lesson.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 155 ---\nIn our busy lives, how can we make time for the Lord and the things He asks us to do? We can benefit from following the Lord’s invitation to the Jews to “consider [our] ways” ( Haggai 1:5 ) regarding how we make time for Him. This lesson can help students put God first in their lives. Student preparation: Invite students to make a list of things they do on a typical day. Students could label which things they feel are most important and ponder why they consider those things important. They could bring their lists to class. Possible Learning Activities Prioritizing the Lord The following object lesson is in the article “ Making Good Use of Your Time ” ( New Era , July 2020, 34–35). Before class, fill a jar with rocks, then add sand to the top, shaking it to settle. This is to ensure you have enough sand to fill the jar. Then, separate the sand and rocks again. Bring the jar, sand, and rocks to class. As class begins, show the items to students, explaining that the jar represents our time, the rocks our priorities, and the sand our daily activities. What are things you spend your time doing each day? What are things the Lord asks each of us to prioritize? Students might respond to the second question with answers such as scripture study, prayer, family time, service, and so on. Consider writing students’ answers on the rocks. To help students see the value of prioritizing, first fill the jar with sand. Then try adding the rocks, which won’t fit. Discuss how to fit both. Empty the jar and try again. Add the rocks first, then the sand, shaking the jar to settle in the gaps. What can we learn from this object lesson? Why can it be difficult to make time for the Lord and the things He asks us to do each day? As you study Haggai, look for inspiration from the Holy Ghost about how the Lord can bless your life as you make time for Him. Rebuilding the temple To help your students understand the context of Haggai, consider sharing the following summary. After the Jews returned to Jerusalem from their captivity in Babylon, they put great effort into rebuilding their temple, city, homes, and lives (see Ezra 1:1–6 ). But after about 15 years had passed, the Lord was displeased that they had not given higher priority to rebuilding the temple (see Ezra 4:24 ; Haggai 1:3–4 ). He sent His prophet Haggai to persuade the people to prioritize building the Lord’s house. Read Haggai 1:2–4 , looking for words or phrases that show that the Jews were not focused on rebuilding the temple. You might need to explain that “ceiled” means paneled. This might indicate that while they left the temple unfinished, the people built comfortable and well-furnished houses for themselves. How might this relate to the object lesson? Read Haggai 1:5–11 , looking for consequences the Jews faced because they prioritized other things instead of rebuilding the temple. What are some consequences we might experience if we don’t prioritize the Lord in our lives? You could invite students to point out or mark the repeated phrase in verses 5 and 7 . What do you think the Lord meant when He invited the people to “consider [their] ways”? ( Haggai 1:5, 7 ) “From this day will I bless you” Consider reading or summarizing the following paragraph to help students understand the remainder of the account. The Jews and their leaders obeyed the voice of the Lord. Zerubbabel (the governor) and Joshua (the high priest) led the efforts to rebuild the temple (see Haggai 1:12–14 ). The prophet Haggai helped too (see Ezra 5:1–2 ). As they worked, the Lord offered words of encouragement. Write the following incomplete truth on the board: If we put God first in our lives … Consider dividing the class into three sections, with each section reading one of the following passages. Read one or more of the following passages, looking for encouragement from the Lord that can complete the sentence on the board: Haggai 2:4–5 Haggai 2:6–9 Haggai 2:18–19 Students could come to the board and write how they would complete the statement. The following are examples of what they might write: … He will be with us. … He will give us peace. … He will bless us spiritually and temporally. To find additional blessings that we can receive by putting God first, students could read Mosiah 2:41 and 3 Nephi 13:31–33 . You could then add what they find to the board. Which of the Lord’s blessings from these verses do you want most? Why? Help students recognize ways they can put God first to invite His blessings. If you did not show the video “ The Soul’s Sincere Desire ” (3:28) when you taught Lesson 93: “ Nehemiah ,” then consider showing it here from time code 0:00 to 2:01. This video is available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . You could invite students to look for ways they could respond to the questions below. 3:29 Alternatively, you could share the following scenario. Students can then answer the accompanying questions in pairs, small groups, or as a class. Imagine you have a friend named Alex who feels she does not have any time to prioritize God in her life. Her days are filled with schoolwork, friends, and hobbies, leaving her exhausted and unmotivated for spiritual things. She sees a need to change but doesn’t know what to do. What advice would you give Alex to help her put God first? How might God bless her for putting Him first? After enough time, you could show the rest of “ The Soul’s Sincere Desire ” from time code 2:02 to 3:28, inviting students to look for what Alex does to change. 3:29 What other advice would you give someone who feels they cannot put God first in their life for any other reason? How has God blessed you or others you know from putting Him first? Make a plan This section can help students apply what they learned. Consider displaying the following statement. Personally reflect on the following invitation from Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: 13:57 I repeat the admonition of the Lord to His people delivered through the Old Testament prophet Haggai: “Now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways” [ Haggai 1:5 ]. Each of us should evaluate our temporal and spiritual priorities sincerely and prayerfully to identify the things in our lives that may impede the bounteous blessings that Heavenly Father and the Savior are willing to bestow upon us. And surely the Holy Ghost will help us to see ourselves as we really are. (“ Put On Thy Strength, O Zion ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 94) Act on the Lord’s invitation to “consider your ways” ( Haggai 1:5, 7 ) by pondering your own priorities. Ponder if there are things you need to prioritize or remove from your life to invite blessings Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are willing to give you. In your journal, sketch a jar with rocks, and label the rocks with commitments you will make to prioritize God. Draw sand outside the jar, and label it with things you’d like to eliminate. Choose a rock or two and plan what, when, and how you will fulfill these commitments. Consider sharing your testimony or thoughts about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ’s blessings as we put Them first in our lives.\n\n\n--- Lesson 156 ---\nAfter 50 years of captivity in Babylon and Persia, a remnant of the house of Israel had physically returned to their holy land, but spiritually they were still far from the Lord. Through the prophet Zechariah, the Savior renewed His invitation, “turn ye unto me” ( Zechariah 1:3 ), with the promise that He would “dwell in the midst of [His people]” ( Zechariah 2:10 ). This lesson can help students understand ways they can turn to the Lord. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder what they would say to a friend who feels far away from the Lord’s love. Students could prepare to share their advice with the class. Students might ask a trusted friend or parent what counsel they would give in this situation. Possible Learning Activities Why do some people turn away from Jesus Christ? Consider beginning class by displaying an image of the Savior next to a stick figure with an arrow pointing away from him. What are some reasons teenagers might turn away from the Lord? Remind students that throughout the Old Testament, prophets declared the Savior’s invitation to turn or return to Him regardless of the reason they turned away (see Deuteronomy 4:30–31 ; Nehemiah 1:9 ). Sometimes we turn away without recognizing that we are drifting. Invite students to think about if they or people they love might be turning away from the Lord. You could invite students to reflect on the following self-assessment. Which of the following statements do you feel is true of you? I want to help people I care about who are turning away from the Lord. I haven’t really thought about how close I am to the Lord. I am feeling tempted to turn away from the Lord. I am doing my best to stay close to the Lord and hope I can stay strong. As you study Zechariah, seek inspiration from the Holy Ghost to help you in your personal circumstances. Turning to the Lord After 50 years of captivity, many Israelites finally returned to Jerusalem and the surrounding area. They rebuilt the city and started rebuilding the Lord’s temple (see Ezra 5:1–2 ; 6:14 ). But though they had physically returned to Jerusalem, many people were still far from the Lord spiritually. He sent the prophet Zechariah to help the people turn to Him so that He could “dwell in the midst of [them]” ( Zechariah 2:10 ). Read Zechariah 1:1–3 , looking for what the Lord invited His people to do. Create four columns on the board. Write or have a student write the following incomplete truth on the board above the columns: We turn to the Lord by … You could write the following scripture passages on the board, one in each column. Organize students into groups of four and invite each group member to study one of the passages. Students could then complete the statement of truth using their passage. Zechariah 1:4 Zechariah 3:7 (“I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by” can refer to feeling clean and worthy in the presence of heavenly messengers; see footnote c .) Zechariah 7:9–10 Zechariah 8:16–17 (note the phrase “peace in your gates”) Students might share different wordings, but help them complete the bolded truth with statements like: … turning away from evil ( Zechariah 1:4 ). … walking in the Lord’s ways ( Zechariah 3:7 ). … treating others with mercy and compassion ( Zechariah 7:9–10 ). … acting as peacemakers ( Zechariah 8:16–17 ). Consider writing each phrase on the board in the proper columns. The following activity can help deepen students’ understanding of the truths they identified from Zechariah. Give each group copies of the handout “ We Can Turn to the Lord By … ” Invite students to work in pairs or small groups to complete the handout. Alternatively, you could assign different scenarios to different pairs and have them prepare to share with pairs that worked on a different scenario. Open PDF Share what you have learned Invite the groups to share what they learned. One way to do this is to invite each group to write their responses to prompt 2 or 3 for one of the scenarios in the appropriate column on the board. When students finish sharing, help them reflect on what they have learned by inviting them to do the following. In your study journal, write down one or two things you feel could help you turn to the Lord. Prayerfully invite your Heavenly Father to help you with your efforts. You might conclude with your witness of the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for us and Their constant loving invitation to turn to Them.\n\n\n--- Lesson 157 ---\nThrough His prophets, the Lord reveals details about future events so we can recognize and look forward to them with confidence. Zechariah prophesied that the Savior will return and protect His people from the nations gathered to fight against them. This lesson can help students feel confident that the Savior will be with them during the events preceding the Second Coming. Student preparation: Invite students to read “ Second Coming of Jesus Christ ” in Topics and Questions (Gospel Library). Encourage them to come to class prepared to share what they learned or what questions they have. Possible Learning Activities Anticipating the Savior’s Second Coming Consider starting class by asking students to think about some big events they anticipate in the future, like going on a vacation, serving a mission, or getting married. Invite them to share how they feel about these events. Then show an image of the Savior’s Second Coming. Invite students to list several words on the board that could represent how individuals might feel about this event. The list might include words like excited , ready , confident , peaceful , scared , uncertain , nervous , or unsure . To assess how they feel about the Savior’s Second Coming, students could do the following. In your study journal, answer the following questions: Which words describe how you feel about the Savior’s Second Coming? What influences how you feel about this event? Write down any questions you have about the Savior’s Second Coming. As you study events related to the Second Coming, listen for impressions from the Spirit to know how you can feel more confident that the Savior will be with you during these events. You might invite students to share what they wrote. Encourage students to look for answers to their questions as they study Zechariah. Note: You do not need to answer every question about the Savior’s Second Coming. If students want to learn more, they can study resources like “ Second Coming of Jesus Christ ” in Topics and Questions (Gospel Library). Zechariah prophesied the Savior’s Second Coming To help students understand Zechariah’s prophecies about the Savior’s Second Coming, you could read or summarize the following paragraph. Students could also read the chapter headings for Zechariah 10 ; 12–14 . Zechariah prophesied that in the last days, a great battle, known as the battle of Armageddon (see Revelation 16:16 ), will take place near Jerusalem. All the nations of the earth will gather against Jerusalem (see Zechariah 12:2–3 ). As part of the battle, Jerusalem will be under siege as armies encompass the city (see Zechariah 14:2 ). The Savior will then appear on the Mount of Olives (see Zechariah 14:4 ). To help students learn more about how the Savior will help His people during these events, consider using the handout “ What Will the Savior Do For … ” You could read the verses as a class and invite students to write below each question the words or phrases that describe what the Savior promised to do for the faithful. Alternatively, you could organize the class into three groups and assign each group a question to study and share with the class. If students have questions about what will happen to the wicked at the Savior’s Second Coming, you could invite them to read Zechariah 14:12–13, 17–19 . These verses describe conditions for people who choose not to follow Jesus Christ. Open PDF After students complete the handout, invite them to ask questions about what they studied. If you are uncertain about an answer, tell them you don’t know. Invite them to search for an answer. You could also search for an answer with them in or out of class. The following question can help students identify truths from Zechariah’s teachings. What do these passages teach you about Jesus Christ? As part of the discussion, invite students to summarize what they learned about the Savior in a simple statement of truth. Students might share a variety of answers, including Jesus Christ will return in the last days and gather, save, and protect His people. Power comes when students recognize that the truths they are learning from the scriptures are evidence of the love, power, and mercy of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ in their lives. This realization can help students feel a closer connection to Them. The following questions can help students reach this understanding. (For additional training on asking questions that connect the Lord’s love, power, and mercy to the truths being taught in the scriptures, see “ Help learners recognize the Lord’s love, power, and mercy in their lives ” in Teacher Development Skills .) How can knowing this truth about Jesus Christ help us face His Second Coming with confidence? What are some ways Jesus Christ gathers, saves, and protects His people today? Answers to the previous question could include: Jesus Christ gathers by inviting all to come to Him, follow His gospel, and receive the blessings of the temple. He saves by offering the gift of His Atonement and the ordinances of the gospel. He protects by revealing His will through living prophets and scriptures. Show what you know The following activity can help students express their confidence in what the Savior promised to do for His people when He comes again. Students could work individually or in groups. Invite them to use the scripture verses from the handout to complete the activity. To prepare students to write their own lyrics, you could show the video “ Come, O Thou King of Kings ” (3:43) on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 3:44 Read the lyrics to the hymn “ Come, O Thou King of Kings ” ( Hymns , no. 59). Then write an additional verse to the hymn. Include Zechariah’s teachings about what the Savior promised to do for His people during His Second Coming, and how these promises help you feel confident that the Savior will be with His people in the last days. Invite students to share the lyrics they wrote. You might consider singing the hymn together as a class, including one or more of the verses students wrote. To conclude, you could share your testimony of the Savior and how He helps you look forward to His Second Coming with confidence.",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 158 ---\nSince ancient times, Heavenly Father has blessed His children for their willingness to obey His law of tithing. The Lord’s words through the prophet Malachi help us learn how He will bless us because of our obedience to His law. This lesson can help students feel a desire to obey the Lord’s law of tithing. Student preparation: Invite students to prepare to share a story where someone was blessed by obeying the Lord’s commandment to pay tithing. If helpful, students could ask their parents or Church leaders or look for stories in Gospel Library. Possible Learning Activities Paying tithing To begin the lesson, you might want to share part of a story that illustrates circumstances when it might be difficult to pay tithing. You could share Elder Cordón’s experience or one of your own. If needed, explain that tithing is donating “one-tenth of our income to the Church” ( Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ [2023], 85 ; see also Doctrine and Covenants 119:3–4 ). Read the following experience from Elder Valeri V. Cordón of the Seventy, looking for why it might have been difficult for his parents to obey the Lord’s law of tithing. 12:28 After some events related to a civil war in Central America, my father’s business went bankrupt. He went from about 200 full-time employees to fewer than five sewing operators who worked as needed in the garage of our home. One day during those difficult times, I heard my parents discussing whether they should pay tithing or buy food for the children. (“ The Language of the Gospel ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2017, 56) What are other circumstances we might face where paying tithing could be challenging? The following graphic could help students organize their thoughts throughout this lesson. Invite students to draw the graphic, or something similar, on a blank page in their study journals. You might also draw something similar on the board. Point to the “My Feelings” circle. Inform students that at the end of the lesson, they will have an opportunity to write how they feel about tithing. They might want to ponder now about any concerns or challenges they face to paying tithing. They could also ponder how they could benefit from identifying blessings the Lord has promised to people who pay tithing. As you study the Lord’s law of tithing, the Holy Ghost can help you understand the blessings available to you and strengthen your desire to follow this law. Pouring out blessings To help students understand the context of Malachi 3 , share in your own words the following summary of Malachi 1–2 . Although the people in Malachi’s day continued to offer sacrifices to the Lord, they dishonored Him by offering “polluted bread” and blind, lame, and sick animals (see Malachi 1:7–8, 13 ) as sacrifices that were supposed to symbolize Jesus Christ. The Lord rebuked the priests, who had “departed out of the [Lord’s] way” and “caused many to stumble” ( Malachi 2:8 ) because of their bad examples. In Malachi 3 , the Lord taught one way we can make a willing sacrifice to Him. Malachi 3:8–10 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Malachi 3:7–12 , looking for the Lord’s promised blessings for people who offer Him their tithing. Write the blessings you find around “The Lord’s Blessings” on your graphic. It might help for students to know that the phrase “prove me now herewith” could mean that the Lord is saying, “Test Me in this.” What truths do you learn about tithing from the Lord’s words in Malachi 3:7–12 ? Allow students to share truths they identified. Invite students to write a truth like As we obey the Lord’s law of tithing, He will generously bless us as a note in their scriptures next to these verses. To help students understand this truth, consider bringing a pan, a cup, and pitcher of water to class. Place the cup in the pan. Explain that the water represents the blessings the Lord will give us as we pay tithing. Invite a student to pour the water from the pitcher into the cup until the water overflows into the pan. Relate this to what the Lord promised in Malachi 3:10 . The Lord’s law of tithing The accompanying handout, “ The Lord’s Law of Tithing ,” can deepen students’ understanding of the blessings the Lord provides us as we obey His law. Consider organizing students into small groups and providing each group with a copy of the handout. Students can take turns reading the quotes out loud. After reading each quote, students could add more blessings to the graphics in their study journals. Open PDF After groups have added blessings to their graphics, students could ponder how they have seen the Lord bless them or others for obeying His law of tithing. Students could then share some blessings they or others have experienced by obeying this law. Consider watching “ The Language of the Gospel ,” available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org , from time code 6:42 to 7:40. In this video, students can hear the remainder of Elder Cordón’s experience from the beginning of class. 12:28 What can we learn about Heavenly Father as He blesses us for paying tithing? After discussing the blessings of paying tithing, you might want to point out that some people who pay tithing might not receive the blessings they hope for and might still struggle financially. They might wonder why they should continue to pay their tithing. You could read Malachi 3:14, 16–17 , looking for what the Lord promised people who continue faithfully in their obedience to Him. Obeying the Lord’s law of tithing Next to “My Feelings” on your graphic, write about: How you feel about obeying the Lord’s law of tithing. Anything you studied or felt today that increases your desire to pay tithing. This could include promised blessings from the Lord you want to receive. Invite a few willing students to share their feelings about the Lord and His law of tithing. You might also share blessings you have received by obeying this law. Memorize You might want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Malachi 3:8–10 is “The blessings of paying tithing.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 159 ---\nIn sacred temples, the Savior unites families for eternity through sealing keys. Malachi prophesied that the Savior would restore these keys to “turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers” ( Malachi 4:6 ). This lesson can help students turn their hearts to their parents, ancestors, and future posterity. Student preparation: Invite students to spend a few minutes exploring FamilySearch.org or the FamilySearch Tree app. For example, they could click on relatives in their family tree to learn more about them. Or they could complete some of the family history activities found on the website or in the “More” menu on the app. If students don’t have access to these resources, they could talk to a parent or family member to learn something new about an ancestor. Possible Learning Activities Roots and branches Consider inviting students to draw a tree with roots and branches in their study journals. You could also draw one on the board. Why are both roots and branches essential for the health of a tree? Invite students to write their name on the trunk of the tree they have drawn. If the trunk of a tree represents you, whom could the roots and branches represent? If needed, explain that in the scriptures, the Lord often uses the metaphor of a tree with roots and branches to teach about family. You could also watch “ By the Hand of Elijah the Prophet ” (3:32) from time code 0:00 to 0:35, available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 3:32 Invite students to label the roots ancestors and the branches posterity . Provide the following instructions: Next to the roots in your drawing, write a brief description of how you feel about your ancestors (parents, grandparents, and so on). Next to the branches in your drawing, write what you hope for your potential posterity or what you envision as you think about them (children, grandchildren, and so on). As you study Malachi 4 , consider what the Savior has done to strengthen and preserve the roots and branches of your family tree. You might offer a silent prayer, asking Heavenly Father to help you understand what you can do to strengthen your eternal family. Because students come from various home situations, it is important to talk about the doctrine of eternal families with sensitivity and understanding. Remind students that the Savior is fully aware of their circumstances and can provide needed hope and healing for their past, present, and future families through His Atonement. Malachi’s prophecies Read Malachi 4:1 , looking for what the Lord taught about roots and branches in this prophecy of His Second Coming. Based on what you have learned about roots and branches, what do you think the Savior is teaching? Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained the following: Without the sealings that create eternal families and link generations here and hereafter, we would be left in eternity with neither roots nor branches—that is, neither ancestry nor posterity. (“ The Sealing Power ,” Liahona , Nov. 2023, 21) Ponder how you would feel if you could not be sealed, or united forever, with a family that you love. Malachi 4:5–6 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Read Malachi 4:5–6 , looking for what the Savior promised to do so that families could be sealed together. Footnotes might help as you read. What do you understand about this prophecy? What questions do you have? If students need help understanding this prophecy, consider inviting them to link or cross-reference Malachi 4:5–6 to Doctrine and Covenants 110:13–16 ; 138:47–48 . Students could read these passages, looking for additional insights about Malachi’s prophecy. Help students identify that the Savior sent Elijah to restore the sealing keys and turn families’ hearts to each other . This promise was fulfilled on April 3, 1836, when Elijah appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple. The sealing keys he restored make sacred ordinances valid on earth and in heaven. This includes ordinances performed in holy temples. Consider displaying a picture of a temple and the following statement. Read the following statement from Elder Christofferson, looking for how the Savior blesses us with His sealing power in holy temples: [In the Lord’s temple] we see the majesty and sacredness of the sealing power—it makes individual salvation and family exaltation universally available to the children of God wherever and whenever they may have lived on the earth.
