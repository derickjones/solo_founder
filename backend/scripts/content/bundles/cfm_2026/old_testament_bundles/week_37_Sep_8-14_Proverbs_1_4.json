Its main message is that if you seek wisdom—especially God’s wisdom—life will go well. But Proverbs is followed by the book of Ecclesiastes, which seems to say, “It’s not that simple.” The Preacher quoted in Ecclesiastes observed that he “gave [his] heart to know wisdom” but still found “vexation of spirit” and “much grief” (\nEcclesiastes 1:17–18\n). In various ways, the book asks, “Can there be real meaning in a world where everything seems vain, temporary, and uncertain?”\nAnd yet, while the two books look at life from different perspectives, they teach similar truths. Ecclesiastes declares: “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man” (\nEcclesiastes 12:13\n). This is the same principle found throughout Proverbs: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart” (\nProverbs 3:5\n; see also\nverse 7\n). Life is always better—if not always perfect—when we trust and follow the Lord Jesus Christ.\nFor an overview of these books, see “\nProverbs, book of\n” and “\nEcclesiastes\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nProverbs 1–4\n;\n15–16\n;\nEcclesiastes 1–3\n;\n11–12\n“Incline thine ear unto wisdom.”\nThe books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are filled with insights about wisdom. Consider marking the word “wisdom” and related words, like “knowledge” and “understanding,” as you find them in\nProverbs 1–4\n;\n15–16\n;\nEcclesiastes 1–3\n;\n11–12\n. How do these chapters affect the way you think about wisdom? Based on what you find, how would you describe the wisdom that “the Lord giveth”? (\nProverbs 2:6\n). What blessings come from God’s wisdom?\nSee also\nMatthew 7:24–27\n;\n25:1–13\n.\nHelp learners share what they’re learning.\n“Give learners opportunities to share with each other what they are learning about the Savior and His gospel. Doing this will help them internalize the truths they are taught and express them. It will also help them gain confidence in their ability to share truths in other settings” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n26\n). For example, you could invite learners to write down some references from Proverbs or Ecclesiastes where they found insights about God’s wisdom. Then invite learners to talk about what they learned.\nProverbs 1:7\n;\n2:5\n;\n3:7\n;\n15:33\n;\n16:6\n;\n31:30\n;\nEcclesiastes 12:13\n“Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord.”\nAnother theme found throughout Proverbs and Ecclesiastes is “the fear of the Lord.” Watch for this phrase as you read. What do you feel it means to fear the Lord? Look for insights in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “\nTherefore They Hushed Their Fears\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 46–49). How is fear of the Lord different from other kinds of fear?\nSee also\nProverbs 8:13\n.\nProverbs 3:5–7\n;\n4\n“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart.”\nHow would you try to persuade someone that it’s better to “trust in the Lord” than to “lean … unto [our] own understanding”? (\nProverbs 3:5\n). What comparisons or object lessons would you use? As you ponder\nProverbs 3:5–7\n, think of ways you might complete sentences like these:\nTrusting the Lord is like … Leaning on our own understanding is like …\nWhy is it unwise to lean on our own understanding? How have you discovered that the Lord is trustworthy?\nEven so, we might find it difficult to trust the Lord at times. Why is that? Elder Gerrit W. Gong suggests some reasons, along with helpful counsel, in “\nTrust Again\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 97–99). What stories or teachings do you find in this message that might help someone restore their trust in the Lord?\nBoth\nProverbs 3:6\nand\nProverbs 4\ncompare life to a “path” or a “way.” What do you think it means to let the Lord “direct [your] paths”? (\nProverbs 3:6\n). What do you find in\nchapter 4\nthat helps you “ponder the path of [your] feet”? (\nverse 26\n). For example, what do\nverses 11–12\nand\n18–19\nteach about the blessings of following the right path? What do\nverses 26–27\nmean to you?\nSee also\n2 Nephi 31:18–21\n; “\nLord, I Would Follow Thee\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 220.\nProverbs 15\n;\n16:24–32\n“A soft answer turneth away wrath.”\nSome of the ideas in\nProverbs 15–16\nmight inspire you to improve the way you communicate with others, especially loved ones. For example, think about specific times when “a soft answer” helped to “[turn] away wrath” (\nProverbs 15:1\n).\nYou might also think of times when the Savior exemplified the teachings in\nProverbs 15:1–4, 18\n(see\nMark 12:13–17\n;\nJohn 8:1–11\n). How can you follow His example as you interact with others?\nHow might the counsel in\nProverbs 15\n;\n16:24–32\napply to today’s digital communication?

How does this affect the way we think about these verses? How do we show that we fear the Lord?\nProverbs 3:5–7\nI can trust in the Lord with all my heart.\nYou and your children could make up actions to go with\nProverbs 3:5–7\n, like making a heart with your hands, leaning to one side, walking in place, and pointing to your eyes. How can we show that we trust Jesus Christ with all our hearts?\nTo show what it means to “lean not unto thine own understanding” (\nProverbs 3:5\n), consider inviting your children to lean against something sturdy and stable, like a wall. Then they could try leaning against something that is not sturdy, like a broom. Or they could try leaning a stick or a pencil against objects of varying sturdiness, such as a book or a piece of paper. Why is it important to “trust in the Lord” (\nverse 5\n) and not our “own understanding”?\nLearning to Trust the Lord\n, by Kathleen Peterson\nProverbs 15:1, 18\nI can use kind words.\nPerhaps you and your children can think of situations when you or they might feel angry. Read\nProverbs 15:1\ntogether, and help your children apply this verse to the situations they thought of. Maybe they could practice some “soft answers.” A song about kindness, such as “\nLove Is Spoken Here\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 190–91), could reinforce this principle.\nTo learn what it means to be “slow to anger” (\nProverbs 15:18\n), you and your children could share times when you (or someone you know) felt angry but chose to be kind. Help your children think of things we can be\nquick to\nif we are “slow to anger.” For example, we can be quick to think about Jesus, to ask Heavenly Father for help, to think of a Primary song, or, if possible, to walk away.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n\n\n--- SEMINARY_TEACHER: Seminary Teacher Week 37: Lesson 111: Lesson 111—EcclesiastesThis lesson can help students understand how focusing on meeting God at the Final Judgment can help them make wise choices. ---\n\n--- Lesson 111 ---\nSometimes it can be easy to focus on what happens in this life while forgetting to view our lives from an eternal perspective. In Ecclesiastes, the Preacher reminds us that the things of this world are temporary. He counsels us to prepare for when God will judge all of His children. This lesson can help students understand how focusing on meeting God at the Final Judgment can help them make wise choices. Student preparation: Invite students to have a conversation with a parent or trusted leader about how they have seen the long-term impact of the decisions they made as a teenager. Possible Learning Activities Making decisions Consider beginning class by helping students realize how an eternal perspective can influence decisions they make. To do this, you could write the following on the board. Invite students to discuss how each of these decisions when they are young can affect their future. How I treat my body How I spend my free time How I treat people Then share the following statement and invite students to make connections between the decisions above and what President Nelson taught. President Russell M. Nelson taught the following about our choices. Every righteous choice that you make here will pay huge dividends now. But righteous choices in mortality will pay unimaginable dividends eternally. … The adversary, of course, does not want you even to think about tomorrow, let alone eternal life. (“ Choices for Eternity ” [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 15, 2022], Gospel Library) How might failing to view our choices with an eternal perspective affect us? Write down a decision you are currently facing that could “pay unimaginable dividends eternally.” It could help to give students some ideas about the kinds of decisions they might write down, such as: Whether to continue spending time with a certain group of friends. Whether to repent of a sin that has been on their mind. What they choose to do on the Sabbath. Ponder why Heavenly Father might want you to think about the future as you make this decision. What might happen if you don’t? As you study Ecclesiastes today, seek to understand truths and receive personal revelation from the Lord that can help you with this decision. Focusing on temporal things In the book of Ecclesiastes, the author referred to himself as “the Preacher” ( Ecclesiastes 1:1 ). The Preacher contrasted the emptiness of focusing our lives on temporal things with the importance of preparing to meet God. Consider creating small groups and inviting each group to read one of the passages below. To help students better understand the passages, you could display the following definitions. Invite students to substitute the following words and phrases with their definitions as they read: “Vanity” means empty or fleeting. “Under heaven” or “under the sun” means in this mortal life. “Vexation of spirit” means frustrating. Read the following passages, looking for what the Preacher discovered after pursuing certain things that some people think will make them happy and bring fulfillment: Wisdom of the world. Ecclesiastes 1:13–18 Temporal pleasures and material possessions. Ecclesiastes 2:1, 4–11 You might want to clarify that worldly wisdom and material possessions are not necessarily bad or wrong. But when these things become our focus, especially over pleasing God, they become spiritually dangerous. Invite groups to discuss the following question. Then a group member could share the group’s insights with the class. In what ways might pursuing these things eventually leave us feeling empty or frustrated? Our eventual meeting with God After seeking temporal knowledge and possessions, the Preacher ends his book with the lessons he learned. Read Ecclesiastes 12:7, 13–14 , looking for what he taught that can help us keep an eternal perspective. This perspective is so important that God has inspired many of His servants to teach it. Cross-reference or link Ecclesiastes 12:7, 13–14 with Alma 34:32 and Mormon 3:20, 22 . Read these passages, looking for how Amulek and Mormon taught a similar message. How would you summarize what these verses teach in a statement of truth? Help students identify a truth like: Our choices in this life will determine how prepared we are to stand before God at the Final Judgment. Before students answer the next question, you could invite them to close their eyes and imagine meeting God after this life. Encourage them to consider what they know about Him and His attributes. What attributes of God uniquely qualify Him to be our Judge? You might remind students of Jesus Christ’s role in helping us prepare for the Final Judgment by sharing the following scripture and question. Read 3 Nephi 27:16, 19 , looking for how we can prepare to meet Jesus Christ at the Final Judgment. Why is it important to understand that we cannot prepare for the Final Judgment without Jesus Christ? Our celestial goal Help students see how knowing that our choices prepare us for eternity can affect the daily decisions we make. One way to do this is by letting students practice what President Nelson taught in the following statement. President Russell M. Nelson testified of the importance of beginning “with the end in mind”: 19:15 In my first message as President of the Church, I encouraged you to begin with the end in mind. This means making the celestial kingdom your eternal goal and then carefully considering where each of your decisions while here on earth will place you in the next world. (“ Think Celestial! ,” Liahona , Nov. 2023, 118) In what ways do Jesus Christ’s teachings and example show that He made decisions “with the end in mind”? Explain that students will practice applying what President Nelson is teaching. Before they begin, you could ask them to think of decisions that will impact them in the next life. Add these decisions to the list of decisions on the board from the beginning of class. Students could then discuss the following in small groups. Pick one of the decisions on the board and answer the following questions: What decisions might a teenager make about this that will affect their preparation to meet God? What have you learned from the gospel of Jesus Christ that could help a teenager make decisions about this? Invite groups to share their insights with the class. You might encourage students to find and share scriptures or statements from Church leaders that support what they share. The conclusion Before students complete the following activity, you might remind them about the decision they wrote down at the beginning of class. Imagine standing before God at the Final Judgment and hearing Him tell you, “Well done, good and faithful servant” ( Matthew 25:23 ). Now imagine that, while standing before God, you have the opportunity to send a message back in time to your current self. Write a message giving your current self advice that will help you prepare for the Final Judgment. You could include what you learned and felt today about: How choices when you are young affect your preparation to meet God. What adjustments you would encourage yourself to make about decisions you are currently facing. Consider testifying of the importance of making decisions with a focus on the day we will stand before God to be judged.",

(“ Think Celestial! ,” Liahona , Nov. 2023, 118) In what ways do Jesus Christ’s teachings and example show that He made decisions “with the end in mind”? Explain that students will practice applying what President Nelson is teaching. Before they begin, you could ask them to think of decisions that will impact them in the next life. Add these decisions to the list of decisions on the board from the beginning of class. Students could then discuss the following in small groups. Pick one of the decisions on the board and answer the following questions: What decisions might a teenager make about this that will affect their preparation to meet God? What have you learned from the gospel of Jesus Christ that could help a teenager make decisions about this? Invite groups to share their insights with the class. You might encourage students to find and share scriptures or statements from Church leaders that support what they share. The conclusion Before students complete the following activity, you might remind them about the decision they wrote down at the beginning of class. Imagine standing before God at the Final Judgment and hearing Him tell you, “Well done, good and faithful servant” ( Matthew 25:23 ). Now imagine that, while standing before God, you have the opportunity to send a message back in time to your current self. Write a message giving your current self advice that will help you prepare for the Final Judgment. You could include what you learned and felt today about: How choices when you are young affect your preparation to meet God. What adjustments you would encourage yourself to make about decisions you are currently facing. Consider testifying of the importance of making decisions with a focus on the day we will stand before God to be judged.",
