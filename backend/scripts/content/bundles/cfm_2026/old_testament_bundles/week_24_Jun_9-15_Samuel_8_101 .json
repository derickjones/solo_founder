Though tall and handsome, he was “little in [his] own sight” and self-conscious about his family heritage (see\n1 Samuel 9:2–3, 21\n;\n15:17\n). On the day he was to be presented before Israel as their king, he didn’t show up; he was so nervous he “hid himself” (\n1 Samuel 10:21–22\n). Looking at Saul, you might not have guessed that he would lead the Israelites to victory over their enemies—or that he would later become prideful and rebel against the Lord.\nDavid was a keeper of sheep. He wasn’t as physically impressive as his seven older brothers. On the day Samuel came to choose a new king for Israel, it didn’t seem worthwhile to include David among the possible candidates, so he was left out in the fields with the sheep. Looking at David, you might not have guessed that he would have the faith and courage to defeat a giant and become Israel’s most successful king.\nBut the Lord sees past our labels, our physical appearance, our insecurities. He looks, instead, “on the heart” (\n1 Samuel 16:7\n). And even when our heart isn’t quite right, if we’re willing, He will give us “another heart” (\n1 Samuel 10:9\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n1 Samuel 8\nJesus Christ is my King.\n1 Samuel 8\ntells of an event that would forever change the destiny of the Israelites. For protection against their enemies, the Israelites wanted what their neighbors had—a king to rule over them. As you read about their request and the Lord’s response, think about who you look to for safety and guidance. Consider what it means to let the Lord “reign over [you]” (\n1 Samuel 8:7\n).\nOver the coming weeks, you will read about a number of kings called to lead Israel. As you learn about them, consider the following questions:\nHow were the Lord’s warnings fulfilled in\n1 Samuel 8:10–18\n?\nHow were the children of Israel affected by their choice to have an earthly king?\nHow is Jesus Christ different from earthly kings? Consider what worldly influences you may need to remove from your life to let Christ be your King.\nSee also “\nRejoice, the Lord Is King!\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 66.\n1 Samuel 9–10\n;\n16:1–13\nGod calls people by prophecy to serve in His kingdom.\nRead about how God chose Israel’s kings in\n1 Samuel 9–10\nand\n16\n(see especially\n9:15–17\n;\n10:1–12\n;\n16:1–13\n). Look for passages that help you understand what it means to “be called of God, by prophecy” in the Lord’s Church today (\nArticles of Faith 1:5\n). You might consider putting yourself in the place of the leader extending the calling (Samuel), the person being called (Saul and David), and the people they are called to serve (the Israelites).

Why do you think this happened? In\n1 Samuel 13:5–14\n, what attitudes and behaviors do you see that led to his downfall?\nIn\n1 Samuel 15\n, you’ll read about a commandment from the Lord that Saul didn’t obey because he thought he had a good reason.

Maybe you ate something that wasn’t as good as it looked. Or maybe you judged someone unfairly.\nWhen Samuel was looking for a new king of Israel, the Lord taught him a better way. Read about it in\n1 Samuel 16:6–7\n, and consider making a list of ways people judge others “on the outward appearance.” You can find some examples in Elder Christophe G. Giraud-Carrier’s message “\nWe Are His Children\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 114–16). What does it mean to look “on the heart,” as the Lord does? (\n1 Samuel 16:7\n). You can find examples of this, too, in Elder Giraud-Carrier’s message. Maybe you can think of other times when the Savior looked past a person’s outward appearance. (See, for instance,\nMark 12:41–44\n;\nLuke 5:1–11\n;\n19:1–9\n;\nJohn 4:5–30\n;\nMoses 6:31–36\n.)

As a result, many Israelites adopted the wicked practices of these people and lost the Lord’s protection. However, each time the Israelites cried unto the Lord for deliverance, He “raised up a deliverer” for them ( Judges 3:9 ). This lesson can help students understand the Savior’s role as our Deliverer. Student preparation: Invite students to think of a time when the Savior delivered (rescued or set free) someone in the scriptures, someone they know, or themselves. Students could identify what the individual or individuals did to reach out to the Savior for deliverance. Possible Learning Activities Patterns To prepare students to learn about a spiritual pattern found in the book of Judges, consider displaying the following numerical patterns. Invite small groups of students to fill in the missing numbers. Find the next two numbers in each of the following sequences: A. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, , B. 1, 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, , C. 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, , D. 10, 11, 6, 8, 4, 7, 4, , If students need help, you could share the following patterns: A: +2 B: +2, +4, +6, and so on C: +3, −1, +3, −1 D: +1, −5, +2, −4, +3, −3, and so on What are situations in our lives when it might be helpful to identify patterns? Why is it important to recognize spiritual patterns in our lives? Today as you study a spiritual pattern the Israelites experienced in the book of Judges, think about how it could apply to your life. Invite the Holy Ghost to teach you more about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you study this pattern. The cycle of sin and deliverance When the Israelites entered the promised land, the Lord commanded them to drive out the wicked inhabitants (see Deuteronomy 7:1–4 ). Many Israelites chose not to fully obey this commandment. They allowed some of the wicked inhabitants to remain (see Judges 1:21, 27–28 ). In Judges 2–4 , we learn about a spiritual pattern, or cycle, the Israelites experienced because they repeatedly failed to follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Consider displaying the following cycle on the board. Invite students to copy it in their study journals. Invite the students to study the following verses with a partner or small group, looking for the pattern of behavior that occurred among the Israelites. Students could summarize each set of verses with a word or phrase. They could then write that word or phrase in the appropriate box on their diagrams. 1. Judges 3:5–7 (Note: Baalim is the plural form of Baal, a false god worshipped in Canaan. The term groves refers to “a living tree or a tree-like pole, set up as an object of worship” [Bible Dictionary, “ Grove ”].) 2. Judges 3:8 3. Judges 3:9 (first phrase of verse) 4. Judges 3:9–11 After students have studied the verses, invite them to share the words or phrases they included on their diagrams. If needed, you could offer the following suggestions for each box: 1. Sin ; 2. Consequences ; 3. Cry unto the Lord ; 4. Deliverance through the Lord . To help students record this cycle in their scriptures, you could invite them to write the word or phrase from each box by each set of verses. Then display the following instructions. Give students a few minutes to study some or all of the references. To see other examples of this cycle in Judges 2–4 , study some of the following references. As you notice different elements of the cycle, you could label them in your scriptures. (Note: Not every element of the cycle will appear in every set of verses.) Judges 2:10–18 Judges 3:12–15, 26–30 Judges 4:1–4, 14–16 What can we learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from this cycle in Judges 2–4 ? As students share answers to the previous question, consider pointing out their insights that show God’s love and attributes. One way to do this is to make simple statements after students share. You could say, “Thank you for your insight about the merciful nature of Jesus Christ” or “I’m grateful for your reminder of the power the Savior has to deliver us” or “Why is it important to know that Heavenly Father also has that attribute that you noticed in the Savior?” (For additional training on helping students come unto Jesus Christ, see “ Help Learners Strengthen Their Relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills [2022], 9.) Some truths students might discover about the Lord in these passages are: If we choose to reject the Lord, we will lose His guidance and protection in our lives. As we choose to turn to the Lord and call upon His name, He will deliver us. How do you think understanding these truths could affect your life? The Deliverer Explain that one of the titles of the Savior is Deliverer (see 2 Samuel 22:2 ). Students could read and compare Mosiah 7:33 to Judges 3:9 . Ask them to share how the individuals who helped deliver the Israelites in the book of Judges symbolize Jesus Christ. To help students pause and personalize what they have been learning, you could write “me” on the board in the center of the cycle. Invite students to ponder where they might currently be in the cycle. Ask them to think about situations in their lives where they need the Savior’s deliverance. Elder Kyle S. McKay of the Seventy testified of how Jesus Christ is the Great Deliverer: 11:39 I bear witness that Jesus Christ is the Great Deliverer, and in His name, I promise that as you turn to Him with real intent and full purpose of heart, He will deliver you from everything that threatens to diminish or destroy your life or joy. (“ The Immediate Goodness of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 107) What thoughts or feelings do you have as you reflect on this statement? Consider giving students time to list in their journals or on the board any threats that could “diminish or destroy [their] life or joy.” If helpful, students could study the article “ The Savior Can Deliver Us ” (Jessica Z. Strong, For the Strength of Youth , Dec. 2022, 2–4), looking for examples. Next to the list they created, students could write responses to the following question. What are some ways the Savior can deliver us when we turn to Him? Help students discover additional ways the Savior can deliver us as we turn to Him. They could think of examples of the Savior’s deliverance in the scriptures, their own lives, or the lives of people they know. You could invite students to find scriptures that teach about the Lord’s power to deliver, such as Alma 36:27–29 ; 38:5 . They could also read “ 7 Ways the Lord Can Deliver You ” (David A. Edwards, For the Strength of Youth , Apr. 2022, 18–20). Invite volunteers to share their insights. You could also invite them to explain how remembering these examples can help them strengthen their faith and trust in the Savior. Demonstrate understanding To help students demonstrate their understanding of the Savior’s role as Deliverer, display the following instructions. They could complete the activity with a partner or a small group. Create a scenario about a young person who needs the Savior’s deliverance from a certain situation. Write a paragraph that summarizes what you have learned about how the Savior can deliver this person. Consider having students complete step 1 and then share their scenario with a different partnership or group. They could then complete step 2 in response to the other group’s scenario. You could conclude this lesson by sharing an experience or testimony of the Savior’s power to deliver.\n\n\n--- Lesson 66 ---\nAfter the Israelites prayed for deliverance, the Lord called Gideon to deliver them from their enemies. The Lord demonstrated His strength by helping the Israelites defeat an army of over 135,000 soldiers with only 300 of Gideon’s men. This lesson can help students feel a greater desire to rely on Jesus Christ for strength. Student preparation: Invite students to find a scripture that demonstrates the strength we can receive from the Lord. Come to class prepared to share it. Possible Learning Activities Different types of strength On the board, consider drawing a stick figure holding weights in each hand, like the following: Ask the following questions. If useful, hand multiple students markers, and have them write one of their answers around the drawing on the board. Who are some people you would consider to be “strong”? What are different ways a person could be seen as strong? Explain that one type of strength is a person’s ability to rely on the Lord. Consider giving students the chance to assess how much they rely on the Lord in challenging situations that they might face. You might use the following situations or think of others more relevant to your students. Think about how likely you are to rely on God’s strength in different situations. For each situation listed below, determine where you would place yourself on the following diagram. Making important decisions Dealing with an injury or sickness Improving as a person Working through challenges with family or friends As you study about Gideon today, pray for Heavenly Father to help you feel the importance of relying on the Lord for strength in your life. Pay attention to thoughts or feelings that God may send you through the Holy Ghost. Gideon and the Israelites To help students understand the context of Judges 6 , you might review the graphic of the pride cycle from Lesson 65: “ Judges 2–4 .” You could also read or summarize the following paragraph. Judges 6 describes another instance when the Israelites forgot the Lord and lost His blessings. A group of people called the Midianites began to oppress the Israelites. For seven years the Midianites plundered the Israelites’ grain and animals during the seasons of harvest. As a result, the Israelites suffered poverty. In desperation, they turned to the Lord for help. After the Israelites remembered the Lord and cried unto Him, He raised up a righteous man named Gideon to deliver them from their enemies. To help students see how the Lord blessed Gideon and his army for relying on Him for their strength, consider using the handout “ Seeing the Lord’s Strength in the Account of Gideon .” Allow each student to become familiar with the content of each section of the handout. There are several ways you might do this. One way would be to arrange students into groups of three and assign each member a section of the handout. Students could complete their section and then teach the other group members what they learned. They could go in the order of the sections on the handout. Another way would be to invite students to work on the first section of the handout with a partner. After sufficient time, students could switch partners and work on the second section, and then again with the third section. Open PDF Relying on the Lord After students have finished the handout, invite them to share a summary of what they learned from Gideon’s story. Ask a few students to share the truth they wrote for study activity 3. The following is one example: If we rely on the Lord, He will bless us with His strength. What are different ways the Lord can strengthen us? How can we rely on the Lord today? To further understand this truth, invite students to imagine their friend texted them. The friend is in a situation where they feel their strength is not enough. Have students share a few examples of what this situation could be. Ask the class to select a situation that they feel would be most meaningful to address today. Prepare an answer that you could text back. Write it in your study journal. If you want, draw a phone with text bubbles, and write your answer inside. Your answer should include at least two of the following: 1. How the example of Gideon could help. 2. How other scriptures might help your friend rely on the Lord. (Some examples are Proverbs 3:5–6 ; Philippians 4:13 ; Alma 26:12 ; Ether 12:27 . You could also look up “ Strength ” in the Topical Guide or “ Trust ” in the Guide to the Scriptures.) 3. What you know about the Lord that helps you rely on Him. 4. Experiences you have had when you have felt the Lord strengthen you beyond your own abilities. Invite several students to share their answers. Look for ways to thank them for their participation and to point out how meaningful their responses can be to you and their classmates. It might be helpful to share a personal experience about how you have been strengthened by relying on the Lord. You might also show the video “ Just Keep Going—with Faith ” ( ChurchofJesusChrist.org ) from time code 6:08 to 9:47. Elder Carl B. Cook of the Seventy shared an experience when he was a new Area Seventy. He was assigned to attend a stake conference with President Boyd K. Packer. When Elder Cook asked President Packer how he wanted to plan the meeting, President Packer said he wanted to follow the Spirit. 11:5 Conclusion Invite students to seek Heavenly Father’s guidance as they answer the following questions in their study journals. What is an area in your life where you feel like your own strength is not enough? What do you know or what have you learned about the Lord that would help you rely on Him? How do you feel about the Lord and His help?",

Invite small groups of students to fill in the missing numbers. Find the next two numbers in each of the following sequences: A. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, , B. 1, 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, , C. 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, , D. 10, 11, 6, 8, 4, 7, 4, , If students need help, you could share the following patterns: A: +2 B: +2, +4, +6, and so on C: +3, −1, +3, −1 D: +1, −5, +2, −4, +3, −3, and so on What are situations in our lives when it might be helpful to identify patterns? Why is it important to recognize spiritual patterns in our lives? Today as you study a spiritual pattern the Israelites experienced in the book of Judges, think about how it could apply to your life. Invite the Holy Ghost to teach you more about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you study this pattern. The cycle of sin and deliverance When the Israelites entered the promised land, the Lord commanded them to drive out the wicked inhabitants (see Deuteronomy 7:1–4 ). Many Israelites chose not to fully obey this commandment. They allowed some of the wicked inhabitants to remain (see Judges 1:21, 27–28 ). In Judges 2–4 , we learn about a spiritual pattern, or cycle, the Israelites experienced because they repeatedly failed to follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Consider displaying the following cycle on the board. Invite students to copy it in their study journals. Invite the students to study the following verses with a partner or small group, looking for the pattern of behavior that occurred among the Israelites. Students could summarize each set of verses with a word or phrase. They could then write that word or phrase in the appropriate box on their diagrams. 1. Judges 3:5–7 (Note: Baalim is the plural form of Baal, a false god worshipped in Canaan. The term groves refers to “a living tree or a tree-like pole, set up as an object of worship” [Bible Dictionary, “ Grove ”].) 2. Judges 3:8 3. Judges 3:9 (first phrase of verse) 4. Judges 3:9–11 After students have studied the verses, invite them to share the words or phrases they included on their diagrams. If needed, you could offer the following suggestions for each box: 1. Sin ; 2. Consequences ; 3. Cry unto the Lord ; 4. Deliverance through the Lord . To help students record this cycle in their scriptures, you could invite them to write the word or phrase from each box by each set of verses. Then display the following instructions. Give students a few minutes to study some or all of the references. To see other examples of this cycle in Judges 2–4 , study some of the following references. As you notice different elements of the cycle, you could label them in your scriptures. (Note: Not every element of the cycle will appear in every set of verses.) Judges 2:10–18 Judges 3:12–15, 26–30 Judges 4:1–4, 14–16 What can we learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from this cycle in Judges 2–4 ? As students share answers to the previous question, consider pointing out their insights that show God’s love and attributes. One way to do this is to make simple statements after students share. You could say, “Thank you for your insight about the merciful nature of Jesus Christ” or “I’m grateful for your reminder of the power the Savior has to deliver us” or “Why is it important to know that Heavenly Father also has that attribute that you noticed in the Savior?” (For additional training on helping students come unto Jesus Christ, see “ Help Learners Strengthen Their Relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills [2022], 9.) Some truths students might discover about the Lord in these passages are: If we choose to reject the Lord, we will lose His guidance and protection in our lives. As we choose to turn to the Lord and call upon His name, He will deliver us. How do you think understanding these truths could affect your life? The Deliverer Explain that one of the titles of the Savior is Deliverer (see 2 Samuel 22:2 ). Students could read and compare Mosiah 7:33 to Judges 3:9 . Ask them to share how the individuals who helped deliver the Israelites in the book of Judges symbolize Jesus Christ. To help students pause and personalize what they have been learning, you could write “me” on the board in the center of the cycle. Invite students to ponder where they might currently be in the cycle. Ask them to think about situations in their lives where they need the Savior’s deliverance. Elder Kyle S. McKay of the Seventy testified of how Jesus Christ is the Great Deliverer: 11:39 I bear witness that Jesus Christ is the Great Deliverer, and in His name, I promise that as you turn to Him with real intent and full purpose of heart, He will deliver you from everything that threatens to diminish or destroy your life or joy. (“ The Immediate Goodness of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 107) What thoughts or feelings do you have as you reflect on this statement? Consider giving students time to list in their journals or on the board any threats that could “diminish or destroy [their] life or joy.” If helpful, students could study the article “ The Savior Can Deliver Us ” (Jessica Z. Strong, For the Strength of Youth , Dec. 2022, 2–4), looking for examples. Next to the list they created, students could write responses to the following question. What are some ways the Savior can deliver us when we turn to Him? Help students discover additional ways the Savior can deliver us as we turn to Him. They could think of examples of the Savior’s deliverance in the scriptures, their own lives, or the lives of people they know. You could invite students to find scriptures that teach about the Lord’s power to deliver, such as Alma 36:27–29 ; 38:5 . They could also read “ 7 Ways the Lord Can Deliver You ” (David A. Edwards, For the Strength of Youth , Apr. 2022, 18–20). Invite volunteers to share their insights. You could also invite them to explain how remembering these examples can help them strengthen their faith and trust in the Savior. Demonstrate understanding To help students demonstrate their understanding of the Savior’s role as Deliverer, display the following instructions. They could complete the activity with a partner or a small group. Create a scenario about a young person who needs the Savior’s deliverance from a certain situation. Write a paragraph that summarizes what you have learned about how the Savior can deliver this person. Consider having students complete step 1 and then share their scenario with a different partnership or group. They could then complete step 2 in response to the other group’s scenario. You could conclude this lesson by sharing an experience or testimony of the Savior’s power to deliver.\n\n\n--- Lesson 66 ---\nAfter the Israelites prayed for deliverance, the Lord called Gideon to deliver them from their enemies. The Lord demonstrated His strength by helping the Israelites defeat an army of over 135,000 soldiers with only 300 of Gideon’s men. This lesson can help students feel a greater desire to rely on Jesus Christ for strength. Student preparation: Invite students to find a scripture that demonstrates the strength we can receive from the Lord. Come to class prepared to share it. Possible Learning Activities Different types of strength On the board, consider drawing a stick figure holding weights in each hand, like the following: Ask the following questions. If useful, hand multiple students markers, and have them write one of their answers around the drawing on the board. Who are some people you would consider to be “strong”? What are different ways a person could be seen as strong? Explain that one type of strength is a person’s ability to rely on the Lord. Consider giving students the chance to assess how much they rely on the Lord in challenging situations that they might face. You might use the following situations or think of others more relevant to your students. Think about how likely you are to rely on God’s strength in different situations. For each situation listed below, determine where you would place yourself on the following diagram. Making important decisions Dealing with an injury or sickness Improving as a person Working through challenges with family or friends As you study about Gideon today, pray for Heavenly Father to help you feel the importance of relying on the Lord for strength in your life. Pay attention to thoughts or feelings that God may send you through the Holy Ghost. Gideon and the Israelites To help students understand the context of Judges 6 , you might review the graphic of the pride cycle from Lesson 65: “ Judges 2–4 .” You could also read or summarize the following paragraph. Judges 6 describes another instance when the Israelites forgot the Lord and lost His blessings. A group of people called the Midianites began to oppress the Israelites. For seven years the Midianites plundered the Israelites’ grain and animals during the seasons of harvest. As a result, the Israelites suffered poverty. In desperation, they turned to the Lord for help. After the Israelites remembered the Lord and cried unto Him, He raised up a righteous man named Gideon to deliver them from their enemies. To help students see how the Lord blessed Gideon and his army for relying on Him for their strength, consider using the handout “ Seeing the Lord’s Strength in the Account of Gideon .” Allow each student to become familiar with the content of each section of the handout. There are several ways you might do this. One way would be to arrange students into groups of three and assign each member a section of the handout. Students could complete their section and then teach the other group members what they learned. They could go in the order of the sections on the handout. Another way would be to invite students to work on the first section of the handout with a partner. After sufficient time, students could switch partners and work on the second section, and then again with the third section. Open PDF Relying on the Lord After students have finished the handout, invite them to share a summary of what they learned from Gideon’s story. Ask a few students to share the truth they wrote for study activity 3. The following is one example: If we rely on the Lord, He will bless us with His strength. What are different ways the Lord can strengthen us? How can we rely on the Lord today? To further understand this truth, invite students to imagine their friend texted them. The friend is in a situation where they feel their strength is not enough. Have students share a few examples of what this situation could be. Ask the class to select a situation that they feel would be most meaningful to address today. Prepare an answer that you could text back. Write it in your study journal. If you want, draw a phone with text bubbles, and write your answer inside. Your answer should include at least two of the following: 1. How the example of Gideon could help. 2. How other scriptures might help your friend rely on the Lord. (Some examples are Proverbs 3:5–6 ; Philippians 4:13 ; Alma 26:12 ; Ether 12:27 . You could also look up “ Strength ” in the Topical Guide or “ Trust ” in the Guide to the Scriptures.) 3. What you know about the Lord that helps you rely on Him. 4. Experiences you have had when you have felt the Lord strengthen you beyond your own abilities. Invite several students to share their answers. Look for ways to thank them for their participation and to point out how meaningful their responses can be to you and their classmates. It might be helpful to share a personal experience about how you have been strengthened by relying on the Lord. You might also show the video “ Just Keep Going—with Faith ” ( ChurchofJesusChrist.org ) from time code 6:08 to 9:47. Elder Carl B. Cook of the Seventy shared an experience when he was a new Area Seventy. He was assigned to attend a stake conference with President Boyd K. Packer. When Elder Cook asked President Packer how he wanted to plan the meeting, President Packer said he wanted to follow the Spirit. 11:5 Conclusion Invite students to seek Heavenly Father’s guidance as they answer the following questions in their study journals. What is an area in your life where you feel like your own strength is not enough? What do you know or what have you learned about the Lord that would help you rely on Him? How do you feel about the Lord and His help?",
