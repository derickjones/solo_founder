It also ended on a mountain, more than 40 years later, when God gave him a glimpse of the promised land from the top of Mount Nebo (see\nDeuteronomy 34:1–4\n). Moses had spent his life preparing the children of Israel to enter that promised land, and the book of Deuteronomy records his final instructions, reminders, exhortations, and pleadings with the Israelites. Reading his words makes it clear that the real object of Moses’s ministry—the preparation the people needed—wasn’t about wilderness survival, conquering enemies, or building a nation. It was about learning to love God, obey Him, and remain loyal to Him. That’s the preparation we all need to enter the promised land of eternal life. So although Moses never set foot in the “land flowing with milk and honey” (\nExodus 3:8\n), because of his faith and faithfulness, he did enter the promised land that God has prepared for all those who follow Him.\nFor an overview of Deuteronomy, see “\nDeuteronomy\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDeuteronomy 6:4–7\n;\n8:2–5, 11–17\n;\n29:18–20\n;\n30:6–10, 14–20\n“Love the Lord thy God with all thine heart.”\nThe law of Moses included many outward ceremonies and rituals. As you’ll see in Moses’s counsel in Deuteronomy, the Lord was also concerned about His people’s inward state—the spiritual condition of their hearts.\nIn the passages below, look for the word\nheart\n, and ponder what it might symbolize. You might think of these passages as a kind of spiritual checkup on your heart. What diagnosis would you give yourself? What treatments would you prescribe to improve the spiritual health of your heart? Write down your impressions:\nDeuteronomy 6:4–7\n:\nDeuteronomy 8:2–5\n:\nDeuteronomy 8:11–17\n:\nDeuteronomy 29:18–20\n:\nDeuteronomy 30:6–10\n:\nDeuteronomy 30:14–20\n:\nOne way to organize your thoughts could be to draw a heart and write inside it things that the Lord says you should have in your heart. Then you could write outside it things that you should keep out of your heart.\nHow do you show that you love God with all your heart? For ideas, see “\nLove God, love your neighbor\n” in\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n, 10–12.\nSee also M. Russell Ballard, “\nLovest Thou Me More Than These?\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 51–53.\nSeek your own spiritual insights.\nCome, Follow Me\nsuggests passages and principles to focus on in the scriptures, but don’t let that limit your study. As you read Deuteronomy, you might discover a principle that is not highlighted here. Let the Spirit guide you to what you need to learn.\nDeuteronomy 6:4–12, 20–25\n“Beware lest thou forget the Lord.”\nMost of the Israelites who would enter the promised land had not seen the plagues in Egypt or crossed the Red Sea. Moses knew that they—and future generations—would need to remember God’s miracles and God’s laws to remain God’s people.\nWhat counsel do you find in\nDeuteronomy 6:4–12, 20–25\nthat could help you remember the great things God has done for you? What are you inspired to do so that the word of the Lord will daily “be in thine heart”? (\nverse 6\n).\nYou might also study Brother Jan E. Newman’s message “\nPreserving the Voice of the Covenant People in the Rising Generation\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 36–38) and consider how you will pass your faith in Christ to future generations.\nSee also\nDeuteronomy 11:18–21\n; Dale G.

(see\nverse 15\n).\nSee also “\nHave I Done Any Good?\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 223.\nDeuteronomy 18:15–19\nMoses was “like unto” Jesus Christ.\nPeter, Nephi, Moroni, and the Savior Himself all commented on the prophecy in\nDeuteronomy 18:15–19\n(see\nActs 3:20–23\n;\n1 Nephi 22:20–21\n;\nJoseph Smith—History 1:40\n;\n3 Nephi 20:23\n). What do you learn about the Savior from these verses? Think about what you’ve read about Moses over the past few weeks.

Your children could point to the pictures as you read the words “heart,” “soul,” and “might” in the verse. How do we show the Lord that we love Him with all our heart, soul, and might?\nDeuteronomy 6:6–15\nI can keep the word of God in my heart.\nRead with your children the Lord’s counsel to the Israelites to put scripture passages where they would see them every day (see\nDeuteronomy 6:6–9\n). This might inspire you and your children to think of ways to make sure you don’t “forget the Lord” (\nverse 12\n) and to remember what He has done for you.\nYou might point out that\nDeuteronomy 6:13, 16\nand\n8:3\nhelped the Savior during an important moment in His life. To see how, read together\nMatthew 4:1–10\n. Then you could share with each other some scripture passages that have helped you in times of need.\nDeuteronomy 18:15–18\nProphets teach us about Jesus Christ.\nAs you read\nDeuteronomy 18:18\ntogether, help your children understand that the Prophet like Moses in this verse is Jesus Christ. Maybe you could look at pictures of things Moses did and things Jesus Christ did, and let your children match them (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 15\n,\n16\n,\n38\n,\n39\n). What has our prophet today taught us about the Savior?\nDeuteronomy 29:12–13\n;\n30:8–10\nBecause of my covenants, I am part of God’s people.\nTalking about\nDeuteronomy 29:12–13\nprovides an opportunity for you and your children to talk about covenants they will make or have made with Heavenly Father. What does it mean to be God’s people? How do our promises make us God’s people? (see\nverse 13\n; see also\nMosiah 18:8–10\n).\nIf your children need help understanding what a covenant is, suggest that they find a definition in “\nCovenant\n” in the Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library). What promises did God and the Israelites make with each other in\nDeuteronomy 30:8–10\n? What promises have we made with God? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37, 77\n). How do these promises connect us with Him? Consider singing together a song about covenants, such as “Standing on the Promises” (Gospel Library).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Deuteronomy 6 ---\n1. Now thesearethe commandments, thestatutes, and thejudgments, which theLordyour God commanded to teach you, that ye might dothemin the land whither ye go to possess it:\n2. That thou mightest fear theLordthy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy sons son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may beprolonged.\n3. Hear therefore, O Israel, andobserveto doit;that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as theLordGod of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.\n4. Hear, O Israel: TheLordour GodisoneLord:\n5. And thou shaltlovetheLordthy God with all thineheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thymight.\n6. And thesewords, which I command thee this day, shall be in thineheart:\n7. And thou shaltteachthem diligently unto thy children, and shalttalkof them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\n8. And thou shaltbindthem for asignupon thine hand, and they shall be asfrontletsbetween thine eyes.\n9. And thou shalt write them upon thepostsof thy house, and on thy gates.\n10. And it shall be, when theLordthy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,\n11. And houses full of all goodthings,which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;\n12. Thenbeware lest thouforgettheLord, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.\n13. Thou shaltfeartheLordthy God, andservehim, and shaltswearby his name.\n14. Ye shall not go afterothergods, of the gods of the people whichareround about you;\n15. (For theLordthy GodisajealousGod among you) lest theangerof theLordthy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.\n16. Ye shall nottempttheLordyour God, as ye temptedhimin Massah.\n17. Ye shalldiligentlykeep thecommandmentsof theLordyour God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.\n18. And thou shalt dothat which isrightand good in the sight of theLord: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which theLordswareunto thy fathers,\n19. Tocast outall thine enemies from before thee, as theLordhath spoken.\n20. Andwhen thy sonaskeththee in time to come, saying, Whatmeanthetestimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which theLordour God hath commanded you?\n21. Then thou shalt say unto thyson, We were Pharaohs bondmen in Egypt; and theLordbrought us out of Egypt with mighty hand:\n22. And theLordshewed signs and wonders, great andsore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:\n23. And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, togive us the land which he sware unto our fathers.\n24. And theLordcommandedus to do all these statutes, tofeartheLordour God, for ourgoodalways, that he mightpreserveus alive, asit isat this day.\n25. And it shall be ourrighteousness, if weobserveto do all these commandments before theLordour God, as he hath commanded us.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Deuteronomy 7 ---\n1. When theLordthy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, sevennationsgreater and mightier than thou;\n2. And when theLordthy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them,andutterlydestroythem; thou shaltmakenocovenantwith them, nor shew mercy unto them:\n3. Neither shalt thou makemarriageswith them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.\n4. For they willturn awaythy son from following me, that they mayserveother gods: so will theangerof theLordbe kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.\n5. But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shalldestroytheir altars, and break down theirimages, and cut down theirgroves, and burn their graven images with fire.\n6. For thouartanholypeople unto theLordthy God: theLordthy God hathchosenthee to be aspecialpeople unto himself, above all people thatareupon the face of the earth.\n7. TheLorddid not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for yewerethe fewest of all people:\n8. But because theLordlovedyou, and because he would keep theoathwhich he had sworn unto your fathers, hath theLordbrought you out with mighty hand, andredeemedyou out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.\n9. Know therefore that theLordthy God, heisGod, the faithful God, whichkeepethcovenant andmercywith them that love him and keep his commandments to thousand generations;\n10. Andrepayeththem that hate him to their face, todestroythem: he will not be slack to him thathatethhim, he will repay him to his face.\n11. Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and thejudgments, which Icommandthee this day, to do them.\n12. Wherefore it shall come to pass, if yehearkento thesejudgments, and keep, and do them, that theLordthy God shall keep unto thee thecovenantand the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:\n13. And he willlovethee, and bless thee, andmultiplythee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and thefruitof thy land, thycorn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.\n14. Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or femalebarrenamong you, or among your cattle.\n15. And theLordwill take away from thee allsickness, and will put none of the evildiseasesof Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon allthemthat hate thee.\n16. And thou shalt consume all the people which theLordthy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve theirgods; for thatwill bea snare unto thee.\n17. If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nationsaremore than I; how can I dispossess them?\n18. Thou shalt not be afraid of them:butshalt well remember what theLordthy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;\n19. The greattemptationswhich thine eyes saw, and the signs, and thewonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby theLordthy God brought thee out: so shall theLordthy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.\n20. Moreover theLordthy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.\n21. Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for theLordthy Godisamong you, mighty God andterrible.\n22. And theLordthy God willput outthose nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest thebeastsof the field increase upon thee.\n23. But theLordthy God shalldeliverthem unto thee, and shalldestroythem with mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.\n24. And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.\n25. The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or goldthat ison them, nor takeitunto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for itisan abomination to theLordthy God.\n26. Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be cursed thing like it:butthou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for itisa cursed thing.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Deuteronomy 8 ---\n1. All the commandments which Icommandthee this day shall yeobserve to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which theLordsware unto your fathers.\n2. And thou shalt remember all the way which theLordthy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, tohumblethee,andtoprovethee, to know whatwasin thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.\n3. And hehumbledthee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee withmanna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know thatmandoth not live bybreadonly, but by everywordthat proceedeth out of the mouth of theLorddoth man live.\n4. Thyraiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.\n5. Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as manchastenethhis son,sotheLordthy God chasteneth thee.\n6. Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of theLordthy God, towalkin his ways, and to fear him.\n7. For theLordthy God bringeth thee into agoodland, land of brooks of water, offountainsand depths that spring out of valleys and hills;\n8. A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; land ofoil olive, and honey;\n9. A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anythingin it; land whose stonesareiron, and out of whose hills thou mayest digbrass.\n10. When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless theLordthy God for the good land which he hath given thee.\n11. Beware that thouforgetnot theLordthy God, in not keeping his commandments, and hisjudgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:\n12. Lestwhenthou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelttherein;\n13. Andwhenthy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;\n14. Then thineheartbelifted up, and thouforgettheLordthy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;\n15. Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness,wherein werefieryserpents, and scorpions, anddrought, wherethere wasno water; who brought thee forthwaterout of the rock of flint;\n16. Who fed thee in the wilderness withmanna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he mightprovethee, to do thee good at thy latter end;\n17. And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might ofminehand hath gotten me this wealth.\n18. But thou shalt remember theLordthy God: forit ishe that giveth thee power to getwealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, asit isthis day.\n19. And it shall be, if thou do at all forget theLordthy God, andwalkafter othergods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surelyperish.\n20.
