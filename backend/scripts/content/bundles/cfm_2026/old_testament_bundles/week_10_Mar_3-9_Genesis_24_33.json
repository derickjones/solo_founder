You might say that the account of Jacob, grandson of Abraham and Sarah, is the story of a man who learned the answer to that question. In a culture where the firstborn son received a birthright blessing, Jacob was born second, grasping the heel of his twin brother, Esau. The name “Jacob” means “supplanter”—one who replaces someone else. Jacob lived up to that name by trying, more than once, to supplant Esau as inheritor of the birthright blessing because Esau was unworthy of it (see\nGenesis 25:30–34\n;\n26:34–35\n;\n27:36\n). The result was discord in the family, and Jacob had to flee for his life into the wilderness.\nYears later, God commanded Jacob to return home. On the way, Jacob, in humility, again sought a blessing from God. The scriptures describe this time as a “wrestle” for Jacob, and he declared that he would not give up “except thou bless me” (\nGenesis 32:26\n). Then came the lesson—and the blessing. God changed Jacob’s name to Israel—meaning, among other things, “let God prevail.” Israel learned that to receive God’s most valuable blessings, His covenant blessings, it’s not necessary to supplant someone else. His blessings aren’t purchased or seized or won. He gives them freely to all who live up to the name of Israel—who let God prevail in their lives.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 24\nCovenant marriage is essential to God’s eternal plan.\nWhile reading\nGenesis 24\n, ask yourself why Abraham considered the marriage of his son Isaac to be so important. Why is marriage important to God?\nWhat qualities do you find in Rebekah that would contribute to a strong marriage and family? (see especially\nverses 15–28, 57–61\n).\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nMarriage\n,” Gospel Library.\nGenesis 25:29–34\nI can value eternal things over temporal things.\nIn Isaac and Rebekah’s culture, the oldest son received the birthright, which meant a greater inheritance, along with greater responsibilities for caring for the family. As you read\nGenesis 25:29–34\n, ponder why Esau might have been willing to give up his birthright in exchange for a meal. What lessons do you find for yourself in this account? It might help to make two lists: (1) eternal blessings God wants to give you and (2) worldly things that might distract you. Then you could read the passage, replacing “birthright” with something from the first list and “pottage” with something from the second. How will you focus on the Savior and the eternal blessings of His gospel?\nSee also\nMatthew 6:19–33\n; M. Russell Ballard, “\nRemember What Matters Most\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 105–7.\nJacob at Bethel\n, by James Smetham\nGenesis 28\nThe covenants of the Lord’s house bring God’s power into my life.\nWhile sleeping on a pillow of stones, Jacob had a life-changing dream. It was such a sacred experience that Jacob named the place Bethel, or “house of God,” declaring, “Surely the Lord is in this place” (\nGenesis 28:16\n).\nAs you read\nGenesis 28\n, you might ask yourself what made this experience so sacred to Jacob. What was he going through at the time? How might he have been feeling? You could also look for words and phrases in\nverses 10–22\nthat remind you of the house of the Lord. What impressions do you receive about God, His house, and His covenants?\nAt the end of this outline is a painting that depicts Jacob’s dream; you might refer to it as you read. If you were to create your own artistic depiction of his dream, what would you do? What truths from the story would you try to portray?\nThe hymn “\nNearer, My God, to Thee\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 100) is based on Jacob’s experience. What connections do you see between this song and\nGenesis 28:10–22\n? How does the temple help you feel nearer to God? Consider looking for answers to this question in President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nThe Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 93–96). You may also want to review the covenants and blessings of the house of the Lord in\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n27.2\n(Gospel Library). How does keeping these covenants bring God’s power into your life?\nBe creative.\nThere are many ways to learn from the scriptures besides just reading them. Some people find that they understand the scriptures better if they draw pictures of the accounts. Others find spiritual insights in sacred music related to the scriptures. Don’t limit yourself to one way of learning; be open to trying a variety of approaches.\nGenesis 29:31–35\n;\n30:1–24\nThe Lord remembers me in my trials.\nAs you read\nGenesis 29:31–35\nand\n30:1–24\n, look for words describing God’s mercy to Rachel and Leah. Ponder how God has “looked upon [your] affliction” and “remembered” you (\nGenesis 29:32\n;\n30:22\n).\nGenesis 32–33\nThe Savior can heal my family.\nAs Jacob returned to Canaan, he was “greatly afraid and distressed” about how his brother, Esau, would receive him (\nGenesis 32:7\n). As you read\nGenesis 32–33\n, ponder your own family relationships—perhaps especially one that needs healing. Maybe this story could inspire you to reach out to someone. Questions like these could guide your reading:\nHow did Jacob prepare to meet Esau?\nWhat stands out to you about Jacob’s prayer found in\nGenesis 32:9–12\n?\nWhat do you learn about forgiveness from Esau’s example?\nHow can the Savior help us heal family relationships?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhy did Abraham not want Isaac to marry a Canaanite?\nWhy did Jacob pretend to be Esau?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 24:10–21\nI can be kind to others.\nTo highlight Rebekah’s impressive example of kindness, you could show your children the picture below or this week’s activity page as you summarize the story in\nGenesis 24:10–21\n. Your children might enjoy acting out the story. This could lead to a conversation about acts of kindness you and your children have seen.\nConsider singing a song about kindness together, such as “\nKindness Begins with Me\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 145). Your children could listen for the word “kindness” (or a similar word) and stand when they hear it.

Maybe your children could pretend to climb a ladder, and with each step, talk about times when we promise to obey God, such as when we are baptized, take the sacrament, or go to the temple. How do our covenants bring us closer to God?\nGenesis 32:6–11\n;\n33:1–4\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ can help me love my family.\nTo introduce these verses, you might explain that after many years of hard feelings, Jacob was going to meet Esau again.

We can likewise rely on the Lord and trust that He can help us prepare for and someday obtain the blessings of eternal marriage. This lesson can help students understand the importance of eternal, covenant marriage in Heavenly Father’s plan. Student preparation: Invite students to write a question they or someone they know might have about temple marriage and come to class prayerfully seeking answers to that question. Possible Learning Activities Temple marriage As marriage can be difficult for some students to discuss, prayerfully ponder ways to prepare and teach this topic with sensitivity and love. To prepare students to discuss the topic of marriage, consider displaying the picture at the beginning of the lesson, along with the following scenario. Imagine a friend says: “Is it really that important to be married in the temple? I have a hard time seeing myself getting married there anyway; it feels out of reach for me. I just want to find someone I love.” What are some assumptions your friend might have about temple marriage? What truths might your friend not understand about God and temple marriage? Invite students to answer the following questions in their study journals. How do you personally feel about temple marriage? What questions or concerns do you have about temple marriage? As you study Genesis 24 , invite the Spirit to help you understand the importance of temple marriage. Seek insight on how the Lord can help you receive an eternal, temple marriage. An important journey To help students better understand the context of Genesis 24 , invite them to view the following map. If they have access to the Latter-day Saint edition of the King James Bible, they can find it as map 9, “The World of the Old Testament,” in the Bible Maps section. Read or summarize the following paragraph, and invite students to find the places you mention on the map. If needed, show students where Canaan (number 13) and Haran (number 8) are located. Abraham and his family lived in Canaan among people who worshipped idols and engaged in other sinful practices. Abraham had relatives that lived in Haran, where Abraham previously lived. Before reading the following verses, explain that the Joseph Smith Translation changes the word “thigh” to “hand” in verses 2 and 9 . This means that Abraham and his servant entered into an agreement. Read Genesis 24:1–4, 7–9 , looking for instructions Abraham gave his servant regarding his son Isaac. What was Abraham’s servant instructed to do? What do you see in verse 7 that shows the Lord cared about whom Isaac married? Have students use the scale on the map to determine how many miles or kilometers this journey would be. Help students see that Abraham asked his servant to travel nearly 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) round trip to find a wife for Isaac. Why do you think it was worth such sacrifice that Isaac not marry one of the Canaanite daughters? As needed, explain that when God established His covenant with Abraham and Sarah, He said that Abraham’s posterity would only keep this important covenant with Him if they married according to His law. They would need to enter into “the new and everlasting covenant of marriage” (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4 ). Today, we enter into this covenant when we are married in the Lord’s holy temples. There was no one in the land of Canaan whom Isaac could marry in the covenant. The covenant could only be preserved with someone from Abraham’s family in Haran. The Lord’s help Display the following image, and invite students to share what they know about the account pictured. You could read or summarize the following paragraph if needed. Abraham’s servant traveled the long distance to Haran to find a wife for Isaac. While waiting by a well, he prayed and asked God for the ability to know whom the Lord would have him find. You could invite students to read the following verses individually, in pairs, or as a class. For the below activity, it may be helpful to explain that the name “Jehovah” in the King James Version of the Bible is generally indicated by LORD in all capital letters. The words “Lord” or “lord”, on the other hand, may simply refer to someone holding power, authority, or influence, such as a master or ruler. (See Bible Dictionary, “ Jehovah ”) Read Genesis 24:12–27 , looking for how the Lord helped Abraham’s servant find a wife for Isaac. It may be helpful to mark when you see the word LORD when every letter is capitalized. What did you find? Consider summarizing the rest of Genesis 24 by sharing the following paragraph. Abraham’s servant met Rebekah’s brother and father. He explained who he was and how the Lord had helped him find Rebekah. The following day, Rebekah courageously chose to return with the servant and be sealed to Isaac in the covenant of eternal marriage (see Genesis 24:29–67 ). What do you learn about the Lord through the account of Isaac and Rebekah and their eternal marriage? Students may respond with a variety of truths, but be sure they understand that the Lord will help us as we strive to enter into the covenant of eternal marriage . How can the Lord help someone who is striving for an eternal marriage but worries they may never receive this blessing? Why do you think eternal marriage is so important to the Lord? Why eternal marriage? To help students better understand the importance of eternal marriage, invite them to draw in their study journals a simple image of a temple, such as the one below. Underneath your temple drawing, write a question that could help you better understand the truths you’ve learned today. This could be your own question, a question from someone you know, or one of the following: Why is eternal marriage important? What blessings can I obtain by being married in the temple and then striving to honor those covenants? How can the Lord help me someday obtain the blessings of eternal marriage? Invite students to take 5–8 minutes to complete the following activity individually or with partners. You could invite them to list in their study journals answers that they find. Help students understand that they might not find clear answers to their questions; however, the effort to ask questions and seek understanding is an important part of acting with faith in God. Distribute the handout titled “Eternal Marriage” to students who would like to study it. To help you respond to your question, search various Church resources, such as the following: Doctrinal mastery passages ( Genesis 2:24 ; 1 Corinthians 11:11 ; Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4 ) The handout titled “Eternal Marriage” “Marriage” and related entries in the Topical Guide, Guide to the Scriptures, or Topics and Questions in the Gospel Library Phrases such as “covenant marriage” or “temple marriage” in the Gospel Library search Open PDF Invite students to share with the class what they learned. Personal reflection Reflect on the scenario from the beginning of class. In your study journal, answer the following questions: How would you respond to your friend’s question about why temple marriage is important? What did you learn today about Heavenly Father or Jesus Christ that could give you hope in your efforts to invite the blessings of temple marriage? Invite willing students to share what they wrote. Consider sharing your testimony of the importance of covenant marriage, and encourage your students to begin now to prepare for it.\n\n\n--- Lesson 30 ---\nWith the birth of their twins Jacob and Esau, the covenant promise of posterity for Rebekah and Isaac was at last realized. Esau, as the elder twin, would have been entitled to the birthright promises given to the firstborn son. Tragically, Esau did not prioritize his eternal blessings, instead seeking to satisfy his worldly desires. This lesson can help students value the Lord’s eternal blessings over worldly desires. Student preparation: Encourage students to prayerfully evaluate the balance in their lives between the things of God (e.g., prayer, scripture study, church activity) and the things of the world. Invite them to identify any worldly distractions that may be taking priority over eternal things. Possible Learning Activities Valuing the things of God To help students think about how immediate needs or wants can sometimes affect long-term goals, draw the following chart on the board: Now Future Now Future Invite a few students to share a goal they have for their future. List these on the board in the second column. Select one of the goals in the second column. Invite students to think about immediate needs or wants that, if acted upon, could prevent someone from achieving that goal. Give students an opportunity to share a few different ideas. Discuss how choices we make now can affect our future goals and maybe even prevent us from achieving them. When students have finished, explain that this concept can also apply to our efforts to seek God’s eternal blessings. Invite students to complete the following self-assessment in their study journals. Prayerfully reflect on the following statements. Record in your journal how much each statement applies to you, using the answers “definitely,” “mostly,” “a little,” and “not at all.” I am willing to sacrifice earthly desires for eternal blessings. I understand why the Lord asks me to value His eternal blessings over things I want now. I recognize the blessings that come when I prioritize Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ over the things of the world. As you study today, invite the Holy Ghost to help you see the value of eternal blessings. Seek inspiration about how to prioritize eternal blessings over earthly desires. Birthright inheritance and blessing To help students understand the cultural significance of the decisions Esau and Jacob made, summarize the following paragraphs in your own words. In Old Testament times, the oldest son typically received the birthright. The birthright inheritance included a double portion of land and wealth. It also included greater responsibility to care for the mother and the rest of the family following the death of the father. In addition to the temporal inheritance, the father would give a birthright blessing to confer priesthood authority upon the oldest son. This blessing established the son’s position in the family as teacher and leader. Rebekah and Isaac prayed for the blessing of a righteous posterity for many years. Eventually, they were blessed with twin boys, Esau and Jacob. Because Esau was born first, he would have been the birthright son. However, the Lord had revealed to Rebekah that Jacob was to be the birthright son ( Genesis 25:22–23 ). Read Genesis 25:27–34 , looking for how Esau demonstrated that he did not value his birthright blessing. (To “sod pottage” means to cook soup or stew.) What did you find? Read Genesis 26:34–35 , looking for Esau’s decision and his parents feelings about his marriage choices. (Hittites were Canaanites who worshipped false gods.) Why were Rebekah and Isaac grieved by Esau’s decision? If students are not sure how to respond to the previous question, you might explain that the Canaanites worshipped idols and engaged in other sinful practices. Marrying Canaanite women meant that Esau turned away from the covenant God made with Abraham and his posterity. The blessings of valuing the things of God To help students understand the story of Jacob and Esau, the following paragraph could be read or summarized. Or you could share the video “ Jacob and Esau ” (2:06), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 2:5 Despite Esau’s bad choices, Isaac in his old age summoned Esau to give him the birthright blessing. Before Esau arrived, Rebekah disguised Jacob as his brother. Thinking Jacob was Esau, Isaac blessed Jacob with the birthright blessing (see Genesis 27:1–29 ). “After Isaac acknowledged that he had blessed Jacob instead of Esau, he affirmed that Jacob ‘shall be blessed’ ( Genesis 27:33 )—suggesting that God’s will had been accomplished” ( Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: Old Testament 2022 , 39). Read Genesis 27:34, 38 , looking for Esau’s reaction when he learned that Isaac had given the birthright blessing to Jacob. What stands out to you? How would you summarize what we learn from this story as a statement of truth? Use students’ words to identify a truth similar to the following: Choosing immediate or worldly desires over God’s eternal blessings can lead to sorrow and regret. There are a lot of possible answers to the following question. Encouraging several students to share their answers can help students feel safe to share different ideas and perspectives. Why can it sometimes be challenging to prioritize things that have eternal value? Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained: In the busyness of our daily lives and in the commotion of the contemporary world in which we live, we may be distracted from the eternal things that matter the most by making pleasure, prosperity, popularity, and prominence our primary priorities. Our short-term preoccupation with “the things of this world” and “the honors of men” may lead us to forfeit our spiritual birthright for far less than a mess of pottage. … Each of us should evaluate our temporal and spiritual priorities sincerely and prayerfully to identify the things in our lives that may impede the bounteous blessings that Heavenly Father and the Savior are willing to bestow upon us. (“ Put On Thy Strength, O Zion ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 94) Have students share what they liked or learned from Elder Bednar’s statement. Then invite them to do the following three things individually or in small groups: Create a scenario where someone your age may be tempted to “forfeit our spiritual birthright for far less than a mess of pottage.” Think of an example of how the Savior prioritized His Father’s will over immediate or worldly desires. (For example, see Matthew 4:2–10 or Luke 22:41–42 .) Think of a modern-day example of someone prioritizing God’s will over immediate or worldly desires. Ask students to share their ideas. As students share, you could point out that attending seminary today is a good example of putting God first. You could show the video “ No Regrets ” (5:38) from ChurchofJesusChrist.org . A young man chose to attend seminary over surfing. Encourage students to look for the blessings he received because of this choice. 5:39 What blessings can we receive, now and in the future, for choosing the things of God over the things of the world? How did the Savior place eternal blessings above immediate desires? Make a plan Invite students to complete the following activity in their study journals. List your top five priorities in order of most to least important. As you review this list, note any adjustments the Holy Ghost impresses you to make. Below this list, record any other thoughts you have after doing this activity. Can you identify a clear next step for you to prioritize the things of God more than the things of the world? If so, write this somewhere you will see it regularly. To conclude class, you could share your witness of blessings you have received as you have valued the things of God over the things of the world.\n\n\n--- Lesson 31 ---\nAfter his life was threatened by his brother Esau, Jacob was directed by his parents to travel to his mother’s homeland to find a wife. While journeying, he had a vision that led him to enter into the Abrahamic covenant with God. This lesson can help students feel an increased desire to make covenants with God in the temple. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to review the promises of the Abrahamic covenant ( Abraham 2:8–11 ). Students could be encouraged to try and explain to a member of their family about the Abrahamic covenant and why it is important to them. Possible Learning Activities Why covenants? You could begin class by displaying a picture of a temple and singing the Primary song “ I Love to See the Temple ” ( Children’s Songbook , 95). Then display the following prompt. Invite students to select the statement that is most true of them. Alternatively, you could share only the first part of the prompt, and students could finish the statement in a sentence or two that accurately reflects their feelings and thoughts. When I think about going to the temple in the future to make covenants with God, I: Don’t know what to think. I don’t think about it very much. Get excited. I really look forward to that day. Am a little nervous. I don’t know what to expect. Don’t see much of a point to it. Give students time to write their responses. Invite them to seek inspiration from the Holy Ghost during the lesson. The Holy Ghost can help them appreciate the importance of making covenants with God. Jacob’s dream Invite students to write the following incomplete truth in their study journals. You could also write it on the board and add to it throughout the lesson. In this lesson, you will study about Jacob in Genesis 28 . In Genesis 28:3–4, 12–20 , God established a covenant with Jacob, which Jacob accepted. From this account, we can learn important lessons about the value of making covenants with God. As you study this lesson, look for ways to complete this truth: As we make and keep covenants with God, He will … Ask students to share what they remember about the covenant the Lord made with Abraham. For specific details on this covenant, see Lesson 23 : “ Genesis 12, 17 .” After students share, summarize the following paragraph in your own words. Although Jacob was Abraham’s grandson, he may have felt like the blessings of Abraham’s covenant were out of reach for him. Jacob had not yet married in the covenant. Also, conflict over the birthright and blessing had led Esau to want to take Jacob’s life ( Genesis 27:41 ). To protect Jacob and ensure he had the opportunity to marry in the covenant, Jacob’s parents instructed him to leave home and journey several hundred miles to his mother’s homeland (see Genesis 27:42–46 ; 28:1–2 ). This journey would take Jacob far away from Canaan, the land the birthright promised him. Read Genesis 28:10–15 , looking for what Jacob experienced one night during his journey. Consider inviting students to draw a picture of what Jacob saw in his dream. Students could share their drawings with a partner and explain what stood out to them from the verses. You might then display the following image as one depiction of the vision. What promises from the Abrahamic covenant did the Lord offer Jacob in these verses? What additional promises did the Lord give Jacob in verse 15 ? You could invite students to add these additional promises to their truth. You might list possible responses on the board. Responses might include be with us, protect and care for us , not leave us . Why do you think these promises might have been particularly meaningful to Jacob at this time? To help students better understand these promises, invite them to complete the following activity in pairs or small groups. You might want to encourage students to look for additional scriptures or statements that confirm these promises. Study the following scriptures and statement, looking for how they deepen your understanding of the promises the Lord made to Jacob. John 14:18 Acts 17:27 (note the Joseph Smith Translation) Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said: As you walk the covenant path, from baptism to the temple and throughout life, I promise you power to go against the natural worldly flow—power to learn, power to repent and be sanctified, and power to find hope, comfort, and even joy as you face life’s challenges. I promise you and your family protection against the influence of the adversary, especially when you make the temple a major focus in your life. (“ Accessing God’s Power through Covenants ,” Liahona , May 2023, 37) It might be helpful for students to understand that making covenants does not spare us from challenges in life. However, Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught that these covenants do provide “our greatest hope for avoiding avoidable misery on the one hand and successfully dealing with the unavoidable woes of life on the other” (“ Why the Covenant Path ,” Liahona , May 2021, 117). Which of these promises are most meaningful to you? Jacob’s feelings about his experience It might be helpful to display the following passage and questions. Invite students to read and discuss in pairs or small groups. (Consider sharing with students that the words “afraid” and “dreadful” show that Jacob was in awe. “Dreadful” is better translated as “awe-inspiring.”) Read Genesis 28:16–21 , looking for Jacob’s reaction to his experience. What feelings about the Lord do you see Jacob expressing? How might these feelings motivate him to make a covenant with the Lord? After students have had time to discuss, you could invite a few to share with the class what they learned. Providing opportunities for students to share with each other what they are learning can increase their confidence in participating in gospel conversations. For additional training on how to encourage students to share with others, see “ Encourage learners to share the truths they are learning ” in Teacher Development Skills. (Teaching in the Savior’s Way [2022], 35) What words or phrases from verses 16–21 could relate to modern-day temples? Students might point out words or phrases like “surely the Lord is in this place” ( verse 16 ); “the house of God” and “the gate of heaven” ( verse 17 ); “Beth-el” ( verse 19 ), which means “house of God” (see footnote 19a); and “vowed a vow” ( verse 20 ). You might want to invite students to mark these phrases in their scriptures. Students could add to their drawings of the vision by writing “house of God,” “gate of heaven,” or “temple” somewhere near the bottom of the ladder. Making covenants with the Lord Invite students to do the following activity in their study journals. It might be helpful to tell students that they will reflect on these responses in a future lesson. Students will use what they write here to complete an assessment activity in Lesson 37: “ Assess Your Learning 2 .” To prepare students to write their responses, you might want to share the following paragraph in your own words. As Jacob left his parents’ home and set out on his own, he made covenants with God. God promised to be with, care for, and protect Jacob. In a few short years, you will face many choices about what to do next in your life. Among these decisions will be the opportunity to make covenants with God in the temple. Think about this time in your future as you respond to the following questions in your study journal: What promised blessings have you experienced from striving to keep your covenants with God or by serving in the temple? What situations might you face in the future where you would benefit from the care and protection God promises to people who make covenants with Him? Consider sharing your testimony of how you have experienced the promises associated with making and keeping covenants with the Lord.\n\n\n--- Lesson 32 ---\nThe prophet Jacob is an example of letting God prevail in his life. He went to great effort to marry in the covenant, gain the Lord’s blessings in his day-to-day work, and do what God asked him to do to heal his family relationships. This lesson can help students increase their willingness to let God prevail in their lives. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to list ways God is an influence in their lives. If students would like to learn more on this subject, they can listen, watch, or read portions of President Russell M. Nelson’s talk, “ Let God Prevail ” (18:51). Videos: “ Let God Prevail ” (18:51) from time code 12:18 to 13:02, “ Jacob and His Family ” (3:00) Possible Learning Activities The influences in our lives Consider inviting students to make a list in their study journal of some of the influences in their lives. They might include friends, teachers, counselors, media personalities, parents, prophets, the Lord, and even their own thoughts and ambitions. Then invite them to thoughtfully rank the influence each item on the list has. Students could put a number 1 by the strongest influence in their life, then a number 2, and so forth. Or students could write words like “high,” “medium,” or “low” to indicate the amount of influence for each item. Before they read the following statement, it may be useful to explain that letting God prevail is allowing Him to be the greatest influence in our lives. Read the following inspired questions by President Russell M. Nelson. Ponder how you would answer them. 18:52 Are you willing to let God prevail in your life? Are you willing to let God be the most important influence in your life? Will you allow His words, His commandments, and His covenants to influence what you do each day? Will you allow His voice to take priority over any other? Are you willing to let whatever He needs you to do take precedence over every other ambition? Are you willing to have your will swallowed up in His? (“ Let God Prevail ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 94). Invite students to write their responses to these questions in their study journal. These could include ways they are willing to let God prevail or be the greatest influence in their lives. They can also include ways they are not willing and why it is difficult for them. Seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to give you insights and help with any of your concerns or difficulties, and to help you feel an increased desire to let Him prevail more in your life. Jacob’s example On one occasion, Jacob was “greatly afraid and distressed” ( Genesis 32:7 ), worried for his and his family’s safety. He “wrestled” ( Genesis 32:25 ) all night, determined to obtain the Lord’s blessings for the difficult situation he faced. (You will study more of this situation later in the lesson.) In response, the Lord promised to help Jacob, but He also changed Jacob’s name. Read Genesis 32:28 and mark what the Lord changed Jacob’s name to and why. Consider inviting students to note in their scriptures that one of the meanings of the name Israel is “Let God prevail” (footnote 28b, see Bible Dictionary, “ Israel ”) This lesson highlights three areas of Jacob’s, or Israel’s, life in which he let God prevail. As you study, look for examples of the following principle: As we are willing to let God prevail in our lives, He will bless us in all things. Prepare copies of the following handouts and do one of the following: Give these handouts to three students or groups of students ahead of time and invite them to lead the class through the material. Invite students to complete all three activities in small groups. Give students a basic overview of the three handouts and allow students to select one or two to study. One way to provide an overview is to watch “ Jacob and His Family ” (3:00). 3:0 Open PDF Open PDF Open PDF If students studied these three sections in groups, invite them to share what they learned and how it may be meaningful to them. If they do not naturally mention it, ask what they learned about the Lord. Consider asking students to share other examples they have seen of people who let God prevail in their lives. Letting God prevail in your life Take a moment to ponder what you learned or want to remember from this lesson. Seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost as you add your thoughts to your journal entry from the beginning of the lesson. Include reasons why you may want to let God prevail in your life. You may also include what you feel you could do to increase your desire to let God prevail in your life. If they are not too personal, invite students to share their thoughts. Consider sharing your own thoughts and testimony as well.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 24 ---\n1. And Abraham was old,andwellstricken in age: and theLordhadblessedAbraham in allthings.\n2. And Abraham said unto his eldestservantof his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under mythigh:\n3. And I will make theeswearby theLord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shaltnottake awifeunto my son of the daughters of theCanaanites, among whom I dwell:\n4. But thou shalt go unto mycountry, and to mykindred, and take wife unto my son Isaac.\n5. And the servant said unto him,Peradventurethe woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?\n6. And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.\n7. TheLordGodof heaven, which took me from myfathershouse, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give thisland; he shall send hisangelbefore thee, and thou shalt take wife unto my son from thence.\n8. And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.\n9. And the servant put his hand under thethighof Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.\n10. And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his masterwerein his hand: and he arose, and went toMesopotamia, unto the city ofNahor.\n11. And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by well of water at the time of the evening,eventhe time that women go out to drawwater.\n12. And he said, OLordGodof my master Abraham, I pray thee,sendme good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.\n13. Behold, I standhereby the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to drawwater:\n14. And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also:let the same beshethatthou hastappointedfor thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.\n15. And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born toBethuel, son ofMilcah, the wife of Nahor, Abrahams brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\n16. And the damselwasveryfairto look upon, virgin, neither had any manknown her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.\n17. And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink little water of thy pitcher.\n18. And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.\n19. And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will drawwaterfor thy camels also, until they have done drinking.\n20. And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to drawwater,and drew for all his camels.\n21. And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether theLordhad made his journeyprosperousor not.\n22. And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took goldenearringof half shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of tenshekelsweight of gold;\n23. And said, Whose daughterartthou? tell me, I pray thee: is there roominthy fathers house for us to lodge in?\n24. And she said unto him, Iamthe daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare untoNahor.\n25. She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.\n26. And the manboweddown his head, and worshipped theLord.\n27. And he said, BlessedbetheLordGodof my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of hismercyand his truth: Ibeingin the way, theLordledme to the house of my masters brethren.\n28. And the damsel ran, and toldthem ofher mothers house these things.\n29. And Rebekah had brother, and his namewasLaban: andLabanran out unto the man, unto the well.\n30. And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sisters hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.\n31. And he said, Come in, thoublessedof theLord; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.\n32. And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw andprovenderfor the camels, and water towashhis feet, and the mens feet thatwerewith him.\n33. And there was setmeatbeforehim to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.\n34. And he said, IamAbrahams servant.\n35. And theLordhathblessedmy master greatly; and he is becomegreat: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.\n36. And Sarah my masters wife bare asonto my master when she wasold: and unto him hath hegivenall that he hath.\n37. And my master made meswear, saying, Thou shalt not take wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:\n38. But thou shalt go unto myfathershouse, and to my kindred, and take wife unto my son.\n39. And I said unto my master,Peradventurethe woman will not follow me.\n40. And he said unto me, TheLord, before whom Iwalk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take wife for my son of my kindred, and of my fathers house:\n41. Then shalt thou be clear fromthismy oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not theeone,thou shalt be clear from my oath.\n42. And I came this day unto the well, and said, OLordGod of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:\n43. Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to drawwater,and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, little water of thy pitcher to drink;\n44. And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels:letthe samebethe woman whom theLordhathappointedout for my masters son.\n45. And before I had done speaking in mineheart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drewwater:and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.\n46. And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from hershoulder,and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.\n47. And I asked her, and said, Whose daughterartthou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahors son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put theearring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.\n48. And Iboweddown my head, and worshipped theLord, and blessed theLordGod of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my masters brothersdaughterunto his son.\n49. And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.\n50. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from theLord: we cannotspeakunto thee bad or good.\n51. Behold, Rebekahisbefore thee, takeher,and go, and let her be thy masters sonswife, as theLordhath spoken.\n52. And it came to pass, that, when Abrahams servant heard their words, he worshipped theLord,bowing himselfto the earth.\n53. And the servant brought forthjewelsof silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gavethemto Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.\n54. And they did eat and drink, he and the men thatwerewith him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.\n55. And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with usa fewdays, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\n56. And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing theLordhathprosperedmy way; send me away that I may go to my master.\n57. And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.\n58. And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.\n59. And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and hernurse, and Abrahams servant, and his men.\n60. And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thouartour sister, be thouthemotherof thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess thegateof those whichhatethem.\n61. And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.\n62. And Isaac came from the way of thewellLahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.\n63. And Isaac went out tomeditatein the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camelswerecoming.\n64. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac,she lighted offthe camel.\n65. For shehadsaid unto the servant, What manisthis that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servanthadsaid, Itismy master: therefore she took veil, and covered herself.\n66. And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.\n67. And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarahs tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac wascomfortedafter his mothersdeath.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 25 ---\n1. Then again Abraham took wife, and her namewasKeturah.\n2. And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, andMedan, andMidian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.\n3. And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.\n4. And the sons ofMidian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All thesewerethe children ofKeturah.\n5. AndAbrahamgaveall that he had unto Isaac.\n6. But unto the sons of theconcubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, andsentthem away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto theeastcountry.\n7. And thesearethedaysof the years ofAbrahamslife which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.\n8. Then Abraham gave up theghost, and died in goodoldage, an old man, and fullof years;and wasgatheredto his people.\n9. And his sons Isaac and Ishmaelburiedhim in the cave ofMachpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, whichisbefore Mamre;\n10. The field which Abrahampurchasedof the sons of Heth: there was Abrahamburied, and Sarah his wife.\n11. And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by thewellLahai-roi.\n12. Now thesearethegenerationsof Ishmael, Abrahams son, whomHagarthe Egyptian, Sarahs handmaid,bareunto Abraham:\n13. And thesearethe names of the sons ofIshmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,\n14. And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,\n15. Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:\n16. Thesearethe sons of Ishmael, and thesearetheir names, by their towns, and by their castles;twelveprinces according to their nations.\n17. And thesearethe years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.\n18. And they dwelt fromHavilahuntoShur, thatisbefore Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria:andhe died in the presence of all his brethren.\n19. And thesearethe generations of Isaac, Abrahams son:Abrahambegat Isaac:\n20. And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter ofBethuelthe Syrian ofPadan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.\n21. And Isaac entreated theLordfor hiswife, because shewasbarren: and theLordwasentreatedof him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.\n22. And the children struggled together within her; and she said, Ifit beso, whyamI thus? And she went toinquireof theLord.\n23. And theLordsaid unto her,Twonationsarein thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; andthe onepeople shall be stronger thanthe otherpeople; and theeldershall serve the younger.\n24. And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,there weretwins in her womb.\n25. And the first came out red, all over like anhairygarment; and they called his nameEsau.\n26. And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esausheel; and hisnamewas calledJacob: and Isaacwasthreescore years old when she bare them.\n27. And the boys grew: and Esau was cunninghunter, man of the field; and Jacobwasaplainman, dwelling intents.\n28. And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat ofhisvenison: butRebekahloved Jacob.\n29. And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and hewasfaint:\n30. And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same redpottage;for Iamfaint: therefore was his name calledEdom.\n31. And Jacob said, Sell me this day thybirthright.\n32. And Esau said, Behold, Iamat the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?\n33. And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.\n34. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despisedhisbirthright.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 26 ---\n1. And there was afaminein the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went untoAbimelechking of thePhilistinesunto Gerar.\n2. And theLordappeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:\n3. Sojournin this land, and I will be with thee, and willblessthee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all thesecountries, and I will perform theoathwhich I sware unto Abraham thy father;\n4. And I will make thyseedto multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all thenationsof the earth be blessed;\n5. Because that Abrahamobeyedmy voice, and kept mycharge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\n6. And Isaac dwelt inGerar:\n7. And the men of the place askedhimof his wife; and he said, Sheismysister: for he feared to say,She ismy wife; lest,said he,the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because shewasfairto look upon.\n8. And it came to pass, when he had been there long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at window, and saw, and, behold, Isaacwassporting with Rebekah his wife.\n9. And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of surety sheisthy wife: and how saidst thou, Sheismy sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.\n10. AndAbimelechsaid, Whatisthis thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly havelienwith thy wife, and thou shouldest havebroughtguiltiness upon us.\n11. And Abimelech charged allhispeople, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\n12. Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year anhundredfold: and theLordblessedhim.\n13. Andthe man waxedgreat, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:\n14. For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistinesenviedhim.\n15. For all thewellswhich his fathers servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistineshadstopped them, and filled them with earth.\n16. And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art muchmightierthan we.\n17. And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.\n18. And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called theirnamesafter the names by which his father had called them.\n19. And Isaacs servants digged in the valley, and found there well of springing water.\n20. And the herdmen of Gerar didstrivewith Isaacs herdmen, saying, The waterisours: and he called the name of the wellEsek; because they strove with him.\n21. And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of itSitnah.\n22. And heremovedfrom thence, and digged another well; and for that theystrovenot: and he called the name of itRehoboth; and he said, For now theLordhath made room for us, and we shall befruitfulin the land.\n23. And he went up from thence toBeer-sheba.\n24. And theLordappeared unto him the same night, and said, Iamthe God of Abraham thy father:fear not, forIamwith thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thyseedfor my servant Abrahams sake.\n25. And he builded analtarthere, and called upon thenameof theLord, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaacs servants digged well.\n26. Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, andPhicholthe chief captain of his army.\n27. And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing yehateme, and have sent me away from you?\n28. And they said, We saw certainly that theLordwas with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us,evenbetwixt us and thee, and let us make covenant with thee;\n29. That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away inpeace: thouartnow theblessedof theLord.\n30. And he made them feast, and they did eat and drink.\n31. And theyrose up betimesin the morning, andswareone to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.\n32. And it came to pass the same day, that Isaacs servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.\n33. And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the cityisBeer-shebaunto this day.\n34. And Esau was forty years old when he took towifeJudith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:\n35. Which were agrief of mindunto Isaac and to Rebekah.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 27 ---\n1. And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes weredim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,here amI.\n2. And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:\n3. Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thyquiverand thy bow, and go out to the field, andtakemesomevenison;\n4. And make mesavourymeat, such as I love, and bringitto me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.\n5. And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to huntforvenison,andto bringit.\n6. AndRebekahspake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,\n7. Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before theLordbefore my death.\n8. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.\n9. Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:\n10. And thou shalt bringitto thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.\n11. And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brotherisahairyman, and Iama smooth man:\n12. My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as deceiver; and I shall bring curse upon me, and not blessing.\n13. And his mother said unto him, Upon mebethy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch methem.\n14. And he went, and fetched, and broughtthemto his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.\n15. And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, whichwerewith her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:\n16. And she put theskinsof the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:\n17. And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n18. And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, HereamI; whoartthou, my son?\n19. And Jacob said unto his father, IamEsau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n20. And Isaac said unto his son, Howis itthat thou hast founditso quickly, my son? And he said, Because theLordthy God broughtitto me.\n21. And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thoubemy very son Esau or not.\n22. And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voiceisJacobs voice, but the handsarethe hands of Esau.\n23. And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esaus hands: so he blessed him.\n24. And he said,Artthou my very son Esau? And he said, Iam.\n25. And he said, Bringitnear to me, and I will eat of my sons venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he broughtitnear to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.\n26. And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.\n27. And he camenear, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, andblessedhim, and said, See, the smell of my sonisas the smell of field which theLordhath blessed:\n28. Therefore God give thee of thedewof heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:\n29. Let peopleservethee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mothers sonsbowdown to thee: cursedbeevery one that curseth thee, andblessedbehe thatblesseththee.\n30. And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\n31. And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his sons venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n32. And Isaac his father said unto him, Whoartthou? And he said, Iamthy son, thy firstborn Esau.\n33. And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? whereishe that hathtaken venison, and broughtitme, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and haveblessedhim? yea,andhe shall be blessed.\n34. And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,evenme also, O my father.\n35. And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.\n36. And he said, Is not he rightly namedJacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away mybirthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved blessing for me?\n37. And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him forservants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?\n38. And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me,evenme also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, andwept.\n39. And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;\n40. And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thybrother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shaltbreakhisyokefrom off thy neck.\n41. And Esau hated Jacob becauseof the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.\n42. And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself,purposingto kill thee.\n43. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise,fleethou to Laban mybrothertoHaran;\n44. And tarry with him few days, until thy brothers fury turn away;\n45. Until thy brothersangerturn away from thee, and he forgetthatwhich thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?\n46. And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of thedaughtersof Heth: if Jacob take wife of the daughters of Heth, such as thesewhich areof the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 28 ---\n1. And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take awifeof the daughters ofCanaan.\n2. Arise, go toPadan-aram, to the house ofBethuelthy mothers father; and take thee wife from thence of the daughters ofLabanthy mothers brother.\n3. And GodAlmightyblessthee, and make theefruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be amultitudeof people;\n4. And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thyseedwith thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.\n5. And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel theSyrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacobs and Esaus mother.\n6. When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him charge, saying, Thou shalt not take wife of the daughters of Canaan;\n7. And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;\n8. And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;\n9. Then went Esau untoIshmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abrahams son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be hiswife.\n10. And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.\n11. And he lighted upon certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and putthem forhis pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.\n12. And hedreamed, and behold aladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold theangelsof God ascending and descending on it.\n13. And, behold, theLordstoodabove it, and said, IamtheLordGodof Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: thelandwhereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;\n14. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to thenorth, and to the south: and in thee and in thyseedshall all thefamiliesof the earth beblessed.\n15. And, behold,Iamwith thee, and will keep thee in allplaceswhither thou goest, and willbringthee again into thisland; for I will not leave thee, until I have donethatwhich I have spoken to thee of.\n16. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely theLordis in this place; and I knewitnot.\n17. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadfulisthis place! thisisnone other but the house of God, and thisisthe gate ofheaven.\n18. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had putforhis pillows, and set it upforapillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.\n19. And he called the name of that placeBeth-el: but the name of that citywas calledLuzat the first.\n20. And Jacob vowed avow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,\n21. So that I come again to my fathers house in peace; then shall theLordbe my God:\n22. And this stone, which I have setfora pillar, shall be Gods house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give thetenthunto thee.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 29 ---\n1. Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.\n2. And he looked, and behold well in the field, and, lo, therewerethree flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and great stonewasupon the wells mouth.\n3. And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the wells mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the wells mouth in his place.\n4. And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whencebeye? And they said, OfHaranarewe.\n5. And he said unto them, Know yeLabanthe son of Nahor? And they said, We knowhim.\n6. And he said unto them,Ishe well? And they said,He iswell: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\n7. And he said, Lo,it isyet high day, neitheris ittime that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and goandfeedthem.\n8. And they said, We cannot, until allthe flocksbe gathered together, andtillthey roll the stone from the wells mouth; then we water the sheep.\n9. And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her fathers sheep: for she kept them.\n10. And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mothers brother, and the sheep of Laban his mothers brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the wells mouth, andwateredthe flock of Laban his mothers brother.\n11. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n12. And Jacob told Rachel that hewasher fathers brother, and that hewasRebekahs son: and she ran and told her father.\n13. And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sisters son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.\n14. And Laban said to him, Surely thouartmy bone and myflesh. And he abode with him the space of month.\n15. And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thouartmy brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, whatshallthy wagesbe?\n16. And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elderwasLeah, and the name of the youngerwasRachel.\n17. Leahwastender eyed; but Rachelwasbeautifuland wellfavoured.\n18. And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I willservethee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.\n19. And Laban said,It isbetter that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.\n20. And Jacob served seven years forRachel; and they seemed unto himbuta few days, for thelovehe had to her.\n21. And Jacob said unto Laban, Givememy wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.\n22. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made afeast.\n23. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.\n24. And Laban gave unto his daughter LeahZilpahhis maidforan handmaid.\n25. And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, itwasLeah: and he said to Laban, Whatisthis thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?\n26. And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before thefirstborn.\n27. Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n28. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.\n29. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughterBilhahhis handmaid to be her maid.\n30. And he went in also unto Rachel, and helovedalso Rachel more than Leah, andservedwith him yet seven other years.\n31. And when theLordsaw that Leahwashated, he opened her womb: but Rachelwasbarren.\n32. AndLeahconceived, and bare son, and she called his nameReuben: for she said, Surely theLordhath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.\n33. And she conceived again, and bare son; and said, Because theLordhath heard that Iwashated, he hath therefore given me thissonalso: and she called his nameSimeon.\n34. And she conceived again, and bare son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name calledLevi.\n35. And she conceived again, and bare son: and she said, Now will IpraisetheLord: therefore she called his nameJudah; and left bearing.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 30 ---\n1. And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachelenviedher sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.\n2. And Jacobs anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said,AmI inGodsstead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\n3. And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may alsohave children by her.\n4. And she gave himBilhahher handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.\n5. AndBilhahconceived, and bare Jacob son.\n6. And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me son: therefore called she his nameDan.\n7. And Bilhah Rachels maid conceived again, and bare Jacob second son.\n8. And Rachel said,Withgreat wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his nameNaphtali.\n9. When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.\n10. And Zilpah Leahs maid bare Jacob son.\n11. And Leah said, Atroopcometh: and she called his nameGad.\n12. AndZilpahLeahs maid bare Jacob second son.\n13. And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call meblessed: and she called his nameAsher.\n14. And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and foundmandrakesin the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy sons mandrakes.\n15. And she said unto her,Is ita small matter that thou hasttakenmy husband? and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy sons mandrakes.\n16. And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must comein unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my sons mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.\n17. And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.\n18. And Leah said, God hath given me myhire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his nameIssachar.\n19. And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.\n20. And Leah said, God hath endued mewitha good dowry; now will my husbanddwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his nameZebulun.\n21. And afterwards she bare daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n22. And GodrememberedRachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.\n23. And she conceived, and bare son; and said, God hath taken away myreproach:\n24. And she called his nameJoseph; and said, TheLordshall add to me another son.\n25. And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.\n26. Givememy wives and my children, for whom I haveservedthee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.\n27. And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes,tarry: forI have learned by experience that theLordhathblessedme for thysake.\n28. And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will giveit.\n29. And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.\n30. Forit waslittle which thou hadst before Icame,and it isnowincreased unto multitude; and theLordhath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?\n31. And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feedandkeep thy flock:\n32. I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spottedcattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: andof suchshall be my hire.\n33. So shall myrighteousnessanswer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one thatisnot speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.\n34. And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.\n35. And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,andevery one that hadsomewhite in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gavetheminto the hand of his sons.\n36. And he set three days journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Labans flocks.\n37. And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of thehazelandchestnut tree; andpilledwhite strakes in them, and made the white appear whichwasin the rods.\n38. And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.\n39. And the flocks conceived before therods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\n40. And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Labans cattle.\n41. And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.\n42. But when the cattle were feeble, he putthemnot in: so the feebler were Labans, and the stronger Jacobs.\n43. And the manincreasedexceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 31 ---\n1. And he heard the words of Labans sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all thatwasour fathers; and ofthatwhichwasour fathers hath he gotten all thisglory.\n2. And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, itwasnot toward him as before.\n3. And theLordsaid unto Jacob,Returnunto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; andIwill be with thee.\n4. AndJacobsent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,\n5. And said unto them, I see your fathers countenance, that itisnot toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.\n6. And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n7. And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.\n8. If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.\n9. Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and giventhemto me.\n10. And it came to pass at the time that thecattleconceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattlewereringstraked, speckled, and grisled.\n11. And theangelof God spake unto me in dream,saying,Jacob: And I said, HereamI.\n12. And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon thecattleareringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.\n13. IamtheGodof Beth-el, where thou anointedst thepillar,andwhere thou vowedst avowunto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.\n14. And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him,Is thereyet any portion orinheritancefor us in our fathers house?\n15. Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.\n16. For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, thatisours, and our childrens: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.\n17. Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;\n18. And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.\n19. And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen theimagesthatwereher fathers.\n20. And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban theSyrian, in that he told him not that he fled.\n21. So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his facetowardthe mount Gilead.\n22. And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n23. And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\n24. And God came to Laban the Syrian in adreamby night, and said unto him, Take heed that thouspeak notto Jacob either good or bad.\n25. Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.\n26. And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captivestakenwith the sword?\n27. Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and withharp?\n28. And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly insodoing.\n29. It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n30. And now,thoughthou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy fathers house,yetwherefore hast thou stolen my gods?\n31. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.\n32. With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou whatisthine with me, and takeitto thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.\n33. And Laban went into Jacobs tent, and into Leahs tent, and into the two maidservants tents; but he foundthemnot. Then went he out of Leahs tent, and entered into Rachels tent.\n34. Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camels furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but foundthemnot.\n35. And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of womenisupon me. And he searched, but found not the images.\n36. And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, Whatismy trespass? whatismy sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?\n37. Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? setithere before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.\n38. This twenty yearshaveIbeenwith thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.\n39. That which wastornof beastsI brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it,whetherstolen by day, or stolen by night.\n40. ThusI was; in the day thedroughtconsumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\n41. Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; Iservedthee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.\n42. Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and thelabourof my hands, and rebukedtheeyesternight.\n43. And Laban answered and said unto Jacob,Thesedaughtersaremy daughters, andthesechildrenaremy children, andthesecattlearemy cattle, and all that thou seestismine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?\n44. Now therefore come thou, let us make covenant, I and thou; and let it be for witness between me and thee.\n45. And Jacob took stone, and set it upforapillar.\n46. And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.\n47. And Laban called itJegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called itGaleed.\n48. And Laban said, This heapisa witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;\n49. AndMizpah; for he said, TheLordwatchbetween me and thee, when we are absent one from another.\n50. If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt takeotherwives beside my daughters, no maniswith us; see, Godiswitness betwixt me and thee.\n51. And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and beholdthispillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;\n52. This heapbewitness, andthispillarbewitness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.\n53. The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.\n54. Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eatbread, and tarried all night in the mount.\n55. And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 32 ---\n1. And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n2. And when Jacob saw them, he said, ThisisGodshost: and he called the name of that placeMahanaim.\n3. And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land ofSeir, the country ofEdom.\n4. And he commanded them,saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:\n5. And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.\n6. And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.\n7. Then Jacob was greatly afraid anddistressed: and he divided the people thatwaswith him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;\n8. And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.\n9. And Jacob said, OGodof my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, theLordwhich saidst unto me,Returnunto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:\n10. Iam not worthy of the least of all themercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.\n11. Deliverme, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,andthe mother with the children.\n12. And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thyseedas thesandof the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\n13. And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand present for Esau his brother;\n14. Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,\n15. Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.\n16. And he deliveredtheminto the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put space betwixt drove and drove.\n17. And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whoseartthou? and whither goest thou? and whosearethese before thee?\n18. Then thou shalt say,They bethy servant Jacobs; itisa present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also heisbehind us.\n19. And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.\n20. And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacobisbehind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.\n21. So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.\n22. And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.\n23. And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.\n24. And Jacob was left alone; and therewrestleda man with him until the breaking of the day.\n25. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and thehollow of Jacobs thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.\n26. And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.\n27. And he said unto him, Whatisthy name? And he said, Jacob.\n28. And he said, Thynameshall be called no more Jacob, butIsrael:foras aprincehast thoupowerwith God and with men, and hastprevailed.\n29. And Jacob askedhim,and said, Tellme,I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Whereforeisitthatthou dost ask after myname? And heblessedhim there.\n30. And Jacob called the name of the placePeniel: for I haveseenGodface to face, and my life is preserved.\n31. And as he passed overPenuelthe sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.\n32. Therefore the children of Israel eat notofthe sinew which shrank, whichisupon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacobs thigh in the sinew that shrank.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 33 ---\n1. And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.\n2. And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\n3. And he passed over before them, andbowedhimself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.\n4. And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.\n5. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Whoarethose with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.\n6. Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.\n7. And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\n8. And he said, Whatmeanestthou by all this drove which I met? And he said,These areto find grace in the sight of my lord.\n9. And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.\n10. And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.\n11. Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he tookit.\n12. And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.\n13. And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the childrenaretender, and the flocks and herds with youngarewith me: and if men shouldoverdrive them one day, all the flock will die.\n14. Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.\n15. And Esau said, Let me now leave with theesomeof the folk thatarewith me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.\n16. So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.\n17. And Jacob journeyed toSuccoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is calledSuccoth.\n18. And Jacob came to Shalem, city of Shechem, whichisin the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.\n19. And he bought parcel of field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechems father, for an hundred pieces of money.\n20. And he erected there an altar, and called itEl-elohe-Israel.",

      "content": "How do you secure for yourself a blessing from God? You might say that the account of Jacob, grandson of Abraham and Sarah, is the story of a man who learned the answer to that question. In a culture where the firstborn son received a birthright blessing, Jacob was born second, grasping the heel of his twin brother, Esau. The name “Jacob” means “supplanter”—one who replaces someone else. Jacob lived up to that name by trying, more than once, to supplant Esau as inheritor of the birthright blessing because Esau was unworthy of it (see\nGenesis 25:30–34\n;\n26:34–35\n;\n27:36\n). The result was discord in the family, and Jacob had to flee for his life into the wilderness.\nYears later, God commanded Jacob to return home. On the way, Jacob, in humility, again sought a blessing from God. The scriptures describe this time as a “wrestle” for Jacob, and he declared that he would not give up “except thou bless me” (\nGenesis 32:26\n). Then came the lesson—and the blessing. God changed Jacob’s name to Israel—meaning, among other things, “let God prevail.” Israel learned that to receive God’s most valuable blessings, His covenant blessings, it’s not necessary to supplant someone else. His blessings aren’t purchased or seized or won. He gives them freely to all who live up to the name of Israel—who let God prevail in their lives.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 24\nCovenant marriage is essential to God’s eternal plan.\nWhile reading\nGenesis 24\n, ask yourself why Abraham considered the marriage of his son Isaac to be so important. Why is marriage important to God?\nWhat qualities do you find in Rebekah that would contribute to a strong marriage and family? (see especially\nverses 15–28, 57–61\n).\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nMarriage\n,” Gospel Library.\nGenesis 25:29–34\nI can value eternal things over temporal things.\nIn Isaac and Rebekah’s culture, the oldest son received the birthright, which meant a greater inheritance, along with greater responsibilities for caring for the family. As you read\nGenesis 25:29–34\n, ponder why Esau might have been willing to give up his birthright in exchange for a meal. What lessons do you find for yourself in this account? It might help to make two lists: (1) eternal blessings God wants to give you and (2) worldly things that might distract you.

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 29 ---\nWhile the prospect of an eternal marriage may have seemed out of reach to Isaac, the Lord prepared a way for him. We can likewise rely on the Lord and trust that He can help us prepare for and someday obtain the blessings of eternal marriage. This lesson can help students understand the importance of eternal, covenant marriage in Heavenly Father’s plan. Student preparation: Invite students to write a question they or someone they know might have about temple marriage and come to class prayerfully seeking answers to that question. Possible Learning Activities Temple marriage As marriage can be difficult for some students to discuss, prayerfully ponder ways to prepare and teach this topic with sensitivity and love. To prepare students to discuss the topic of marriage, consider displaying the picture at the beginning of the lesson, along with the following scenario. Imagine a friend says: “Is it really that important to be married in the temple? I have a hard time seeing myself getting married there anyway; it feels out of reach for me. I just want to find someone I love.” What are some assumptions your friend might have about temple marriage? What truths might your friend not understand about God and temple marriage? Invite students to answer the following questions in their study journals. How do you personally feel about temple marriage? What questions or concerns do you have about temple marriage? As you study Genesis 24 , invite the Spirit to help you understand the importance of temple marriage. Seek insight on how the Lord can help you receive an eternal, temple marriage. An important journey To help students better understand the context of Genesis 24 , invite them to view the following map. If they have access to the Latter-day Saint edition of the King James Bible, they can find it as map 9, “The World of the Old Testament,” in the Bible Maps section. Read or summarize the following paragraph, and invite students to find the places you mention on the map. If needed, show students where Canaan (number 13) and Haran (number 8) are located. Abraham and his family lived in Canaan among people who worshipped idols and engaged in other sinful practices. Abraham had relatives that lived in Haran, where Abraham previously lived. Before reading the following verses, explain that the Joseph Smith Translation changes the word “thigh” to “hand” in verses 2 and 9 . This means that Abraham and his servant entered into an agreement. Read Genesis 24:1–4, 7–9 , looking for instructions Abraham gave his servant regarding his son Isaac. What was Abraham’s servant instructed to do? What do you see in verse 7 that shows the Lord cared about whom Isaac married? Have students use the scale on the map to determine how many miles or kilometers this journey would be. Help students see that Abraham asked his servant to travel nearly 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) round trip to find a wife for Isaac. Why do you think it was worth such sacrifice that Isaac not marry one of the Canaanite daughters? As needed, explain that when God established His covenant with Abraham and Sarah, He said that Abraham’s posterity would only keep this important covenant with Him if they married according to His law. They would need to enter into “the new and everlasting covenant of marriage” (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4 ). Today, we enter into this covenant when we are married in the Lord’s holy temples. There was no one in the land of Canaan whom Isaac could marry in the covenant. The covenant could only be preserved with someone from Abraham’s family in Haran. The Lord’s help Display the following image, and invite students to share what they know about the account pictured. You could read or summarize the following paragraph if needed. Abraham’s servant traveled the long distance to Haran to find a wife for Isaac. While waiting by a well, he prayed and asked God for the ability to know whom the Lord would have him find. You could invite students to read the following verses individually, in pairs, or as a class. For the below activity, it may be helpful to explain that the name “Jehovah” in the King James Version of the Bible is generally indicated by LORD in all capital letters. The words “Lord” or “lord”, on the other hand, may simply refer to someone holding power, authority, or influence, such as a master or ruler. (See Bible Dictionary, “ Jehovah ”) Read Genesis 24:12–27 , looking for how the Lord helped Abraham’s servant find a wife for Isaac. It may be helpful to mark when you see the word LORD when every letter is capitalized. What did you find? Consider summarizing the rest of Genesis 24 by sharing the following paragraph. Abraham’s servant met Rebekah’s brother and father. He explained who he was and how the Lord had helped him find Rebekah. The following day, Rebekah courageously chose to return with the servant and be sealed to Isaac in the covenant of eternal marriage (see Genesis 24:29–67 ). What do you learn about the Lord through the account of Isaac and Rebekah and their eternal marriage? Students may respond with a variety of truths, but be sure they understand that the Lord will help us as we strive to enter into the covenant of eternal marriage . How can the Lord help someone who is striving for an eternal marriage but worries they may never receive this blessing? Why do you think eternal marriage is so important to the Lord? Why eternal marriage? To help students better understand the importance of eternal marriage, invite them to draw in their study journals a simple image of a temple, such as the one below. Underneath your temple drawing, write a question that could help you better understand the truths you’ve learned today. This could be your own question, a question from someone you know, or one of the following: Why is eternal marriage important? What blessings can I obtain by being married in the temple and then striving to honor those covenants? How can the Lord help me someday obtain the blessings of eternal marriage? Invite students to take 5–8 minutes to complete the following activity individually or with partners. You could invite them to list in their study journals answers that they find. Help students understand that they might not find clear answers to their questions; however, the effort to ask questions and seek understanding is an important part of acting with faith in God. Distribute the handout titled “Eternal Marriage” to students who would like to study it. To help you respond to your question, search various Church resources, such as the following: Doctrinal mastery passages ( Genesis 2:24 ; 1 Corinthians 11:11 ; Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4 ) The handout titled “Eternal Marriage” “Marriage” and related entries in the Topical Guide, Guide to the Scriptures, or Topics and Questions in the Gospel Library Phrases such as “covenant marriage” or “temple marriage” in the Gospel Library search Open PDF Invite students to share with the class what they learned. Personal reflection Reflect on the scenario from the beginning of class. In your study journal, answer the following questions: How would you respond to your friend’s question about why temple marriage is important? What did you learn today about Heavenly Father or Jesus Christ that could give you hope in your efforts to invite the blessings of temple marriage? Invite willing students to share what they wrote. Consider sharing your testimony of the importance of covenant marriage, and encourage your students to begin now to prepare for it.\n\n\n--- Lesson 30 ---\nWith the birth of their twins Jacob and Esau, the covenant promise of posterity for Rebekah and Isaac was at last realized. Esau, as the elder twin, would have been entitled to the birthright promises given to the firstborn son. Tragically, Esau did not prioritize his eternal blessings, instead seeking to satisfy his worldly desires. This lesson can help students value the Lord’s eternal blessings over worldly desires. Student preparation: Encourage students to prayerfully evaluate the balance in their lives between the things of God (e.g., prayer, scripture study, church activity) and the things of the world. Invite them to identify any worldly distractions that may be taking priority over eternal things. Possible Learning Activities Valuing the things of God To help students think about how immediate needs or wants can sometimes affect long-term goals, draw the following chart on the board: Now Future Now Future Invite a few students to share a goal they have for their future. List these on the board in the second column. Select one of the goals in the second column. Invite students to think about immediate needs or wants that, if acted upon, could prevent someone from achieving that goal. Give students an opportunity to share a few different ideas. Discuss how choices we make now can affect our future goals and maybe even prevent us from achieving them. When students have finished, explain that this concept can also apply to our efforts to seek God’s eternal blessings. Invite students to complete the following self-assessment in their study journals. Prayerfully reflect on the following statements. Record in your journal how much each statement applies to you, using the answers “definitely,” “mostly,” “a little,” and “not at all.” I am willing to sacrifice earthly desires for eternal blessings. I understand why the Lord asks me to value His eternal blessings over things I want now. I recognize the blessings that come when I prioritize Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ over the things of the world. As you study today, invite the Holy Ghost to help you see the value of eternal blessings. Seek inspiration about how to prioritize eternal blessings over earthly desires. Birthright inheritance and blessing To help students understand the cultural significance of the decisions Esau and Jacob made, summarize the following paragraphs in your own words. In Old Testament times, the oldest son typically received the birthright. The birthright inheritance included a double portion of land and wealth. It also included greater responsibility to care for the mother and the rest of the family following the death of the father. In addition to the temporal inheritance, the father would give a birthright blessing to confer priesthood authority upon the oldest son. This blessing established the son’s position in the family as teacher and leader. Rebekah and Isaac prayed for the blessing of a righteous posterity for many years. Eventually, they were blessed with twin boys, Esau and Jacob. Because Esau was born first, he would have been the birthright son. However, the Lord had revealed to Rebekah that Jacob was to be the birthright son ( Genesis 25:22–23 ). Read Genesis 25:27–34 , looking for how Esau demonstrated that he did not value his birthright blessing. (To “sod pottage” means to cook soup or stew.) What did you find? Read Genesis 26:34–35 , looking for Esau’s decision and his parents feelings about his marriage choices. (Hittites were Canaanites who worshipped false gods.) Why were Rebekah and Isaac grieved by Esau’s decision? If students are not sure how to respond to the previous question, you might explain that the Canaanites worshipped idols and engaged in other sinful practices. Marrying Canaanite women meant that Esau turned away from the covenant God made with Abraham and his posterity. The blessings of valuing the things of God To help students understand the story of Jacob and Esau, the following paragraph could be read or summarized. Or you could share the video “ Jacob and Esau ” (2:06), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 2:5 Despite Esau’s bad choices, Isaac in his old age summoned Esau to give him the birthright blessing. Before Esau arrived, Rebekah disguised Jacob as his brother. Thinking Jacob was Esau, Isaac blessed Jacob with the birthright blessing (see Genesis 27:1–29 ). “After Isaac acknowledged that he had blessed Jacob instead of Esau, he affirmed that Jacob ‘shall be blessed’ ( Genesis 27:33 )—suggesting that God’s will had been accomplished” ( Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: Old Testament 2022 , 39). Read Genesis 27:34, 38 , looking for Esau’s reaction when he learned that Isaac had given the birthright blessing to Jacob. What stands out to you? How would you summarize what we learn from this story as a statement of truth? Use students’ words to identify a truth similar to the following: Choosing immediate or worldly desires over God’s eternal blessings can lead to sorrow and regret. There are a lot of possible answers to the following question. Encouraging several students to share their answers can help students feel safe to share different ideas and perspectives. Why can it sometimes be challenging to prioritize things that have eternal value? Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained: In the busyness of our daily lives and in the commotion of the contemporary world in which we live, we may be distracted from the eternal things that matter the most by making pleasure, prosperity, popularity, and prominence our primary priorities. Our short-term preoccupation with “the things of this world” and “the honors of men” may lead us to forfeit our spiritual birthright for far less than a mess of pottage. … Each of us should evaluate our temporal and spiritual priorities sincerely and prayerfully to identify the things in our lives that may impede the bounteous blessings that Heavenly Father and the Savior are willing to bestow upon us. (“ Put On Thy Strength, O Zion ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 94) Have students share what they liked or learned from Elder Bednar’s statement. Then invite them to do the following three things individually or in small groups: Create a scenario where someone your age may be tempted to “forfeit our spiritual birthright for far less than a mess of pottage.” Think of an example of how the Savior prioritized His Father’s will over immediate or worldly desires. (For example, see Matthew 4:2–10 or Luke 22:41–42 .) Think of a modern-day example of someone prioritizing God’s will over immediate or worldly desires. Ask students to share their ideas. As students share, you could point out that attending seminary today is a good example of putting God first. You could show the video “ No Regrets ” (5:38) from ChurchofJesusChrist.org . A young man chose to attend seminary over surfing. Encourage students to look for the blessings he received because of this choice. 5:39 What blessings can we receive, now and in the future, for choosing the things of God over the things of the world? How did the Savior place eternal blessings above immediate desires? Make a plan Invite students to complete the following activity in their study journals. List your top five priorities in order of most to least important. As you review this list, note any adjustments the Holy Ghost impresses you to make. Below this list, record any other thoughts you have after doing this activity. Can you identify a clear next step for you to prioritize the things of God more than the things of the world? If so, write this somewhere you will see it regularly. To conclude class, you could share your witness of blessings you have received as you have valued the things of God over the things of the world.\n\n\n--- Lesson 31 ---\nAfter his life was threatened by his brother Esau, Jacob was directed by his parents to travel to his mother’s homeland to find a wife. While journeying, he had a vision that led him to enter into the Abrahamic covenant with God. This lesson can help students feel an increased desire to make covenants with God in the temple. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to review the promises of the Abrahamic covenant ( Abraham 2:8–11 ). Students could be encouraged to try and explain to a member of their family about the Abrahamic covenant and why it is important to them. Possible Learning Activities Why covenants? You could begin class by displaying a picture of a temple and singing the Primary song “ I Love to See the Temple ” ( Children’s Songbook , 95). Then display the following prompt. Invite students to select the statement that is most true of them. Alternatively, you could share only the first part of the prompt, and students could finish the statement in a sentence or two that accurately reflects their feelings and thoughts. When I think about going to the temple in the future to make covenants with God, I: Don’t know what to think. I don’t think about it very much. Get excited. I really look forward to that day. Am a little nervous. I don’t know what to expect. Don’t see much of a point to it. Give students time to write their responses. Invite them to seek inspiration from the Holy Ghost during the lesson. The Holy Ghost can help them appreciate the importance of making covenants with God. Jacob’s dream Invite students to write the following incomplete truth in their study journals. You could also write it on the board and add to it throughout the lesson. In this lesson, you will study about Jacob in Genesis 28 . In Genesis 28:3–4, 12–20 , God established a covenant with Jacob, which Jacob accepted. From this account, we can learn important lessons about the value of making covenants with God. As you study this lesson, look for ways to complete this truth: As we make and keep covenants with God, He will … Ask students to share what they remember about the covenant the Lord made with Abraham. For specific details on this covenant, see Lesson 23 : “ Genesis 12, 17 .” After students share, summarize the following paragraph in your own words. Although Jacob was Abraham’s grandson, he may have felt like the blessings of Abraham’s covenant were out of reach for him. Jacob had not yet married in the covenant. Also, conflict over the birthright and blessing had led Esau to want to take Jacob’s life ( Genesis 27:41 ). To protect Jacob and ensure he had the opportunity to marry in the covenant, Jacob’s parents instructed him to leave home and journey several hundred miles to his mother’s homeland (see Genesis 27:42–46 ; 28:1–2 ). This journey would take Jacob far away from Canaan, the land the birthright promised him. Read Genesis 28:10–15 , looking for what Jacob experienced one night during his journey. Consider inviting students to draw a picture of what Jacob saw in his dream. Students could share their drawings with a partner and explain what stood out to them from the verses. You might then display the following image as one depiction of the vision. What promises from the Abrahamic covenant did the Lord offer Jacob in these verses? What additional promises did the Lord give Jacob in verse 15 ? You could invite students to add these additional promises to their truth. You might list possible responses on the board. Responses might include be with us, protect and care for us , not leave us . Why do you think these promises might have been particularly meaningful to Jacob at this time? To help students better understand these promises, invite them to complete the following activity in pairs or small groups. You might want to encourage students to look for additional scriptures or statements that confirm these promises. Study the following scriptures and statement, looking for how they deepen your understanding of the promises the Lord made to Jacob. John 14:18 Acts 17:27 (note the Joseph Smith Translation) Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said: As you walk the covenant path, from baptism to the temple and throughout life, I promise you power to go against the natural worldly flow—power to learn, power to repent and be sanctified, and power to find hope, comfort, and even joy as you face life’s challenges. I promise you and your family protection against the influence of the adversary, especially when you make the temple a major focus in your life. (“ Accessing God’s Power through Covenants ,” Liahona , May 2023, 37) It might be helpful for students to understand that making covenants does not spare us from challenges in life. However, Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught that these covenants do provide “our greatest hope for avoiding avoidable misery on the one hand and successfully dealing with the unavoidable woes of life on the other” (“ Why the Covenant Path ,” Liahona , May 2021, 117). Which of these promises are most meaningful to you? Jacob’s feelings about his experience It might be helpful to display the following passage and questions. Invite students to read and discuss in pairs or small groups. (Consider sharing with students that the words “afraid” and “dreadful” show that Jacob was in awe. “Dreadful” is better translated as “awe-inspiring.”) Read Genesis 28:16–21 , looking for Jacob’s reaction to his experience. What feelings about the Lord do you see Jacob expressing? How might these feelings motivate him to make a covenant with the Lord? After students have had time to discuss, you could invite a few to share with the class what they learned. Providing opportunities for students to share with each other what they are learning can increase their confidence in participating in gospel conversations. For additional training on how to encourage students to share with others, see “ Encourage learners to share the truths they are learning ” in Teacher Development Skills. (Teaching in the Savior’s Way [2022], 35) What words or phrases from verses 16–21 could relate to modern-day temples? Students might point out words or phrases like “surely the Lord is in this place” ( verse 16 ); “the house of God” and “the gate of heaven” ( verse 17 ); “Beth-el” ( verse 19 ), which means “house of God” (see footnote 19a); and “vowed a vow” ( verse 20 ). You might want to invite students to mark these phrases in their scriptures. Students could add to their drawings of the vision by writing “house of God,” “gate of heaven,” or “temple” somewhere near the bottom of the ladder. Making covenants with the Lord Invite students to do the following activity in their study journals. It might be helpful to tell students that they will reflect on these responses in a future lesson. Students will use what they write here to complete an assessment activity in Lesson 37: “ Assess Your Learning 2 .” To prepare students to write their responses, you might want to share the following paragraph in your own words. As Jacob left his parents’ home and set out on his own, he made covenants with God. God promised to be with, care for, and protect Jacob. In a few short years, you will face many choices about what to do next in your life. Among these decisions will be the opportunity to make covenants with God in the temple. Think about this time in your future as you respond to the following questions in your study journal: What promised blessings have you experienced from striving to keep your covenants with God or by serving in the temple? What situations might you face in the future where you would benefit from the care and protection God promises to people who make covenants with Him? Consider sharing your testimony of how you have experienced the promises associated with making and keeping covenants with the Lord.\n\n\n--- Lesson 32 ---\nThe prophet Jacob is an example of letting God prevail in his life. He went to great effort to marry in the covenant, gain the Lord’s blessings in his day-to-day work, and do what God asked him to do to heal his family relationships. This lesson can help students increase their willingness to let God prevail in their lives. Student preparation: Consider inviting students to list ways God is an influence in their lives. If students would like to learn more on this subject, they can listen, watch, or read portions of President Russell M. Nelson’s talk, “ Let God Prevail ” (18:51). Videos: “ Let God Prevail ” (18:51) from time code 12:18 to 13:02, “ Jacob and His Family ” (3:00) Possible Learning Activities The influences in our lives Consider inviting students to make a list in their study journal of some of the influences in their lives. They might include friends, teachers, counselors, media personalities, parents, prophets, the Lord, and even their own thoughts and ambitions. Then invite them to thoughtfully rank the influence each item on the list has. Students could put a number 1 by the strongest influence in their life, then a number 2, and so forth. Or students could write words like “high,” “medium,” or “low” to indicate the amount of influence for each item. Before they read the following statement, it may be useful to explain that letting God prevail is allowing Him to be the greatest influence in our lives. Read the following inspired questions by President Russell M. Nelson. Ponder how you would answer them. 18:52 Are you willing to let God prevail in your life? Are you willing to let God be the most important influence in your life? Will you allow His words, His commandments, and His covenants to influence what you do each day? Will you allow His voice to take priority over any other? Are you willing to let whatever He needs you to do take precedence over every other ambition? Are you willing to have your will swallowed up in His? (“ Let God Prevail ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 94). Invite students to write their responses to these questions in their study journal. These could include ways they are willing to let God prevail or be the greatest influence in their lives. They can also include ways they are not willing and why it is difficult for them. Seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to give you insights and help with any of your concerns or difficulties, and to help you feel an increased desire to let Him prevail more in your life. Jacob’s example On one occasion, Jacob was “greatly afraid and distressed” ( Genesis 32:7 ), worried for his and his family’s safety. He “wrestled” ( Genesis 32:25 ) all night, determined to obtain the Lord’s blessings for the difficult situation he faced. (You will study more of this situation later in the lesson.) In response, the Lord promised to help Jacob, but He also changed Jacob’s name. Read Genesis 32:28 and mark what the Lord changed Jacob’s name to and why. Consider inviting students to note in their scriptures that one of the meanings of the name Israel is “Let God prevail” (footnote 28b, see Bible Dictionary, “ Israel ”) This lesson highlights three areas of Jacob’s, or Israel’s, life in which he let God prevail. As you study, look for examples of the following principle: As we are willing to let God prevail in our lives, He will bless us in all things. Prepare copies of the following handouts and do one of the following: Give these handouts to three students or groups of students ahead of time and invite them to lead the class through the material. Invite students to complete all three activities in small groups. Give students a basic overview of the three handouts and allow students to select one or two to study. One way to provide an overview is to watch “ Jacob and His Family ” (3:00). 3:0 Open PDF Open PDF Open PDF If students studied these three sections in groups, invite them to share what they learned and how it may be meaningful to them. If they do not naturally mention it, ask what they learned about the Lord. Consider asking students to share other examples they have seen of people who let God prevail in their lives. Letting God prevail in your life Take a moment to ponder what you learned or want to remember from this lesson. Seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost as you add your thoughts to your journal entry from the beginning of the lesson. Include reasons why you may want to let God prevail in your life. You may also include what you feel you could do to increase your desire to let God prevail in your life. If they are not too personal, invite students to share their thoughts. Consider sharing your own thoughts and testimony as well.",

And I will make theeswearby theLord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shaltnottake awifeunto my son of the daughters of theCanaanites, among whom I dwell:\n4. But thou shalt go unto mycountry, and to mykindred, and take wife unto my son Isaac.\n5. And the servant said unto him,Peradventurethe woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?\n6. And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.\n7. TheLordGodof heaven, which took me from myfathershouse, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give thisland; he shall send hisangelbefore thee, and thou shalt take wife unto my son from thence.\n8. And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.\n9. And the servant put his hand under thethighof Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.\n10. And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his masterwerein his hand: and he arose, and went toMesopotamia, unto the city ofNahor.\n11. And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by well of water at the time of the evening,eventhe time that women go out to drawwater.\n12. And he said, OLordGodof my master Abraham, I pray thee,sendme good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.\n13. Behold, I standhereby the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to drawwater:\n14. And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also:let the same beshethatthou hastappointedfor thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.\n15. And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born toBethuel, son ofMilcah, the wife of Nahor, Abrahams brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\n16. And the damselwasveryfairto look upon, virgin, neither had any manknown her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.\n17. And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink little water of thy pitcher.\n18. And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.\n19. And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will drawwaterfor thy camels also, until they have done drinking.\n20. And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to drawwater,and drew for all his camels.\n21. And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether theLordhad made his journeyprosperousor not.\n22. And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took goldenearringof half shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of tenshekelsweight of gold;\n23. And said, Whose daughterartthou? tell me, I pray thee: is there roominthy fathers house for us to lodge in?\n24. And she said unto him, Iamthe daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare untoNahor.\n25. She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.\n26. And the manboweddown his head, and worshipped theLord.\n27. And he said, BlessedbetheLordGodof my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of hismercyand his truth: Ibeingin the way, theLordledme to the house of my masters brethren.\n28. And the damsel ran, and toldthem ofher mothers house these things.\n29. And Rebekah had brother, and his namewasLaban: andLabanran out unto the man, unto the well.\n30. And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sisters hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.\n31. And he said, Come in, thoublessedof theLord; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.\n32. And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw andprovenderfor the camels, and water towashhis feet, and the mens feet thatwerewith him.\n33. And there was setmeatbeforehim to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.\n34. And he said, IamAbrahams servant.\n35. And theLordhathblessedmy master greatly; and he is becomegreat: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.\n36. And Sarah my masters wife bare asonto my master when she wasold: and unto him hath hegivenall that he hath.\n37. And my master made meswear, saying, Thou shalt not take wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:\n38. But thou shalt go unto myfathershouse, and to my kindred, and take wife unto my son.\n39. And I said unto my master,Peradventurethe woman will not follow me.\n40. And he said unto me, TheLord, before whom Iwalk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take wife for my son of my kindred, and of my fathers house:\n41. Then shalt thou be clear fromthismy oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not theeone,thou shalt be clear from my oath.\n42. And I came this day unto the well, and said, OLordGod of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:\n43. Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to drawwater,and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, little water of thy pitcher to drink;\n44. And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels:letthe samebethe woman whom theLordhathappointedout for my masters son.\n45. And before I had done speaking in mineheart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drewwater:and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.\n46. And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from hershoulder,and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.\n47. And I asked her, and said, Whose daughterartthou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahors son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put theearring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.\n48. And Iboweddown my head, and worshipped theLord, and blessed theLordGod of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my masters brothersdaughterunto his son.\n49. And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.\n50. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from theLord: we cannotspeakunto thee bad or good.\n51. Behold, Rebekahisbefore thee, takeher,and go, and let her be thy masters sonswife, as theLordhath spoken.\n52. And it came to pass, that, when Abrahams servant heard their words, he worshipped theLord,bowing himselfto the earth.\n53. And the servant brought forthjewelsof silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gavethemto Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.\n54. And they did eat and drink, he and the men thatwerewith him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.\n55. And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with usa fewdays, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\n56. And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing theLordhathprosperedmy way; send me away that I may go to my master.\n57. And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.\n58. And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.\n59. And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and hernurse, and Abrahams servant, and his men.\n60. And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thouartour sister, be thouthemotherof thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess thegateof those whichhatethem.\n61. And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.\n62. And Isaac came from the way of thewellLahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.\n63. And Isaac went out tomeditatein the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camelswerecoming.\n64. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac,she lighted offthe camel.\n65. For shehadsaid unto the servant, What manisthis that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servanthadsaid, Itismy master: therefore she took veil, and covered herself.\n66. And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.\n67.

And Esau went to the field to huntforvenison,andto bringit.\n6. AndRebekahspake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,\n7. Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before theLordbefore my death.\n8. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.\n9.

And Jacob said unto his father, IamEsau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n20. And Isaac said unto his son, Howis itthat thou hast founditso quickly, my son? And he said, Because theLordthy God broughtitto me.\n21. And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thoubemy very son Esau or not.\n22. And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voiceisJacobs voice, but the handsarethe hands of Esau.\n23. And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esaus hands: so he blessed him.\n24. And he said,Artthou my very son Esau? And he said, Iam.\n25. And he said, Bringitnear to me, and I will eat of my sons venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he broughtitnear to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.\n26.

And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? whereishe that hathtaken venison, and broughtitme, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and haveblessedhim? yea,andhe shall be blessed.\n34. And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,evenme also, O my father.\n35. And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.\n36. And he said, Is not he rightly namedJacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away mybirthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved blessing for me?\n37. And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him forservants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?\n38.

And Esau hated Jacob becauseof the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.\n42. And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself,purposingto kill thee.\n43. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise,fleethou to Laban mybrothertoHaran;\n44. And tarry with him few days, until thy brothers fury turn away;\n45.

And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the wells mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the wells mouth in his place.\n4. And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whencebeye? And they said, OfHaranarewe.\n5. And he said unto them, Know yeLabanthe son of Nahor? And they said, We knowhim.\n6. And he said unto them,Ishe well? And they said,He iswell: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\n7. And he said, Lo,it isyet high day, neitheris ittime that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and goandfeedthem.\n8. And they said, We cannot, until allthe flocksbe gathered together, andtillthey roll the stone from the wells mouth; then we water the sheep.\n9. And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her fathers sheep: for she kept them.\n10. And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mothers brother, and the sheep of Laban his mothers brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the wells mouth, andwateredthe flock of Laban his mothers brother.\n11. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n12. And Jacob told Rachel that hewasher fathers brother, and that hewasRebekahs son: and she ran and told her father.\n13. And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sisters son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.\n14. And Laban said to him, Surely thouartmy bone and myflesh. And he abode with him the space of month.\n15. And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thouartmy brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, whatshallthy wagesbe?\n16. And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elderwasLeah, and the name of the youngerwasRachel.\n17. Leahwastender eyed; but Rachelwasbeautifuland wellfavoured.\n18. And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I willservethee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.\n19. And Laban said,It isbetter that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.\n20. And Jacob served seven years forRachel; and they seemed unto himbuta few days, for thelovehe had to her.\n21. And Jacob said unto Laban, Givememy wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.\n22. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made afeast.\n23. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.\n24. And Laban gave unto his daughter LeahZilpahhis maidforan handmaid.\n25. And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, itwasLeah: and he said to Laban, Whatisthis thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?\n26. And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before thefirstborn.\n27. Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n28. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.\n29. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughterBilhahhis handmaid to be her maid.\n30. And he went in also unto Rachel, and helovedalso Rachel more than Leah, andservedwith him yet seven other years.\n31. And when theLordsaw that Leahwashated, he opened her womb: but Rachelwasbarren.\n32. AndLeahconceived, and bare son, and she called his nameReuben: for she said, Surely theLordhath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.\n33. And she conceived again, and bare son; and said, Because theLordhath heard that Iwashated, he hath therefore given me thissonalso: and she called his nameSimeon.\n34. And she conceived again, and bare son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name calledLevi.\n35.

And Jacobs anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said,AmI inGodsstead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\n3. And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may alsohave children by her.\n4. And she gave himBilhahher handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.\n5. AndBilhahconceived, and bare Jacob son.\n6. And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me son: therefore called she his nameDan.\n7. And Bilhah Rachels maid conceived again, and bare Jacob second son.\n8. And Rachel said,Withgreat wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his nameNaphtali.\n9. When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.\n10. And Zilpah Leahs maid bare Jacob son.\n11. And Leah said, Atroopcometh: and she called his nameGad.\n12. AndZilpahLeahs maid bare Jacob second son.\n13. And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call meblessed: and she called his nameAsher.\n14. And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and foundmandrakesin the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy sons mandrakes.\n15. And she said unto her,Is ita small matter that thou hasttakenmy husband? and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy sons mandrakes.\n16. And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must comein unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my sons mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.\n17. And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.\n18. And Leah said, God hath given me myhire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his nameIssachar.\n19. And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.\n20. And Leah said, God hath endued mewitha good dowry; now will my husbanddwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his nameZebulun.\n21. And afterwards she bare daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n22. And GodrememberedRachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.\n23. And she conceived, and bare son; and said, God hath taken away myreproach:\n24. And she called his nameJoseph; and said, TheLordshall add to me another son.\n25. And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.\n26. Givememy wives and my children, for whom I haveservedthee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.\n27. And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes,tarry: forI have learned by experience that theLordhathblessedme for thysake.\n28. And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will giveit.\n29. And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.\n30. Forit waslittle which thou hadst before Icame,and it isnowincreased unto multitude; and theLordhath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?\n31. And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feedandkeep thy flock:\n32. I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spottedcattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: andof suchshall be my hire.\n33. So shall myrighteousnessanswer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one thatisnot speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.\n34. And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.\n35. And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,andevery one that hadsomewhite in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gavetheminto the hand of his sons.\n36. And he set three days journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Labans flocks.\n37. And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of thehazelandchestnut tree; andpilledwhite strakes in them, and made the white appear whichwasin the rods.\n38. And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.\n39. And the flocks conceived before therods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\n40. And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Labans cattle.\n41. And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.\n42. But when the cattle were feeble, he putthemnot in: so the feebler were Labans, and the stronger Jacobs.\n43.

And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, itwasnot toward him as before.\n3. And theLordsaid unto Jacob,Returnunto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; andIwill be with thee.\n4. AndJacobsent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,\n5. And said unto them, I see your fathers countenance, that itisnot toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.\n6. And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n7. And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.\n8. If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.\n9. Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and giventhemto me.\n10. And it came to pass at the time that thecattleconceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattlewereringstraked, speckled, and grisled.\n11. And theangelof God spake unto me in dream,saying,Jacob: And I said, HereamI.\n12. And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon thecattleareringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.\n13. IamtheGodof Beth-el, where thou anointedst thepillar,andwhere thou vowedst avowunto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.\n14. And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him,Is thereyet any portion orinheritancefor us in our fathers house?\n15. Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.\n16. For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, thatisours, and our childrens: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.\n17. Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;\n18. And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.\n19. And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen theimagesthatwereher fathers.\n20. And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban theSyrian, in that he told him not that he fled.\n21. So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his facetowardthe mount Gilead.\n22. And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n23. And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\n24. And God came to Laban the Syrian in adreamby night, and said unto him, Take heed that thouspeak notto Jacob either good or bad.\n25. Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.\n26. And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captivestakenwith the sword?\n27. Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and withharp?\n28. And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly insodoing.\n29. It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n30. And now,thoughthou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy fathers house,yetwherefore hast thou stolen my gods?\n31. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.\n32. With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou whatisthine with me, and takeitto thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.\n33. And Laban went into Jacobs tent, and into Leahs tent, and into the two maidservants tents; but he foundthemnot. Then went he out of Leahs tent, and entered into Rachels tent.\n34. Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camels furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but foundthemnot.\n35. And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of womenisupon me. And he searched, but found not the images.\n36. And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, Whatismy trespass? whatismy sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?\n37. Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? setithere before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.\n38. This twenty yearshaveIbeenwith thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.\n39. That which wastornof beastsI brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it,whetherstolen by day, or stolen by night.\n40. ThusI was; in the day thedroughtconsumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\n41. Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; Iservedthee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.\n42. Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and thelabourof my hands, and rebukedtheeyesternight.\n43. And Laban answered and said unto Jacob,Thesedaughtersaremy daughters, andthesechildrenaremy children, andthesecattlearemy cattle, and all that thou seestismine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?\n44. Now therefore come thou, let us make covenant, I and thou; and let it be for witness between me and thee.\n45. And Jacob took stone, and set it upforapillar.\n46. And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.\n47. And Laban called itJegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called itGaleed.\n48. And Laban said, This heapisa witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;\n49. AndMizpah; for he said, TheLordwatchbetween me and thee, when we are absent one from another.\n50. If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt takeotherwives beside my daughters, no maniswith us; see, Godiswitness betwixt me and thee.\n51. And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and beholdthispillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;\n52. This heapbewitness, andthispillarbewitness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.\n53. The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.\n54. Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eatbread, and tarried all night in the mount.\n55. And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.",

And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land ofSeir, the country ofEdom.\n4. And he commanded them,saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:\n5. And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.\n6. And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.\n7. Then Jacob was greatly afraid anddistressed: and he divided the people thatwaswith him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;\n8. And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.\n9. And Jacob said, OGodof my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, theLordwhich saidst unto me,Returnunto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:\n10. Iam not worthy of the least of all themercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.\n11. Deliverme, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,andthe mother with the children.\n12. And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thyseedas thesandof the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\n13. And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand present for Esau his brother;\n14. Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,\n15. Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.\n16. And he deliveredtheminto the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put space betwixt drove and drove.\n17. And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whoseartthou? and whither goest thou? and whosearethese before thee?\n18. Then thou shalt say,They bethy servant Jacobs; itisa present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also heisbehind us.\n19. And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.\n20. And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacobisbehind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.\n21. So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.\n22. And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.\n23. And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.\n24. And Jacob was left alone; and therewrestleda man with him until the breaking of the day.\n25. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and thehollow of Jacobs thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.\n26. And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.\n27. And he said unto him, Whatisthy name? And he said, Jacob.\n28. And he said, Thynameshall be called no more Jacob, butIsrael:foras aprincehast thoupowerwith God and with men, and hastprevailed.\n29. And Jacob askedhim,and said, Tellme,I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Whereforeisitthatthou dost ask after myname? And heblessedhim there.\n30. And Jacob called the name of the placePeniel: for I haveseenGodface to face, and my life is preserved.\n31. And as he passed overPenuelthe sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.\n32.
