These prophecies would have been especially precious to the Israelites centuries later when they were in captivity in Babylon. Someone who could tear down the walls of Babylon would be a mighty conqueror indeed. But that isn’t the kind of Messiah that Isaiah described in\nchapters 52–53\n: “He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him. … We did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted” (\nIsaiah 53:3–4\n).\nBy sending such an unexpected deliverer, God taught us about true deliverance. To save us from oppression and affliction, God sent One who Himself “was oppressed, and … afflicted.” Where some expected a lion, He sent a lamb (see\nIsaiah 53:7\n). Surely, God’s ways are not our ways (see\nIsaiah 55:8–9\n). Jesus Christ frees us not by just opening the prison but by taking our place there. He relieves us from our chains of grief and sorrow by bearing them Himself (see\nIsaiah 53:4–5, 12\n). He does not save us from a distance. He suffers with us, in acts of “everlasting kindness” that “shall not depart from thee” (\nIsaiah 54:8, 10\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 50–52\nThe future is bright for the Lord’s people.\nEven though the Israelites spent many years in captivity—and even though that captivity was a result of their own poor choices—the Lord wanted them to look to the future with hope. What do you find in Isaiah’s message that gives you hope? A chart like this one might help you study:\nWhat I learn about God\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:2, 5–9\n;\n51:3–8, 15–16\n;\n52:3, 9–10\n)\nMessages of hope\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:9\n;\n51:3–5, 11–12, 22–23\n;\n52:9–10\n)\nWhat I can do to make hope a reality\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:10\n;\n51:1–2, 6–9\n;\n52:1–3, 9–11\n)\nSee also\nMosiah 12:20–24\n;\n15:13–18\n;\n3 Nephi 20:29–46\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 113:7–10\n; Russell M. Nelson, “\nEmbrace the Future with Faith\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 73–76.\nBecause of Love\n, by Angela Johnson\nHelp learners come unto Jesus Christ.\n“Nothing you do as a teacher will bless learners more than helping them know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and feel Their love” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n8\n). As you prepare to teach\nIsaiah 50–57\nto others, consider how you can help them see connections between Israel’s challenges, Isaiah’s prophecies of Christ, and receiving divine help with their own struggles.\nIsaiah 53\nJesus Christ took upon Himself my sins and sorrows.\nFew chapters in scripture describe Jesus Christ’s redemptive mission more beautifully than\nIsaiah 53\n. Consider activities like these to better understand and apply these powerful teachings:\nPonder or discuss how stories and movies often depict heroes who rescue people. Contrast those depictions with the descriptions of the Savior in\nIsaiah 53\n.\nAfter reading each verse, pause to contemplate what the Savior suffered—the “griefs,” “sorrows,” and “transgressions” He bore—for all people and specifically for you. You might replace words like “we” and “our” with “I” and “my” as you read. What feelings or thoughts do these verses inspire in you?\nConsider watching the video “My Kingdom Is Not of This World” (Gospel Library), and ponder how the prophecies in\nIsaiah 53\nwere fulfilled. What are some of the griefs and sorrows the Savior carries for you?\n5:25\nMy Kingdom Is Not of This World\nFind pictures of the events surrounding the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 56–60\n). You could then find phrases in\nIsaiah 53\nthat describe the events in the pictures. What do these teachings inspire you to do?\nSee also “\nBehold the Great Redeemer Die\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 191.\nIsaiah 54\n;\n57:15–19\nJesus Christ wants me to return to Him.\nWe all have times when we feel distant from the Lord because of our sins or weaknesses. Some have even given up hope that He will ever forgive them.\nIsaiah 54\nand\n57\nare great chapters to read for reassurance and encouragement during such times. Particularly in\nIsaiah 54:4–10\n;\n57:15–19\n, what words teach you how the Savior feels about you? What difference does it make in your life to know these things about Him?\nPresident Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:\n“It matters not how completely ruined our lives may seem. It matters not how scarlet our sins, how deep our bitterness, how lonely, abandoned, or broken our hearts may be. Even those who are without hope, who live in despair, who have betrayed trust, surrendered their integrity, or turned away from God can be rebuilt. …\n“The joyous news of the gospel is this: because of the eternal plan of happiness provided by our loving Heavenly Father and through the infinite sacrifice of Jesus the Christ, we can not only be redeemed from our fallen state and restored to purity, but we can also transcend mortal imagination and become heirs of eternal life and partakers of God’s indescribable glory” (“\nHe Will Place You on His Shoulders and Carry You Home\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 102).\nSee also Patrick Kearon, “\nGod’s Intent Is to Bring You Home\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 87–89.\nIsaiah 55–56\nThe Lord invites all to “take hold of my covenant.”\nFor generations, Israel had been identified as God’s covenant people. However, God’s plan has always included more than just one nation, for “every one that thirsteth” is invited to “come … to the waters” (\nIsaiah 55:1\n). Keep this in mind as you read\nIsaiah 55\nand\n56\n, and ponder what it means to be God’s people. What is God’s message to those who feel “utterly separated” from Him? (\nIsaiah 56:3\n). Consider marking verses that describe attitudes and actions of those who “take hold of my covenant” (see\nIsaiah 56:4–7\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nIsaiah 51–52\nThe Lord invites me to “put on [my] strength.”\nIt might be fun for your children to discover phrases like “awake,” “stand up,” and “put on thy strength” in\nIsaiah 51:9, 17\n;\n52:1–2, 9\nand then act out those phrases. After doing so, you could talk about what it means to awake, stand up, and put on strength spiritually. What is the Lord asking us to do in these verses?\nYour children could also read\nIsaiah 51:1, 4, 7\nand identify who the Lord is speaking to and what He wants them to do. What does it mean to “hearken unto” the Lord? How can we show the Lord that we “hearken unto” Him?\nIsaiah 53:3–9\nJesus Christ took upon Himself my sins and sorrows.\nYou and your children could look at several pictures showing the suffering and death of Jesus Christ (see, for example,\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n56\n,\n57\n,\n58\n). Then you could read together\nIsaiah 53:3–6, 9\nand look for words that describe what is happening in the pictures. Help your children understand that Isaiah shared these truths hundreds of years before they happened. Why would it be important for people to know these things so many years in advance? (see\nAlma 39:15–19\n).\nAfter reading from\nIsaiah 53:4\n, “He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,” your children could try to lift a heavy object (or pretend to lift one). Talk about how “grief” and “sorrow” or sadness can feel heavy and hard to carry. Why did Jesus carry our “griefs,” “sorrows,” and “iniquities” or sins? (see also\nAlma 7:11–12\n).\nIsaiah 55:6\nI can seek the Lord and call upon Him.\nTo teach your children about\nIsaiah 55:6\n, you could hide a picture of Jesus somewhere in the room. You could invite your children to find the picture and name one way they can “seek … the Lord while he may be found.” A song like “\nSeek the Lord Early\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 108) could give them ideas. Then you could let one of the children hide the picture and repeat the activity.\nIsaiah 55:8–9\nThe Lord’s ways are higher than mine.\nAfter reading\nIsaiah 55:9\n, it might be fun for your children to stand on a stool and talk about how things look different when you are “higher.” Or they could draw a picture of what\nIsaiah 55:9\nmeans to them. You could then discuss some of the Lord’s ways that are higher than our ways. For example, what is His way of treating sinners? (see\nMark 2:15–17\n). What is His way of leading others? (see\nMatthew 20:25–28\n). Share with your children how you have learned to trust the Lord’s higher ways and thoughts.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n\n\n--- SEMINARY_TEACHER: Seminary Teacher Week 41: Lesson 123: Lesson 123—Isaiah 51–52This lesson can help students hearken unto the Savior’s invitations.; Lesson 124: Lesson 124—Isaiah 53This lesson can help students feel gratitude for what the Savior has done for them through His Atonement.... ---\n\n--- Lesson 123 ---\nThrough Isaiah, the Lord spoke to His covenant people, both anciently and today. He extended beautiful promises to them if they chose to hearken to His loving invitations. As His covenant people, the Lord extends these same promises and invitations to us. This lesson can help students hearken unto the Savior’s invitations. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder when they or someone they know obeyed one of the Lord’s invitations or commandments and were blessed. The lesson will provide an opportunity for willing students to share. Possible Learning Activities Who do you listen to? Consider listing on the board the individuals mentioned below or others you feel are influential for teenagers. Parent, Friend, Teacher, Coach, Social Media Influencer, Celebrity Who do you think teenagers are most likely to listen to and follow their counsel? Why? Why does it matter who we listen to and follow? As students read the following verses, you may want to point out that writers in scriptures often repeated key words and ideas to emphasize important ideas. Your students can practice finding repeated key words and phrases with the following verses. Read Isaiah 51:1, 4, 7 , looking for who the Lord counseled His covenant people to listen to and follow. You may want to mark what you find. Invite students to share what they found. If students need help understanding the word hearken , consider explaining that President Russell M. Nelson taught that to hearken means “to listen with the intent to obey” (“ Hear Him ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2020, 89). Why might someone want to listen to and follow the Savior’s counsel over anyone else? Ponder any challenges, worries, or questions you might have in your life right now. Consider ways you could benefit from hearkening to the Savior’s counsel and invitations as you study Isaiah 51–52 . “Hearken to me” Read Isaiah 51:1–2 , looking for images and symbols that Isaiah used to describe an invitation from the Lord. Invite students to share what they found and what they feel these images mean. Explain that the phrases to “look unto the rock whence ye are hewn” and to look unto Abraham and Sarah ( Isaiah 51:1–2 ) refer to the Lord’s invitation to remember Abraham and Sarah, with whom God made His covenant (also called the Abrahamic covenant). This implies that we should remember to keep this same covenant with God. You could invite students to write the following incomplete statement in their study journal: As we keep our covenants with the Lord, He will … What does it mean to you to keep our covenants with the Lord? Read Isaiah 51:3 , looking for the blessings the Savior promises if we hearken to Him to keep our covenants. What did you find? Students could add … bless us with comfort, joy, and gladness to the incomplete statement. How do you think keeping our covenants with the Lord helps us receive His comfort, joy, or gladness? Invitations and blessings Create or display the following chart on the board. Students could also copy it in their study journals. As a model, you may want to add what students discovered in Isaiah 51:1–3 . For example, you could add “keep our covenants with the Lord” to the left column and “bless us with comfort, joy, and gladness” to the right column. Isaiah recorded many invitations and promises from the Lord in Isaiah 51–52 . Record the invitations and promises you find in your journal as you study these chapters. The Lord’s Invitations to His covenant people The Lord’s Promises to His covenant people The Lord’s Invitations to His covenant people The Lord’s Promises to His covenant people The handout “The Lord’s Invitations and Promises to His Covenant People” can help students identify and understand the Lord’s invitations and blessings to us. One way to help students study the handout is to organize them into small groups. Each group could select a portion of the handout to study and prepare to share what they learned. After sufficient time has passed, organize the class into new groups with students who studied a different set of verses. Each student can then share what they learned with their new group. Open PDF As groups discuss what they discovered, invite them to add to the chart on the board. Consider discussing specific invitations or blessings that students found meaningful. Questions like the following can help: What do these invitations teach you about what it means to keep your covenants? Which of the Lord’s blessings do you really want? Why? Which of the Lord’s invitations do you think will help you receive the blessing you seek? As students respond, listen carefully to what they say and think of ways to involve more students in the discussion. When teachers resist the tendency to respond to every comment and question and instead invite the class to respond, they can help create a pattern where students respond to each other. This can help the focus stay on the learners and increase student participation. One way to do this could be by asking follow-up questions like: Who has an experience that relates to what has been shared? What impressed you about that comment? (For additional training on resisting the tendency to respond to every comment and question, see: “ Resist the tendency to respond to every comment and question and invite the class to respond ” in Teacher Development Skills ). Hearkening to the Lord Invite students to think about what they have learned from their Father in Heaven through the Holy Ghost during the lesson. The following is one way you could do this. Ponder what you learned today and any invitations or counsel you feel Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ extended to you through the Holy Ghost. In your study journal, consider answering the following question: What do you feel the Lord is inviting you to do to receive His help with your challenges, worries, or questions?\n\n\n--- Lesson 124 ---\nOur mortal difficulties may cause us to wonder if anyone understands what we’re experiencing and if anyone can help us. Through His atoning sacrifice, Jesus Christ felt everything we may experience in mortality. Because of His Atonement, Jesus Christ can help us in our suffering. This lesson can help students feel gratitude for what the Savior has done for them through His Atonement. Student preparation: Invite students to work on memorizing the doctrinal mastery reference Isaiah 53:3–5 and the key scripture phrase “Surely [Jesus Christ] hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.” Possible Learning Activities Life experiences To help students consider what Jesus Christ experienced for them as part of His Atonement, consider writing, “ No one knows what it is like. No one understands ,” on the board. What are some experiences people may have that could cause them to think this way? Consider writing students’ answers on the board. Allow time for several students to share. Then, display the following prompt and questions. Ponder your answers to the following questions: What experiences have I had or might I have that could cause me to think this way? What do I do when I feel this way? Why? Encourage students to invite the Holy Ghost into their study as they learn about what the Savior has experienced and how He can help them. The Savior’s Atonement Through His Atonement, Jesus Christ perfectly knows and understands our life experiences. In Isaiah 53 , the prophet Isaiah taught about Jesus Christ’s atoning sacrifice. Isaiah 53:3–5 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Students can receive comfort and deepen their relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ through personal study of Isaiah 53 . The following activity is one way you could have students study Isaiah 53 . Read Isaiah 53:1–12 and Alma 7:11–13 , looking for: What the Savior experienced as part of His Atonement, and What the Savior can do for me because of His Atonement. You might want to create two columns on a blank page in your study journal to record what you find. What the Savior experienced What the Savior can do for me Some of the words and phrases in Isaiah 53 may be difficult for students to understand. If so, you may want to display the accompanying handout titled “ Understanding Isaiah 53 ” or provide it for students to refer to as they study. Alternatively, you might invite students to use footnotes or a dictionary to clarify unfamiliar words or phrases. As students study Alma 7:12 , it may be helpful for them to know that succor can describe how the Savior cares for us. “To succor means to ‘run to’” (Jeffrey R. Holland, “ He Hath Filled the Hungry with Good Things ,” Ensign , Nov. 1997, 66). Open PDF After giving students sufficient time to study, organize them into small groups. Invite them to discuss and summarize what they learned from their study. A few groups could share their summaries with the class. Students could identify truths such as: As part of His Atonement, Jesus Christ took upon Himself our sorrows, pains, sicknesses, afflictions, and griefs, and suffered for our sins. Through Jesus Christ and His Atonement, we can be forgiven and healed. The Savior’s Atonement is for me Reread Isaiah 53:3–6 silently to yourself, but this time, substitute your name, I , or my for the words our , we , and us . What did you learn or what did you notice that you didn’t before by personalizing these verses? If students could benefit from additional study about how the Savior personally experienced our suffering as part of His Atonement, you could also have students study the following statement from Elder Bednar. Consider displaying the statement from Elder Bednar and inviting students to look for words or phrases in the statement that help them understand the Savior and His Atonement. Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught about how deeply personal the Savior’s sacrifice was: 16:23 There is no physical pain, no spiritual wound, no anguish of soul or heartache, no infirmity or weakness you or I ever confront in mortality that the Savior did not experience first. In a moment of weakness we may cry out, “No one knows what it is like. No one understands.” But the Son of God perfectly knows and understands, for He has felt and borne our individual burdens. And because of His infinite and eternal sacrifice (see Alma 34:14 ), He has perfect empathy and can extend to us His arm of mercy. He can reach out, touch, succor, heal, and strengthen us to be more than we could ever be and help us to do that which we could never do relying only upon our own power. (“ Bear Up Their Burdens with Ease ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2014, 90) What would you say to someone who feels no one understands what they are going through? Try using words or phrases from Isaiah 53 , Alma 7:11–13 , and the statement from Elder Bednar. Reflecting on the Savior’s Atonement The following questions can help students reflect on their gratitude for the Savior’s Atonement. Help students respond to the questions by giving them a few minutes to ponder or write their answers. Giving students time to ponder can help them reflect on their relationship with Jesus Christ. Consider playing quiet, sacred music as students ponder or write their thoughts. Using what you learned today about the Savior and His Atonement, how would you respond to the following questions: Why is Jesus Christ the best person to turn to when you experience sorrow, grief, or pain? How have you or someone you know felt the Savior’s comfort while experiencing sorrow, grief, or pain? Invite students to share what they’ve pondered. As they share experiences, be sensitive and encouraging. Hearing another’s experience could prepare students to share their own. Consider sharing a personal experience or watching “ He Will Give You Help ” (4:43), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . This video shows how a young man found help overcoming grief through Jesus Christ and His Atonement. 4:43 Thank students for sharing their thoughts and feelings. You might also share your thoughts and feelings about the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Isaiah 53:3–5 is “Surely [Jesus Christ] hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 125 ---\nPeople may feel forsaken and alone at times. Sometimes, people may think that God is not there for them. Because the house of Israel broke the covenant they made with Jehovah, they were scattered. They may have felt that God had forsaken them. However, through the prophet Isaiah, the Lord reminded His covenant people, both then and now, that He would gather them with great mercies and give them peace. This lesson can help students feel the Savior’s love and commitment to them. Student preparation: Invite students to read Isaiah 54 , looking for words and phrases they would share with someone who feels alone or forsaken. Possible Learning Activities Feeling forsaken Consider beginning class with the following scenario. Students could select a version of the scenario to focus on individually or one for the entire class. Students will have an opportunity to respond to the scenario they chose at the end of the lesson. Carlos feels alone and forsaken because … He has sinned and doesn’t believe that God will forgive him for what he has done. He recently moved into a new area and is having a hard time making friends. He doesn’t feel like his prayers are being answered. Think about what you might say to Carlos to help him. Reflect on what you would want him to know about Jesus Christ. You may also want to invite students to think about their circumstances and how they have responded if they have felt alone or forsaken. To help students understand the context of Isaiah 54 , you may want to show students the image, “The Kingdoms of Israel and Judah at a Glance” as you explain the following paragraph (see also Lesson 88: 2 Kings 17; 24–25 ). Open PDF During Isaiah’s life, he witnessed the scattering of the Northern Kingdom of Israel because of its wickedness (see 2 Kings 17:6–23 ). He also prophesied that because of the wickedness of the Southern Kingdom of Judah, it too would be conquered (see Isaiah 39:5–7 ). Because of this, many in the house of Israel may have felt forsaken by God. In Isaiah 54 , Isaiah prophesied about what the Lord would do for His covenant people. The Savior later used this chapter to teach the Nephites how He would gather Israel in the last days (see 3 Nephi 22 ). As you study Isaiah 54 , listen for promptings from the Holy Ghost to help you know how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ feel about Their relationship with you. The Lord’s promises to His people You may want to remind students that Isaiah often used imagery in his writings. Pausing to think about lessons learned from the imagery he included can invite the Holy Ghost to teach us the Lord’s message in these scriptures. In Isaiah 54 , Isaiah used the imagery of a marriage relationship to teach about the Lord’s covenant relationship with the house of Israel. The husband represents the Savior, and the wife represents the house of Israel. You may want to divide the reading of the next set of verses into smaller segments, such as verses 1–4, 5–8, 9–10, 13, 17 . To help students better understand what they are reading, you could pause after each set of verses and invite students to ask questions. You can find information on certain words and phrases in these verses in the Additional Resources section. Carefully read Isaiah 54:1–10, 13, 17 , looking for what Jesus Christ promised His covenant people. What does the imagery of a husband and wife teach you about the Lord’s relationship with the house of Israel? What do the names and titles of the Savior in verse 5 teach about Him? You may want to allocate time to allow students to share meaningful words and phrases from these verses and discuss what they teach about the Lord. They could do this as a class or in small groups. Write Jesus Christ our Redeemer … on the board and invite students to complete the statement using what they find in Isaiah 54:4–10, 13, 17 . What are some ways you could finish the statement Jesus Christ our Redeemer … ? Students may finish the statement in many ways, including: Jesus Christ our Redeemer … will gather His people in mercy. has everlasting kindness for His people. will fulfill the covenant He made with His people. promises peace. When students see the scriptures as relevant to their lives, they are more likely to understand how the Savior’s doctrine applies to them personally. The following questions, or others you may think of, can help them discuss the relevance of the truths they identified. Which of these truths do you think could most help youth today? Why? Reflect on which of these truths is most meaningful to you personally. How do you think Jesus Christ fulfills these promises today? President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles testified: … In a world “tossed with tempest, and not comforted,” as Jehovah said it would be, how do we find what He called “the covenant of … peace”? We find it by turning to Him who said He would have mercy on us and “with everlasting kindness” would grant peace to our children. (“ Not as the World Giveth ,” Liahona , May 2021, 36) What are you learning about the way Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ feel toward you? To help students see an example of how the Lord gathers His people in mercy and helps them feel like they belong in His Church, consider watching the video “ Angels in the Mirror ” (5:47), located at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Afterward, invite students to share what impressed them. 5:46 Demonstrate learning The following activity intends to help students demonstrate what they learned and felt about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from studying Isaiah 54 . Select a method of responding that best meets the needs of your class. Some examples of what you could do include inviting students to role-play the situation, write a text message to send, or create a comic strip of a conversation with Carlos. Recall why Carlos feels forsaken and alone. Think of what you could share with him from what you learned in Isaiah 54 . Are there any personal experiences you might share with him? What do you want to remember about the Savior from your study of Isaiah 54 ? You may also want to share your testimony of the Savior and your thoughts and feelings while studying Isaiah 54 .\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 50 ---\n1.

For themothshall eat them up like garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.\n9. Awake, awake, put onstrength, O arm of theLord; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old.Artthou not it that hath cut Rahab,andwounded thedragon?\n10. Artthou not it which hathdriedthe sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea awayfor theransomedto pass over?\n11. Therefore theredeemedof theLordshallreturn, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlastingjoyshall beupon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy;andsorrow andmourningshall flee away.\n12. I,evenI,amhe that comforteth you: whoartthou, that thou shouldest beafraidof manthatshall die, and of the son of manwhichshall be madeasgrass;\n13. AndforgettesttheLordthy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of theearth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and whereisthe fury of the oppressor?\n14. The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in thepit, nor that his bread should fail.\n15. But IamtheLordthy God, that divided thesea, whose waves roared: TheLordof hostsishis name.\n16. And I have put mywordsin thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thouartmy people.\n17. Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of theLordthecupof hisfury; thou hast drunken the dregs of thecupof trembling,andwrungthemout.\n18. There isnone to guide her among all the sonswhomshe hath brought forth; neitheris there anythat taketh her by the hand of all the sonsthatshe hath brought up.\n19. Thesetwothingsare come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?\n20. Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as awild bullin net: they are full of the fury of theLord, the rebuke of thy God.\n21. Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:\n22. Thus saith thy Lord theLord, and thy Godthatpleadeththe cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling,eventhe dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:\n23. But I will put it into thehandof them thatafflictthee; which have said to thy soul,Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 52 ---\n1. Awake, awake; put on thystrength, OZion; put on thybeautifulgarments, OJerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.\n2. Shakethyself from the dust;arise,andsit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from thebandsof thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.\n3. For thus saith theLord, Ye havesoldyourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed withoutmoney.\n4. For thus saith the LordGod, My people went down aforetime intoEgyptto sojourn there; and theAssyrian oppressed them without cause.\n5. Now therefore, what have I here, saith theLord, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith theLord; and my name continually every dayisblasphemed.\n6. Therefore my people shall know my name: thereforethey shall knowin thatdaythat Iamhe that doth speak: behold,it isI.\n7. Howbeautifulupon the mountains are the feet of him thatbringethgoodtidings, thatpublishethpeace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith untoZion, Thy God reigneth!\n8. Thywatchmenshall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shallseeeye to eye, when theLordshall bring againZion.\n9. Break forth into joy, sing together, yewaste placesof Jerusalem: for theLordhath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.\n10. TheLordhath madebarehis holyarmin the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shallseethesalvationof our God.\n11. Depart ye, depart ye, go yeoutfrom thence,touchnouncleanthing;go yeoutof the midst of her; be yeclean, that bear the vessels of theLord.\n12. For ye shall not go out withhaste, nor go by flight: for theLordwill go before you; and the God of Israelwill beyourrearward.\n13. Behold, myservantshall dealprudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.\n14. As many wereastoniedat thee; hisvisagewas so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:\n15. So shall hesprinklemany nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: forthatwhich had not beentoldthem shall they see; andthatwhich they had not heard shall they consider.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 53 ---\n1. Who hathbelievedour report? and to whom is the arm of theLordrevealed?\n2. For he shall grow up before him as tenderplant, and as arootout of adryground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him,there isnobeautythat we should desire him.\n3. He isdespisedand rejected ofmen; man ofsorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it wereourfaces from him; he was despised, and weesteemedhim not.\n4. Surely he hathborneourgriefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.\n5. But hewaswoundedfor ourtransgressions,he wasbruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peacewasupon him; and with hisstripeswe arehealed.\n6. All we likesheephave goneastray; we have turned every one to hisownway; and theLordhath laid on him theiniquityof us all.\n7. He wasoppressed, and he wasafflicted, yet heopenednot his mouth: he is brought as alambto theslaughter, and as sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.\n8. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare hisgeneration? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for thetransgressionof my people was he stricken.\n9. And he made his grave with thewicked, and with the rich in hisdeath;becausehe had done noviolence, neitherwas anydeceitin his mouth.\n10. Yet it pleased theLordtobruisehim; he hath puthimto grief: when thou shalt make his soul anofferingfor sin, he shall seehisseed, he shall prolonghisdays, and thepleasureof theLordshall prosper in his hand.\n11. He shall see of the travail of his soul,andshall be satisfied: by hisknowledgeshall my righteousservantjustifymany; for he shallbeartheir iniquities.\n12. Therefore will I divide hima portionwith the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul untodeath: and he was numbered with thetransgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and madeintercessionfor the transgressors.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 54 ---\n1. Sing, Obarren, thouthatdidst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thouthatdidst not travail with child: for morearethe children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith theLord.\n2. Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtainsof thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thystakes;\n3. For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.\n4. Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget theshameof thy youth, and shalt not remember thereproachof thy widowhood any more.\n5. For thy Makeristhinehusband; theLordof hostsishis name; and thyRedeemerthe Holy One of Israel; TheGodof the whole earth shall he be called.\n6. For theLordhath called thee as awomanforsakenand grieved in spirit, and awifeof youth,when thou wast refused, saith thy God.\n7. For smallmomenthave Iforsakenthee; but with great mercies will Igatherthee.\n8. In littlewrathIhidmyfacefrom thee for moment; but with everlastingkindnesswill I havemercyon thee, saith theLordthy Redeemer.\n9. For thisis asthe waters of Noah unto me: forasI have sworn that thewaters of Noahshould no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.\n10. For themountainsshall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall thecovenantof my peace be removed, saith theLordthat hath mercy on thee.\n11. O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest,andnot comforted, behold, I will lay thystoneswith fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.\n12. And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.\n13. And all thychildrenshall betaughtof theLord; and greatshall bethepeaceof thy children.\n14. In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.\n15. Behold, they shall surely gather together,butnot by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.\n16. Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created thewasterto destroy.\n17. Noweaponthat is formed against thee shall prosper; and everytonguethatshall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. Thisisthe heritage of theservantsof theLord, and their righteousnessisof me, saith theLord.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 55 ---\n1. Ho, every one thatthirsteth, come ye to thewaters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come,buywine and milk without money and withoutprice.\n2. Wherefore do yespendmoney forthat which isnot bread? and yourlabourforthat whichsatisfieth not? hearkendiligentlyunto me, and eat yethat which isgood, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.\n3. Incline your ear, andcomeunto me: hear, and yoursoulshall live; and I will make an everlastingcovenantwith you,eventhesuremercies of David.\n4. Behold, I have given himforawitnessto the people, aleaderand commander to the people.\n5. Behold, thou shalt call nationthatthou knowest not, andnationsthatknew not thee shall run unto thee because of theLordthy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.\n6. Seekye theLordwhile he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:\n7. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let himreturnunto theLord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantlypardon.\n8. For mythoughtsarenotyourthoughts, neitherareyourwaysmyways, saith theLord.\n9. Forasthe heavens are higher than the earth, so are mywayshigherthan your ways, and mythoughtsthan your thoughts.\n10. For as theraincometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, andbreadto the eater:\n11. So shall mywordbe that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosperin the thingwhereto I sent it.\n12. For ye shall go out withjoy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all thetreesof the field shall claptheirhands.\n13. Instead of the thorn shall come up thefir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to theLordfor name, for an everlasting signthatshall not be cut off.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 56 ---\n1. Thus saith theLord, Keep ye judgment, and dojustice: for my salvationisnearto come, and my righteousness to be revealed.\n2. Blessedisthe manthatdoeth this, and the son of manthatlayeth holdon it; that keepeth thesabbathfrom polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing anyevil.\n3. Neither let thesonof thestranger, that hath joined himself to theLord, speak, saying, TheLordhath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, Iama dry tree.\n4. For thus saith theLordunto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choosethe thingsthat please me, and take hold of my covenant;\n5. Even unto them will I give in minehouseand within my walls place and name better than ofsonsand of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.\n6. Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to theLord, to serve him, and to love the name of theLord, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;\n7. Even them will I bring to my holymountain, and make them joyful in myhouseofprayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrificesshall beacceptedupon mine altar; for minehouseshall be called an house of prayer forallpeople.\n8. The LordGodwhichgathereththe outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gatherothersto him, beside those that are gathered unto him.\n9. Allye beasts of the field, come to devour,yea,all ye beasts in the forest.\n10. Hiswatchmenareblind: they are all ignorant, theyareall dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.\n11. Yea,they aregreedydogswhichcan never have enough, and theyareshepherdsthatcannot understand: they all look to theirownway, every one for his gain, from his quarter.\n12. Come ye,say they,I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day,andmuch more abundant.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 57 ---\n1. The righteousperisheth, and no man layethitto heart: and merciful menaretaken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evilto come.\n2. He shall enter intopeace: they shall rest in their beds,each onewalkinginhis uprightness.\n3. But draw near hither, yesonsof the sorceress, the seed of theadultererand the whore.\n4. Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye wide mouth,anddraw out the tongue?areye notchildrenof transgression, seed of falsehood,\n5.

Among the smoothstonesof the streamisthy portion; they, theyarethy lot: even to them hast thou poured drink offering, thou hastoffered meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?\n7. Upon lofty and high mountain hast thou set thybed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.\n8. Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hastdiscoveredthyself toanotherthan me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made theea covenantwith them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawestit.\n9. And thou wentest to thekingwith ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debasethyself evenunto hell.\n10. Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way;yetsaidst thou not, There is nohope: thou hast found thelife of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.\n11. And of whom hast thou been afraid orfeared, that thou hastlied, and hast not remembered me, nor laiditto thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?\n12. I willdeclarethy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.\n13. When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall takethem:but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holymountain;\n14.

      "content": "Throughout his ministry, Isaiah spoke of a mighty deliverer. These prophecies would have been especially precious to the Israelites centuries later when they were in captivity in Babylon. Someone who could tear down the walls of Babylon would be a mighty conqueror indeed. But that isn’t the kind of Messiah that Isaiah described in\nchapters 52–53\n: “He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him. … We did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted” (\nIsaiah 53:3–4\n).\nBy sending such an unexpected deliverer, God taught us about true deliverance. To save us from oppression and affliction, God sent One who Himself “was oppressed, and … afflicted.” Where some expected a lion, He sent a lamb (see\nIsaiah 53:7\n). Surely, God’s ways are not our ways (see\nIsaiah 55:8–9\n). Jesus Christ frees us not by just opening the prison but by taking our place there. He relieves us from our chains of grief and sorrow by bearing them Himself (see\nIsaiah 53:4–5, 12\n). He does not save us from a distance. He suffers with us, in acts of “everlasting kindness” that “shall not depart from thee” (\nIsaiah 54:8, 10\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 50–52\nThe future is bright for the Lord’s people.\nEven though the Israelites spent many years in captivity—and even though that captivity was a result of their own poor choices—the Lord wanted them to look to the future with hope. What do you find in Isaiah’s message that gives you hope? A chart like this one might help you study:\nWhat I learn about God\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:2, 5–9\n;\n51:3–8, 15–16\n;\n52:3, 9–10\n)\nMessages of hope\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:9\n;\n51:3–5, 11–12, 22–23\n;\n52:9–10\n)\nWhat I can do to make hope a reality\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:10\n;\n51:1–2, 6–9\n;\n52:1–3, 9–11\n)\nSee also\nMosiah 12:20–24\n;\n15:13–18\n;\n3 Nephi 20:29–46\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 113:7–10\n; Russell M. Nelson, “\nEmbrace the Future with Faith\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 73–76.\nBecause of Love\n, by Angela Johnson\nHelp learners come unto Jesus Christ.\n“Nothing you do as a teacher will bless learners more than helping them know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and feel Their love” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n8\n). As you prepare to teach\nIsaiah 50–57\nto others, consider how you can help them see connections between Israel’s challenges, Isaiah’s prophecies of Christ, and receiving divine help with their own struggles.\nIsaiah 53\nJesus Christ took upon Himself my sins and sorrows.\nFew chapters in scripture describe Jesus Christ’s redemptive mission more beautifully than\nIsaiah 53\n. Consider activities like these to better understand and apply these powerful teachings:\nPonder or discuss how stories and movies often depict heroes who rescue people. Contrast those depictions with the descriptions of the Savior in\nIsaiah 53\n.\nAfter reading each verse, pause to contemplate what the Savior suffered—the “griefs,” “sorrows,” and “transgressions” He bore—for all people and specifically for you. You might replace words like “we” and “our” with “I” and “my” as you read. What feelings or thoughts do these verses inspire in you?\nConsider watching the video “My Kingdom Is Not of This World” (Gospel Library), and ponder how the prophecies in\nIsaiah 53\nwere fulfilled. What are some of the griefs and sorrows the Savior carries for you?\n5:25\nMy Kingdom Is Not of This World\nFind pictures of the events surrounding the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 56–60\n). You could then find phrases in\nIsaiah 53\nthat describe the events in the pictures. What do these teachings inspire you to do?\nSee also “\nBehold the Great Redeemer Die\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 191.\nIsaiah 54\n;\n57:15–19\nJesus Christ wants me to return to Him.\nWe all have times when we feel distant from the Lord because of our sins or weaknesses. Some have even given up hope that He will ever forgive them.\nIsaiah 54\nand\n57\nare great chapters to read for reassurance and encouragement during such times. Particularly in\nIsaiah 54:4–10\n;\n57:15–19\n, what words teach you how the Savior feels about you? What difference does it make in your life to know these things about Him?\nPresident Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:\n“It matters not how completely ruined our lives may seem. It matters not how scarlet our sins, how deep our bitterness, how lonely, abandoned, or broken our hearts may be. Even those who are without hope, who live in despair, who have betrayed trust, surrendered their integrity, or turned away from God can be rebuilt. …\n“The joyous news of the gospel is this: because of the eternal plan of happiness provided by our loving Heavenly Father and through the infinite sacrifice of Jesus the Christ, we can not only be redeemed from our fallen state and restored to purity, but we can also transcend mortal imagination and become heirs of eternal life and partakers of God’s indescribable glory” (“\nHe Will Place You on His Shoulders and Carry You Home\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 102).\nSee also Patrick Kearon, “\nGod’s Intent Is to Bring You Home\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 87–89.\nIsaiah 55–56\nThe Lord invites all to “take hold of my covenant.”\nFor generations, Israel had been identified as God’s covenant people. However, God’s plan has always included more than just one nation, for “every one that thirsteth” is invited to “come … to the waters” (\nIsaiah 55:1\n). Keep this in mind as you read\nIsaiah 55\nand\n56\n, and ponder what it means to be God’s people. What is God’s message to those who feel “utterly separated” from Him? (\nIsaiah 56:3\n). Consider marking verses that describe attitudes and actions of those who “take hold of my covenant” (see\nIsaiah 56:4–7\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nIsaiah 51–52\nThe Lord invites me to “put on [my] strength.”\nIt might be fun for your children to discover phrases like “awake,” “stand up,” and “put on thy strength” in\nIsaiah 51:9, 17\n;\n52:1–2, 9\nand then act out those phrases. After doing so, you could talk about what it means to awake, stand up, and put on strength spiritually. What is the Lord asking us to do in these verses?\nYour children could also read\nIsaiah 51:1, 4, 7\nand identify who the Lord is speaking to and what He wants them to do. What does it mean to “hearken unto” the Lord? How can we show the Lord that we “hearken unto” Him?\nIsaiah 53:3–9\nJesus Christ took upon Himself my sins and sorrows.\nYou and your children could look at several pictures showing the suffering and death of Jesus Christ (see, for example,\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n56\n,\n57\n,\n58\n). Then you could read together\nIsaiah 53:3–6, 9\nand look for words that describe what is happening in the pictures. Help your children understand that Isaiah shared these truths hundreds of years before they happened. Why would it be important for people to know these things so many years in advance? (see\nAlma 39:15–19\n).\nAfter reading from\nIsaiah 53:4\n, “He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,” your children could try to lift a heavy object (or pretend to lift one). Talk about how “grief” and “sorrow” or sadness can feel heavy and hard to carry. Why did Jesus carry our “griefs,” “sorrows,” and “iniquities” or sins? (see also\nAlma 7:11–12\n).\nIsaiah 55:6\nI can seek the Lord and call upon Him.\nTo teach your children about\nIsaiah 55:6\n, you could hide a picture of Jesus somewhere in the room. You could invite your children to find the picture and name one way they can “seek … the Lord while he may be found.” A song like “\nSeek the Lord Early\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 108) could give them ideas. Then you could let one of the children hide the picture and repeat the activity.\nIsaiah 55:8–9\nThe Lord’s ways are higher than mine.\nAfter reading\nIsaiah 55:9\n, it might be fun for your children to stand on a stool and talk about how things look different when you are “higher.” Or they could draw a picture of what\nIsaiah 55:9\nmeans to them. You could then discuss some of the Lord’s ways that are higher than our ways. For example, what is His way of treating sinners? (see\nMark 2:15–17\n). What is His way of leading others? (see\nMatthew 20:25–28\n). Share with your children how you have learned to trust the Lord’s higher ways and thoughts.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n",

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 123 ---\nThrough Isaiah, the Lord spoke to His covenant people, both anciently and today. He extended beautiful promises to them if they chose to hearken to His loving invitations. As His covenant people, the Lord extends these same promises and invitations to us. This lesson can help students hearken unto the Savior’s invitations. Student preparation: Invite students to ponder when they or someone they know obeyed one of the Lord’s invitations or commandments and were blessed. The lesson will provide an opportunity for willing students to share. Possible Learning Activities Who do you listen to? Consider listing on the board the individuals mentioned below or others you feel are influential for teenagers. Parent, Friend, Teacher, Coach, Social Media Influencer, Celebrity Who do you think teenagers are most likely to listen to and follow their counsel? Why? Why does it matter who we listen to and follow? As students read the following verses, you may want to point out that writers in scriptures often repeated key words and ideas to emphasize important ideas. Your students can practice finding repeated key words and phrases with the following verses. Read Isaiah 51:1, 4, 7 , looking for who the Lord counseled His covenant people to listen to and follow. You may want to mark what you find. Invite students to share what they found. If students need help understanding the word hearken , consider explaining that President Russell M. Nelson taught that to hearken means “to listen with the intent to obey” (“ Hear Him ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2020, 89). Why might someone want to listen to and follow the Savior’s counsel over anyone else? Ponder any challenges, worries, or questions you might have in your life right now. Consider ways you could benefit from hearkening to the Savior’s counsel and invitations as you study Isaiah 51–52 . “Hearken to me” Read Isaiah 51:1–2 , looking for images and symbols that Isaiah used to describe an invitation from the Lord. Invite students to share what they found and what they feel these images mean. Explain that the phrases to “look unto the rock whence ye are hewn” and to look unto Abraham and Sarah ( Isaiah 51:1–2 ) refer to the Lord’s invitation to remember Abraham and Sarah, with whom God made His covenant (also called the Abrahamic covenant). This implies that we should remember to keep this same covenant with God. You could invite students to write the following incomplete statement in their study journal: As we keep our covenants with the Lord, He will … What does it mean to you to keep our covenants with the Lord? Read Isaiah 51:3 , looking for the blessings the Savior promises if we hearken to Him to keep our covenants. What did you find? Students could add … bless us with comfort, joy, and gladness to the incomplete statement. How do you think keeping our covenants with the Lord helps us receive His comfort, joy, or gladness? Invitations and blessings Create or display the following chart on the board. Students could also copy it in their study journals. As a model, you may want to add what students discovered in Isaiah 51:1–3 . For example, you could add “keep our covenants with the Lord” to the left column and “bless us with comfort, joy, and gladness” to the right column. Isaiah recorded many invitations and promises from the Lord in Isaiah 51–52 . Record the invitations and promises you find in your journal as you study these chapters. The Lord’s Invitations to His covenant people The Lord’s Promises to His covenant people The Lord’s Invitations to His covenant people The Lord’s Promises to His covenant people The handout “The Lord’s Invitations and Promises to His Covenant People” can help students identify and understand the Lord’s invitations and blessings to us. One way to help students study the handout is to organize them into small groups. Each group could select a portion of the handout to study and prepare to share what they learned. After sufficient time has passed, organize the class into new groups with students who studied a different set of verses. Each student can then share what they learned with their new group. Open PDF As groups discuss what they discovered, invite them to add to the chart on the board. Consider discussing specific invitations or blessings that students found meaningful. Questions like the following can help: What do these invitations teach you about what it means to keep your covenants? Which of the Lord’s blessings do you really want? Why? Which of the Lord’s invitations do you think will help you receive the blessing you seek? As students respond, listen carefully to what they say and think of ways to involve more students in the discussion. When teachers resist the tendency to respond to every comment and question and instead invite the class to respond, they can help create a pattern where students respond to each other. This can help the focus stay on the learners and increase student participation. One way to do this could be by asking follow-up questions like: Who has an experience that relates to what has been shared? What impressed you about that comment? (For additional training on resisting the tendency to respond to every comment and question, see: “ Resist the tendency to respond to every comment and question and invite the class to respond ” in Teacher Development Skills ). Hearkening to the Lord Invite students to think about what they have learned from their Father in Heaven through the Holy Ghost during the lesson. The following is one way you could do this. Ponder what you learned today and any invitations or counsel you feel Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ extended to you through the Holy Ghost. In your study journal, consider answering the following question: What do you feel the Lord is inviting you to do to receive His help with your challenges, worries, or questions?\n\n\n--- Lesson 124 ---\nOur mortal difficulties may cause us to wonder if anyone understands what we’re experiencing and if anyone can help us. Through His atoning sacrifice, Jesus Christ felt everything we may experience in mortality. Because of His Atonement, Jesus Christ can help us in our suffering. This lesson can help students feel gratitude for what the Savior has done for them through His Atonement. Student preparation: Invite students to work on memorizing the doctrinal mastery reference Isaiah 53:3–5 and the key scripture phrase “Surely [Jesus Christ] hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.” Possible Learning Activities Life experiences To help students consider what Jesus Christ experienced for them as part of His Atonement, consider writing, “ No one knows what it is like. No one understands ,” on the board. What are some experiences people may have that could cause them to think this way? Consider writing students’ answers on the board. Allow time for several students to share. Then, display the following prompt and questions. Ponder your answers to the following questions: What experiences have I had or might I have that could cause me to think this way? What do I do when I feel this way? Why? Encourage students to invite the Holy Ghost into their study as they learn about what the Savior has experienced and how He can help them. The Savior’s Atonement Through His Atonement, Jesus Christ perfectly knows and understands our life experiences. In Isaiah 53 , the prophet Isaiah taught about Jesus Christ’s atoning sacrifice. Isaiah 53:3–5 is a doctrinal mastery passage. Consider inviting students to mark doctrinal mastery passages in a distinctive way so they can locate them easily. Students can receive comfort and deepen their relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ through personal study of Isaiah 53 . The following activity is one way you could have students study Isaiah 53 . Read Isaiah 53:1–12 and Alma 7:11–13 , looking for: What the Savior experienced as part of His Atonement, and What the Savior can do for me because of His Atonement. You might want to create two columns on a blank page in your study journal to record what you find. What the Savior experienced What the Savior can do for me Some of the words and phrases in Isaiah 53 may be difficult for students to understand. If so, you may want to display the accompanying handout titled “ Understanding Isaiah 53 ” or provide it for students to refer to as they study. Alternatively, you might invite students to use footnotes or a dictionary to clarify unfamiliar words or phrases. As students study Alma 7:12 , it may be helpful for them to know that succor can describe how the Savior cares for us. “To succor means to ‘run to’” (Jeffrey R. Holland, “ He Hath Filled the Hungry with Good Things ,” Ensign , Nov. 1997, 66). Open PDF After giving students sufficient time to study, organize them into small groups. Invite them to discuss and summarize what they learned from their study. A few groups could share their summaries with the class. Students could identify truths such as: As part of His Atonement, Jesus Christ took upon Himself our sorrows, pains, sicknesses, afflictions, and griefs, and suffered for our sins. Through Jesus Christ and His Atonement, we can be forgiven and healed. The Savior’s Atonement is for me Reread Isaiah 53:3–6 silently to yourself, but this time, substitute your name, I , or my for the words our , we , and us . What did you learn or what did you notice that you didn’t before by personalizing these verses? If students could benefit from additional study about how the Savior personally experienced our suffering as part of His Atonement, you could also have students study the following statement from Elder Bednar. Consider displaying the statement from Elder Bednar and inviting students to look for words or phrases in the statement that help them understand the Savior and His Atonement. Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught about how deeply personal the Savior’s sacrifice was: 16:23 There is no physical pain, no spiritual wound, no anguish of soul or heartache, no infirmity or weakness you or I ever confront in mortality that the Savior did not experience first. In a moment of weakness we may cry out, “No one knows what it is like. No one understands.” But the Son of God perfectly knows and understands, for He has felt and borne our individual burdens. And because of His infinite and eternal sacrifice (see Alma 34:14 ), He has perfect empathy and can extend to us His arm of mercy. He can reach out, touch, succor, heal, and strengthen us to be more than we could ever be and help us to do that which we could never do relying only upon our own power. (“ Bear Up Their Burdens with Ease ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2014, 90) What would you say to someone who feels no one understands what they are going through? Try using words or phrases from Isaiah 53 , Alma 7:11–13 , and the statement from Elder Bednar. Reflecting on the Savior’s Atonement The following questions can help students reflect on their gratitude for the Savior’s Atonement. Help students respond to the questions by giving them a few minutes to ponder or write their answers. Giving students time to ponder can help them reflect on their relationship with Jesus Christ. Consider playing quiet, sacred music as students ponder or write their thoughts. Using what you learned today about the Savior and His Atonement, how would you respond to the following questions: Why is Jesus Christ the best person to turn to when you experience sorrow, grief, or pain? How have you or someone you know felt the Savior’s comfort while experiencing sorrow, grief, or pain? Invite students to share what they’ve pondered. As they share experiences, be sensitive and encouraging. Hearing another’s experience could prepare students to share their own. Consider sharing a personal experience or watching “ He Will Give You Help ” (4:43), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . This video shows how a young man found help overcoming grief through Jesus Christ and His Atonement. 4:43 Thank students for sharing their thoughts and feelings. You might also share your thoughts and feelings about the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Memorize You may want to help students memorize the doctrinal mastery reference and key scripture phrase during this lesson and review them in future lessons. The key scripture phrase for Isaiah 53:3–5 is “Surely [Jesus Christ] hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.” Ideas for memorization activities are in the appendix materials under “ Doctrinal Mastery Review Activities .”\n\n\n--- Lesson 125 ---\nPeople may feel forsaken and alone at times. Sometimes, people may think that God is not there for them. Because the house of Israel broke the covenant they made with Jehovah, they were scattered. They may have felt that God had forsaken them. However, through the prophet Isaiah, the Lord reminded His covenant people, both then and now, that He would gather them with great mercies and give them peace. This lesson can help students feel the Savior’s love and commitment to them. Student preparation: Invite students to read Isaiah 54 , looking for words and phrases they would share with someone who feels alone or forsaken. Possible Learning Activities Feeling forsaken Consider beginning class with the following scenario. Students could select a version of the scenario to focus on individually or one for the entire class. Students will have an opportunity to respond to the scenario they chose at the end of the lesson. Carlos feels alone and forsaken because … He has sinned and doesn’t believe that God will forgive him for what he has done. He recently moved into a new area and is having a hard time making friends. He doesn’t feel like his prayers are being answered. Think about what you might say to Carlos to help him. Reflect on what you would want him to know about Jesus Christ. You may also want to invite students to think about their circumstances and how they have responded if they have felt alone or forsaken. To help students understand the context of Isaiah 54 , you may want to show students the image, “The Kingdoms of Israel and Judah at a Glance” as you explain the following paragraph (see also Lesson 88: 2 Kings 17; 24–25 ). Open PDF During Isaiah’s life, he witnessed the scattering of the Northern Kingdom of Israel because of its wickedness (see 2 Kings 17:6–23 ). He also prophesied that because of the wickedness of the Southern Kingdom of Judah, it too would be conquered (see Isaiah 39:5–7 ). Because of this, many in the house of Israel may have felt forsaken by God. In Isaiah 54 , Isaiah prophesied about what the Lord would do for His covenant people. The Savior later used this chapter to teach the Nephites how He would gather Israel in the last days (see 3 Nephi 22 ). As you study Isaiah 54 , listen for promptings from the Holy Ghost to help you know how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ feel about Their relationship with you. The Lord’s promises to His people You may want to remind students that Isaiah often used imagery in his writings. Pausing to think about lessons learned from the imagery he included can invite the Holy Ghost to teach us the Lord’s message in these scriptures. In Isaiah 54 , Isaiah used the imagery of a marriage relationship to teach about the Lord’s covenant relationship with the house of Israel. The husband represents the Savior, and the wife represents the house of Israel. You may want to divide the reading of the next set of verses into smaller segments, such as verses 1–4, 5–8, 9–10, 13, 17 . To help students better understand what they are reading, you could pause after each set of verses and invite students to ask questions. You can find information on certain words and phrases in these verses in the Additional Resources section. Carefully read Isaiah 54:1–10, 13, 17 , looking for what Jesus Christ promised His covenant people. What does the imagery of a husband and wife teach you about the Lord’s relationship with the house of Israel? What do the names and titles of the Savior in verse 5 teach about Him? You may want to allocate time to allow students to share meaningful words and phrases from these verses and discuss what they teach about the Lord. They could do this as a class or in small groups. Write Jesus Christ our Redeemer … on the board and invite students to complete the statement using what they find in Isaiah 54:4–10, 13, 17 . What are some ways you could finish the statement Jesus Christ our Redeemer … ? Students may finish the statement in many ways, including: Jesus Christ our Redeemer … will gather His people in mercy. has everlasting kindness for His people. will fulfill the covenant He made with His people. promises peace. When students see the scriptures as relevant to their lives, they are more likely to understand how the Savior’s doctrine applies to them personally. The following questions, or others you may think of, can help them discuss the relevance of the truths they identified. Which of these truths do you think could most help youth today? Why? Reflect on which of these truths is most meaningful to you personally. How do you think Jesus Christ fulfills these promises today? President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles testified: … In a world “tossed with tempest, and not comforted,” as Jehovah said it would be, how do we find what He called “the covenant of … peace”? We find it by turning to Him who said He would have mercy on us and “with everlasting kindness” would grant peace to our children. (“ Not as the World Giveth ,” Liahona , May 2021, 36) What are you learning about the way Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ feel toward you? To help students see an example of how the Lord gathers His people in mercy and helps them feel like they belong in His Church, consider watching the video “ Angels in the Mirror ” (5:47), located at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Afterward, invite students to share what impressed them. 5:46 Demonstrate learning The following activity intends to help students demonstrate what they learned and felt about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from studying Isaiah 54 . Select a method of responding that best meets the needs of your class. Some examples of what you could do include inviting students to role-play the situation, write a text message to send, or create a comic strip of a conversation with Carlos. Recall why Carlos feels forsaken and alone. Think of what you could share with him from what you learned in Isaiah 54 . Are there any personal experiences you might share with him? What do you want to remember about the Savior from your study of Isaiah 54 ? You may also want to share your testimony of the Savior and your thoughts and feelings while studying Isaiah 54 .",

Even unto them will I give in minehouseand within my walls place and name better than ofsonsand of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.\n6. Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to theLord, to serve him, and to love the name of theLord, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;\n7. Even them will I bring to my holymountain, and make them joyful in myhouseofprayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrificesshall beacceptedupon mine altar; for minehouseshall be called an house of prayer forallpeople.\n8. The LordGodwhichgathereththe outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gatherothersto him, beside those that are gathered unto him.\n9. Allye beasts of the field, come to devour,yea,all ye beasts in the forest.\n10. Hiswatchmenareblind: they are all ignorant, theyareall dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.\n11. Yea,they aregreedydogswhichcan never have enough, and theyareshepherdsthatcannot understand: they all look to theirownway, every one for his gain, from his quarter.\n12. Come ye,say they,I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day,andmuch more abundant.",

He shall enter intopeace: they shall rest in their beds,each onewalkinginhis uprightness.\n3. But draw near hither, yesonsof the sorceress, the seed of theadultererand the whore.\n4. Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye wide mouth,anddraw out the tongue?areye notchildrenof transgression, seed of falsehood,\n5. Enflaming yourselves withidolsunder every green tree,slayingthechildrenin the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?\n6. Among the smoothstonesof the streamisthy portion; they, theyarethy lot: even to them hast thou poured drink offering, thou hastoffered meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?\n7. Upon lofty and high mountain hast thou set thybed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.\n8. Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hastdiscoveredthyself toanotherthan me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made theea covenantwith them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawestit.\n9. And thou wentest to thekingwith ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debasethyself evenunto hell.\n10. Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way;yetsaidst thou not, There is nohope: thou hast found thelife of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.\n11. And of whom hast thou been afraid orfeared, that thou hastlied, and hast not remembered me, nor laiditto thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?\n12. I willdeclarethy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.\n13. When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall takethem:but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holymountain;\n14. And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up,preparethe way, take up thestumblingblockout of the way of my people.\n15. For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabitetheternity, whose nameisHoly; I dwell in the high and holyplace,with him alsothat isof acontriteandhumblespirit, torevivethe spirit of thehumble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\n16. For I will notcontendfor ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and thesoulswhichI have made.\n17. For theiniquityof hiscovetousnesswas I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went onfrowardlyin the way of his heart.\n18. I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I willleadhim also, and restorecomfortsunto him and to hismourners.\n19. I create thefruitof the lips; Peace, peace tohim that isfaroff, and tohim that isnear, saith theLord; and I will heal him.\n20. But thewickedarelike the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.\n21. There isnopeace, saith my God, to the wicked.",
