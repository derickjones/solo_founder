Would Abraham and Sarah prove faithful? Would they continue to have faith in God’s promise of a large posterity, even when they were still childless in their old age? And once Isaac was born, would their faith endure the unthinkable—a command to sacrifice the very son through whom God had promised to fulfill that covenant?\nAbraham and Sarah trusted God, and He trusted them (see\nGenesis 15:6\n;\nRomans 4:3\n). In\nGenesis 18–23\n, we find stories from the lives of Abraham, Sarah, and others that can prompt us to think about our own willingness to believe God’s promises, to flee wickedness and never look back, and to trust God regardless of the sacrifice. In proving us, God also improves us.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 18:9–14\n;\n21:1–7\nThe Lord fulfills His promises in His own time.\nThe Lord has made glorious promises to the faithful, but sometimes the circumstances of our lives can cause us to wonder how these promises can possibly be fulfilled. Abraham and Sarah may have felt that way. What do you learn from their experiences? It may be helpful to begin your study by reviewing what the Lord had promised in\nGenesis 17:4, 15–22\n. How did Abraham and Sarah react? (see\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 17:23\n[in\nGenesis 17:17\n, footnote\nb\n];\nGenesis 18:9–12\n). How did the Lord respond to help them have greater faith in His promises? (see\nGenesis 18:14\n).\nWhat do you find in these verses that builds your faith? What other experiences—in your life or someone else’s—have strengthened your faith that the Lord will fulfill His promises in His own time and way? You might also ponder how you can sustain your faith when promised blessings are\nnot\nreceived in this life. What counsel do you find in\nHebrews 11:8–13\nand President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nChrist Is Risen; Faith in Him Will Move Mountains\n”? (\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 101–4).\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 88:68\n.\nGenesis 19:12–29\nThe Lord commands me to flee wickedness and not look back.\nWhat lessons do you learn about fleeing wickedness as you read about Lot and his family? For example, what impresses you about what the angels said and did to help Lot and his family escape destruction? (see\nGenesis 19:12–17\n). How does the Lord help you and your family flee or find protection from evil influences in the world? Think about situations where you may be tempted to “[look] back” (verse 26) when you ought to be looking forward with faith in the Savior. What does\nLuke 9:62\nadd to your understanding of this concept?\nSee also\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 19:9–15\n(in the Bible appendix).\nGenesis 19:26\nWhat did Lot’s wife do wrong?\nElder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:\n“Apparently, what was wrong with Lot’s wife was that she wasn’t just\nlooking\nback; in her heart she wanted to\ngo\nback. It would appear that even before she was past the city limits, she was already missing what Sodom and Gomorrah had offered her. …\n“It is possible that Lot’s wife looked back with resentment toward the Lord for what He was asking her to leave behind. … So it isn’t just that she looked back; she looked back\nlongingly.\nIn short, her attachment to the past outweighed her confidence in the future. That, apparently, was at least part of her sin.\n“… I plead with you not to dwell on days now gone nor to yearn vainly for yesterdays, however good those yesterdays may have been. The past is to be learned from but not lived in. We look back to claim the embers from glowing experiences but not the ashes. And when we have learned what we need to learn and have brought with us the best that we have experienced, then we look ahead and remember that\nfaith is always pointed toward the future\n. …\n“… Dwelling on past lives, including past mistakes, is just not right! It is not the gospel of Jesus Christ. …\n“To all [people] of every generation, I call out, ‘Remember Lot’s wife’ [\nLuke 17:32\n]. Faith is for the future. Faith builds on the past but never longs to stay there. Faith trusts that God has great things in store for each of us and that Christ truly is the ‘high priest of good things to come’ (\nHebrews 9:11\n)” (“\nThe Best Is Yet to Be\n,”\nEnsign\n, Jan. 2010, 24, 26–27).\nAbraham and Isaac\n, by Harold Copping\nGenesis 22:1–19\nAbraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac is a similitude of God and His Son.\nAlthough we don’t know all the reasons God commanded Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice, we do know it was a test of his faith in God. We also know it was “a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son” (\nJacob 4:5\n). As you read\nGenesis 22:1–19\n, you could look for symbols or similarities between Abraham’s offering of Isaac and the Father’s offering of His Son, Jesus Christ. Consider writing what you find in a chart like this:\nAbraham and Isaac\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ\nAbraham and Isaac\nIsaac was the only begotten son of Abraham and Sarah (\nGenesis 22:2\n; see also\nHebrews 11:17\n)\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ\nJesus is the Only Begotten of the Father (\nJohn 3:16\n)\nAbraham and Isaac\nIsaac was to be offered in place of a lamb (\nGenesis 22:7–9\n)\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ\nJesus Christ is the Lamb of God (\nJohn 1:29\n)\nWhat symbols or similarities to the Savior’s atoning sacrifice do you find most meaningful? Consider singing or reading the lyrics of a hymn that shows Heavenly Father’s love for us, such as “\nGod Loved Us, So He Sent His Son\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 187. You might also record your feelings about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and Their sacrifice for you.\nIf you want to study more about the sacrifice of our Savior, consider reading President Jeffrey R. Holland’s message “\nBehold the Lamb of God\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 44–46). Why is a lamb such a powerful symbol of the Son of God? What did President Holland teach that increases your reverence for Heavenly Father’s gift?\nSee also “Akedah (The Binding)” (video), Gospel Library.\n12:57\nAkedah (The Binding)\nUse visuals to teach.\nTo add variety in teaching and learning, you might use one or more of the pictures in this outline as you study the stories in\nGenesis 18–23\n. For example, you and your family or class could note details in the pictures of Abraham and Isaac. Talk about why these details are important to the story, and find these details in the scriptures. How do they highlight the story’s symbolism of the sacrifice of the Son of God?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nDid Lot offer his daughters to the abuses of a mob?\nWhy did God destroy Sodom and Gomorrah?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 17:15–21\n;\n18:14\n;\n21:1–7\nI can trust God to keep His promises.\nTo learn about Abraham and Sarah’s trust in God’s promises, you and your children could talk about a time when they had to wait for something they really wanted. You could then look at the picture of Sarah and Isaac at the beginning of this outline and talk about the promise God made to her and Abraham (see also “\nAbraham and Sarah,\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 28–31). Help your children think of things that God has promised us if we are faithful. Encourage them to be patient and trust that God will keep His promises.\n2:20\nAbraham and Sarah\nTo help your children learn the important truth in\nGenesis 18:14\n, you could write each word from the first sentence of that verse on separate pieces of paper. Then mix the papers up, and invite your children to put the words in the correct order. You and your children could then read\nGenesis 17:15–21\n;\n21:1–7\nto find an example of something the Lord did that seemed impossible. Share with your children your faith that the Lord will fulfill His promises, even if they seem impossible or take a long time.\nGenesis 19:15–26\nI can flee wickedness.\nAsk your children about situations in which someone might invite them to do something they know isn’t right. How would we “flee” these situations? Summarize\nGenesis 19:15–26\nby explaining that Lot’s family lived in a very wicked city and angels warned them to leave. As you and your children read together\nverses 15–17, 26\n, ask them what it might mean for us today to “escape” evil and “look not behind” (\nverse 17\n).\nSodom\n, by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld\nGenesis 22:1–14\nAbraham obeyed the Lord.\nUsing pictures of Abraham and Isaac and of the Crucifixion (see\nGospel Art Book,\nnos. 9\n,\n57\n) can help your children compare the story in\nGenesis 22\nwith the Savior’s sacrifice (see\nMatthew 27:26–37\n). What can we learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from the accounts of Abraham and Isaac and of the Crucifixion? (See also “\nAbraham and Isaac\n,” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 34–37.)\n2:0\nAbraham and Isaac\nCan you think of a simple game to play with your children that requires them to follow directions? Maybe the directions could lead to a hidden picture of the Savior. The game could prompt a conversation about things Heavenly Father has commanded us to do so we can live with Him and Jesus Christ again. Consider singing a song such as “\nKeep the Commandments\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 146–47). This week’s activity page could help as well.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n\n\n--- SEMINARY_TEACHER: Seminary Teacher Week 9: Lesson 25: Lesson 25—Genesis 15–18; 21This lesson can help students increase their trust that the Lord will keep His promises.; Lesson 26: Lesson 26—Genesis 19This lesson can help students avoid evil influences in their lives so they can more fully follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.... ---\n\n--- Lesson 25 ---\nThe Lord has made glorious promises to the faithful, but sometimes the circumstances of our lives can lead us to wonder how these promises can possibly be fulfilled. Abraham and Sarah may have felt that way after the Lord promised in their old age that Sarah would have a child. This lesson can help students increase their trust that the Lord will keep His promises. Student preparation: Invite students to memorize and reflect on the first line found in Genesis 18:14 : “Is any thing too hard for the Lord?” You could encourage them to think of times they have seen the Lord accomplish seemingly impossible things in the scriptures, their own lives, or the lives of others. Possible Learning Activities The Lord’s promises to us Display the following scenarios to illustrate why a person might question whether God will keep His promises. For another scenario, you could watch “ Continue in Patience ” (2:41), from time code 1:07 to 1:55. This video is available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . You could also invite students to create their own, similar scenarios. 2:42 A young woman has chosen to be honest in her schoolwork, believing the Lord will bless her. She notices her grades are worse than other students who are cheating. A young man received his patriarchal blessing, which states that he will serve a full-time mission. During a medical exam, doctors discover he has physical complications that will not allow him to serve. A young woman has put Moroni’s promise to the test by reading the Book of Mormon and praying to know that it is true. She feels she has not received an answer. What are some questions these young people might have about God and His promises? Invite students to think of situations in which they or people they know could have a difficult time seeing how the Lord will fulfill promised blessings. Consider inviting students to write about these situations in their study journals. They might also write any questions they have. Encourage students to put forth effort that can invite the Holy Ghost into their learning. Testify that as they do so, the Holy Ghost can help them find answers to their questions and increase their trust that the Lord will fulfill His promises. The Lord’s promises to Abraham and Sarah As students study the account of Sarah and Abraham, you could help them practice reading the scriptures within the appropriate context. The following paragraph can introduce students to this skill: As we study the scriptures, it can be helpful to understand the context (circumstances or background surrounding a particular passage). The context can clarify and bring a deeper understanding to the stories or teachings in the scriptures. For example, while studying the story of Abraham and Sarah, it can be helpful to know that for much of his life, Abraham desired to be a father (see Abraham 1:2 ). But as he and his wife Sarah aged past normal childbearing years, it appeared that they would not experience the promised blessings of having children of their own during their mortal lives. The handout titled “The Lord’s Promises to Abraham and Sarah” can help students practice using context to better understand what they are reading in the scriptures. You could model this by studying Genesis 15:1–6 as a class. You could then place students in small groups to study the other verses. Before students study, you might explain that as part of His covenant with Abram and Sarai, the Lord changed their names to Abraham and Sarah (see Genesis 17:5, 15 ). You could also explain that the word laugh in Genesis 17:17 ; 18:12 ; and 21:6 comes from the Hebrew root tzachak , which can also mean “to rejoice” (see also Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 17:23 ). Open PDF After students have studied and discussed with their groups, consider inviting a few volunteers to share their insights with the class. You could then ask the following questions: How do you feel the context helped you understand what you studied? How might you have felt if you had experienced what Abraham and Sarah did in these verses? The Lord keeps His promises Read Genesis 21:1–6 , looking for how the Lord kept His promises to Abraham and Sarah. What truths do you learn about the Lord from this account? When students state converting principles in their own words, it can deepen their understanding of the scriptures and the words of the prophets. Sometimes students may struggle to identify truths from a scripture passage. Providing a prophetic statement like the following can help clarify what they are learning and help them be successful in stating truths. (For additional training on helping students state converting principles, see “ Focus on truths that lead to conversion and build faith in Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills.) President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, shared a lesson he learned about God’s promises: God’s promises are not always fulfilled as quickly as or in the way we might hope; they come according to His timing and in His ways. (“ Continue in Patience ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2010, 58) One truth students could identify is that the Lord fulfills His promises in His time and in His way . How can we benefit from times when the Lord’s promises are not immediately fulfilled in our lives? What do you know about the Lord that could help you while you wait for His promises to be fulfilled? Students might benefit by looking for scriptures about the Lord that could help them answer the previous question. Possible passages could include John 14:18 ; 1 Nephi 9:6 ; Mosiah 24:14 ; Doctrine and Covenants 24:8 ; 68:6 . Experiences and testimonies To help students reflect on what they have learned, consider displaying the following statement or watching “ Good Things to Come ” (4:55), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Invite students to think of personal experiences that could relate to the statement or video. 4:55 President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared the following insight about the Lord’s promised blessings: Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don’t come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come . (“ An High Priest of Good Things to Come ,” Ensign , Nov. 1999, 38) What experiences have you or others had that have helped you believe that the Lord will keep His promises in His way and in His time? Prepare students to testify of the truths they have learned or felt. You could do this by displaying the following instructions: Choose one of the following activities to complete in your study journal: Reflect on the scenarios that were shared at the beginning of the lesson. Write a letter to one of those individuals, and include why you believe the Lord will keep His promises. Write a short paragraph in your journal. Include things you have learned and felt today that could help you when you are waiting for the Lord’s promises to be fulfilled. Invite a few volunteers to share their feelings with the class. You could conclude by sharing your witness that the Lord will keep His promises.\n\n\n--- Lesson 26 ---\nThe Lord has always been concerned about evil influences in our lives. Members of Lot’s family were influenced by the evils that surrounded them in the city of Sodom. This lesson can help students avoid evil influences in their lives so they can more fully follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to think about influences in their lives or temptations they face that prevent them from following Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Invite them to think about why they need to remove these obstacles from their lives and how they might do so. Possible Learning Activities Small choices with big consequences Elder Massimo De Feo of the Seventy shared an important truth about the effect our choices can have: The decisions we make every day may seem small, but they always have real implications and big consequences, for good or bad. (“ Small Choices, Big Consequences ,” Ensign , Aug. 2019, 34) What are some examples of small choices we make that can have big consequences? If needed, consider sharing a few examples, such as the media we use; the type of friends we choose; or the choices we make about studying the scriptures, attending church, or praying. Other examples may be more relevant to your students. Invite the students to discuss how these choices could have big consequences, for good or bad. Then share the following to help students prepare themselves spiritually for today’s lesson. Think about choices you are currently making that are leading you toward Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Also think about choices that may be leading you away from Them. As you study today, pay attention to spiritual impressions about how you can come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Lot pitches his tent toward Sodom The Old Testament contains an account of a man named Lot, the nephew of Abraham. Lot and his family lived in the city of Sodom, which was known for its extreme wickedness (see Genesis 13:13 ; 18:20 ; Ezekiel 16:49–50 ; Jude 1:7–8 ). It was a seemingly small choice that led Lot and his family to dwell in Sodom. Invite students to share what they know about the circumstances that led Lot to dwell in Sodom. The following explanation could be used as needed. After Abraham, Lot, and their families moved from Egypt to the land of Canaan, there was a disagreement between Abraham’s herdsmen and Lot’s herdsmen over their grazing land. To help avoid further conflict, Abraham and Lot separated their families, and each decided where they would live (see Genesis 13:8–9 ). Rather than reading the following verses as a class, students could work with a partner. Partnerships could read the verses and draw a picture depicting the actions of Lot and Abraham. Read Genesis 13:10–13, 18 , looking for where each family decided to live. (In these verses, Abram refers to Abraham. The Lord later changed his name to Abraham, as recorded in Genesis 17:5 .) What differences did you notice between each family’s decision? What decisions could someone make today that might be similar to Lot pitching his tent toward Sodom? What counsel might you give in these situations? If students struggle to think of modern-day decisions that are similar to Lot pitching his tent toward Sodom, you could share a few examples, then allow students to give advice for these situations. Examples could include using unclean language, choosing media with inappropriate content, lowering standards of dress or modesty to fit in, or spending time with friends who disregard the Savior’s teachings. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah Lot and his family did not remain with their tent pitched toward Sodom. Eventually, they moved to and “dwelt in Sodom” ( Genesis 14:12 ; emphasis added). Students could cross-reference Genesis 14:12 with Genesis 13:12 in their scriptures. If students created a drawing earlier in the lesson, you could also invite them to update their drawing to reflect Lot’s new location. The inhabitants of Sodom and the nearby city of Gomorrah rejected the prophets the Lord sent to warn them (see Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 203). In His mercy, the Lord sent messengers to Sodom to warn Lot and his family to leave before the city was destroyed (see Genesis 19:12–13 ). Because the people rejected the prophets and persisted in wickedness they were destroyed. Read Genesis 19:14–19, 24–26 , looking for how Lot and his family responded to the instructions to leave the city quickly. What stands out to you in these verses? Why? What do these verses teach you about the Lord? You may also want to ask students what they are learning that could help someone who feels like it is not a big deal to participate in seemingly small acts of wickedness. To help students understand why Lot’s wife was turned into a “pillar of salt” (verse 26), it could be helpful to explain that Lot’s wife might not have merely looked back but might have returned to Sodom (see Luke 17:28–32 ). You could also share the following statement by President Jeffrey R. Holland. President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared possible reasons why Lot’s wife was turned into a “pillar of salt” (verse 26): Apparently what was wrong with Lot’s wife was that she wasn’t just looking back; in her heart she wanted to go back. … It is possible that Lot’s wife looked back with resentment toward the Lord for what He was asking her to leave behind. (“ Remember Lot’s Wife ” [Brigham Young University devotional, Jan. 13, 2009], 2, speeches.byu.edu ) Consider inviting students to discuss the following question with a partner or a small group before sharing their responses with the class. What are some truths you learn from the account of Lot and his family that could apply to situations you face in your life? Using their own words, students could identify truths like the following: Allowing evil influences into our lives—even seemingly small ones—can lead us away from Jesus Christ. As disciples of Jesus Christ, we should flee wickedness and not look back. To help students better understand and feel the importance of these truths, consider discussing questions like the following. What can help you recognize seemingly small influences that would lead you away from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? How can the Savior help us leave our past mistakes behind and move forward with faith? Invite the students to share experiences they have that relate to the truths you are discussing. You could also share your own experiences. Apply it to your life To help the students apply the truths they have studied, display the following instructions and questions. Invite students to seek inspiration from God to recognize changes He would have them make. Think about what actions you have felt prompted to take as a result of what you have studied today. In your study journal, write a plan for what you will do and when you will do it. If needed, the following questions could help you create a plan: What are some seemingly small decisions you are currently making that could eventually lead you away from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? What changes will you make? What will you do to leave past mistakes behind and move forward with faith in Jesus Christ? Consider testifying of the truths you have studied today. Encourage students to act on their plans.\n\n\n--- Lesson 27 ---\nOur mortal minds may never fully comprehend the heart-wrenching commandment God gave to Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac. The Nephite prophet Jacob increased our understanding of the powerful symbolism of this commandment when he taught that the sacrifice was “a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son” ( Jacob 4:5 ). This lesson can help students feel the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. Student preparation: Invite students to identify a scripture they have found that helps them recognize the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for us. Have them come prepared to share it. Possible Learning Activities The love of God Consider beginning the lesson by sharing the following statement. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then a member of the First Presidency, described the love Heavenly Father has for His children: 19:44 Think of the purest, most all-consuming love you can imagine. Now multiply that love by an infinite amount—that is the measure of God’s love for you. God does not look on the outward appearance. I believe that He doesn’t care one bit if we live in a castle or a cottage, if we are handsome or homely, if we are famous or forgotten. Though we are incomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, God’s love encompasses us completely. (“ The Love of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2009, 22) In addition to the words used by President Uchtdorf, what are some other words or phrases you could use to describe God’s love for us? To help the students personalize the lesson to their lives, invite them to consider how often they feel or recognize the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. You might also invite them to consider what questions they currently have about the love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Encourage the students as they study today to pay attention to impressions from the Holy Ghost that can help them feel the love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. A manifestation of God’s love The scriptures contain many teachings that describe the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for us. One example is in John 3:16 . Read John 3:16 , looking for the greatest manifestation of Heavenly Father’s love. How would you summarize what you found? Students may share something like Heavenly Father demonstrated His love for us through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ . How does the Savior’s atoning sacrifice demonstrate the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for us? Abraham is commanded to sacrifice his son Explain that today, students will study an account that can teach us about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ demonstrated through the Savior’s Atonement. Consider displaying the following picture. What do you know about this experience from the lives of Abraham and Isaac? After students share their responses, explain the following. The account of Abraham and Isaac can teach us about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ demonstrated toward us through the Savior’s atoning sacrifice. Read Jacob 4:5 , looking for what Jacob taught about this account. What did you find? As students study the account of Abraham and Isaac in Genesis 22 , invite them to pay attention to what this account can symbolically teach them about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. To prepare students to do this, consider making two columns on the board. Title one column Abraham and Isaac and the other column Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ . You could also invite the students to create this chart in their study journals. Students could complete the following study activity on their own or with a partner. Consider sharing one example from the completed chart (found later in the lesson) before students begin their study. Prayerfully read Genesis 22:1–14 , looking for similarities to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Highlight meaningful scripture phrases. Record your thoughts about what these phrases teach you about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The following chart contains examples of insights students may find while they study this account. As needed, you could use these examples to help students in their study. For example, you might share the insight about the land of Moriah (see Genesis 22:2 ) before or after students study. Abraham and Isaac Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ Genesis 22:2, 12 —“thine only son” Jesus Christ is Heavenly Father’s Only Begotten Son (see John 3:16 ). Genesis 22:2 —“the land of Moriah” “The site known traditionally as the place where Abraham offered Isaac is … in the same area in which the Father would make the sacrifice of His Son” ( Old Testament Student Manual , 3rd ed. [2003], 77). Genesis 22:2 —“a burnt offering” Burnt offerings were a form of animal sacrifice. Animal sacrifice was symbolic of Jesus Christ (see Moses 5:4–7 ). Genesis 22:6 —“took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son” Christ carried His cross (see John 19:16–18 ). Genesis 22:7–8 —“God will provide himself a lamb” Heavenly Father sent His Son, the Lamb of God, as an atoning sacrifice (see John 1:29 ). Genesis 22:9 —“bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar” Christ was bound to the cross with nails (see 1 Nephi 11:33 ). After students have had time to study, give them an opportunity to share what the Spirit taught them as they studied these verses. You might ask questions like the following as part of this discussion. What did you learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from the story of Abraham and Isaac? What were some of the symbols of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that were most meaningful to you? Why? God’s love for me Give students an opportunity to reflect on the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. To prepare them to reflect, you could sing or listen to a hymn that focuses on that love, such as “ God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son ” ( Hymns , no. 187). You could also consider sharing the statement by President Dallin H. Oaks in Additional Resources. How can remembering the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for you affect your life? What has helped or could help you to feel the love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Conclude the lesson by inviting students to think about what they have learned and felt today about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. Invite them to record their thoughts and spiritual impressions in their study journals. Consider sharing your testimony about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for each of us. Encourage the students to seek out experiences that will help them consistently feel God’s love for them.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 18 ---\n1. And theLordappearedunto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;\n2. And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, threemenstood by him: and when he sawthem,he ran to meet them from the tent door, andbowedhimself toward the ground,\n3. And said, MyLord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:\n4. Let little water, I pray you, be fetched, andwashyour feet, andrestyourselves under the tree:\n5. And I will fetch morsel of bread, andcomfortye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are yecometo your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.\n6. And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, kneadit,and make cakes upon the hearth.\n7. And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht calf tender and good, and gaveitunto young man; and he hasted to dress it.\n8. And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and setitbefore them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.\n9. And they said unto him, WhereisSarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.\n10. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo,Sarahthy wife shall have ason. And Sarah hearditin the tent door, whichwasbehind him.\n11. Now Abraham and Sarahwereoldandwell stricken in age;anditceasedto be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n12. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord beingoldalso?\n13. And theLordsaid unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarahlaugh, saying, Shall I of surety bear child, which amold?\n14. Is any thing toohardfor theLord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to thetimeof life, and Sarah shall have son.\n15. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\n16. And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n17. And theLordsaid, Shall Ihidefrom Abraham that thing which I do;\n18. Seeing that Abraham shall surely become great and mightynation, and all thenationsof the earth shall beblessedin him?\n19. For Iknowhim, that he willcommandhischildrenand hishouseholdafter him, and they shallkeepthe way of theLord, to do justice andjudgment; that theLordmay bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.\n20. And theLordsaid, Because thecryof Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because theirsinis very grievous;\n21. I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I willknow.\n22. Andthe men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abrahamstoodyet before theLord.\n23. And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou alsodestroytherighteouswith thewicked?\n24. Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and notsparethe place for the fifty righteous thataretherein?\n25. That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not theJudgeof all the earth do right?\n26. And theLordsaid, If I find in Sodom fiftyrighteouswithin the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\n27. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, whicham butdustand ashes:\n28. Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city forlack offive? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroyit.\n29. And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not doitfor fortys sake.\n30. And he saidunto him,Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not doit,if I find thirty there.\n31. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroyitfor twentys sake.\n32. And he said, Oh let not the Lord beangry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall befound there. And he said, I willnotdestroyitfor tens sake.\n33. And theLordwenthis way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 19 ---\n1. And there cametwoangelsto Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeingthemrose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;\n2. And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servants house, and tarry all night, andwashyour feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.\n3. And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them afeast, and did bakeunleavenedbread, and they did eat.\n4. But before they lay down, the men of the city,eventhe men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:\n5. And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Wherearethe men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we mayknowthem.\n6. And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,\n7. And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.\n8. Beholdnow, I have twodaughterswhich have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them asisgood in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for thereforecamethey under the shadow of my roof.\n9. And they said, Stand back. And they saidagain,This onefellowcame in tosojourn, and he will needs be judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,evenLot, and came near to break the door.\n10. But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.\n11. And they smote the men thatwereat the door of the house withblindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\n12. Andthe mensaid unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city,bringthemout of this place:\n13. For we will destroy this place, because thecryof them is waxen great before the face of theLord; and theLordhath sent us to destroy it.\n14. And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up,getyououtof this place; for theLordwill destroy this city. But he seemed as one thatmockedunto his sons in law.\n15. And when the morning arose, then theangelshastenedLot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\n16. And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; theLordbeingmercifulunto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.\n17. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life;looknot behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to themountain, lest thou be consumed.\n18. And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:\n19. Behold now, thy servant hath foundgracein thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:\n20. Behold now, this cityisnear to flee unto, and itisa little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (isit not little one?) and my soul shall live.\n21. And he said unto him, See, I haveacceptedthee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.\n22. Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was calledZoar.\n23. The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n24. Then theLordrained uponSodomand uponGomorrahbrimstone and firefrom theLordout of heaven;\n25. And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.\n26. But his wifelookedback from behind him, and she became apillarof salt.\n27. And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before theLord:\n28. And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, thesmokeof the country went up as the smoke of furnace.\n29. And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.\n30. And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in themountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in cave, he and his two daughters.\n31. And thefirstborn saidunto the younger, Our fatherisold, andthere isnot man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:\n32. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n33. And they made their father drink wine that night: and thefirstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n34. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,andlie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n35. Andthey made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n36. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.\n37. And the firstborn bare son, and called his nameMoab: the sameisthe father of theMoabitesunto this day.\n38. And the younger, she also bare son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the sameisthe father of the children ofAmmonunto this day.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 20 ---\n1. And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh andShur, and sojourned inGerar.\n2. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, Sheismy sister: andAbimelechking of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n3. ButGodcame to Abimelech in dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thouart buta dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for sheisa mans wife.\n4. But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay alsoa righteous nation?\n5. Said he not unto me, Sheismysister? and she, even she herself said, Heismybrother: in theintegrityof my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.\n6. And God said unto him in dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.\n7. Now therefore restore the manhiswife; for heisa prophet, and he shallprayfor thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restorehernot, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all thatarethine.\n8. Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.\n9. ThenAbimelechcalled Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thoudoneunto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom great sin? thou hastdonedeeds unto me that ought not to be done.\n10. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?\n11. And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely thefearof Godisnot in this place; and they will slay me for my wifes sake.\n12. And yet indeedshe ismysister; sheisthe daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\n13. And it came to pass, when God caused me towanderfrom my fathers house, that I said unto her, Thisisthykindnesswhich thoushalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, Heismy brother.\n14. And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gavethemunto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.\n15. And Abimelech said, Behold, mylandisbefore thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.\n16. And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thybrothera thousandpiecesof silver: behold, heisto thee covering of the eyes, unto all thatarewith thee, and with allother:thus she was reproved.\n17. So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they barechildren.\n18. For theLordhad fastclosedup all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abrahams wife.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 21 ---\n1. And theLordvisitedSarah as he had said, and theLorddid untoSarahas he had spoken.\n2. For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham asonin hisoldage, at the settimeof which God had spoken to him.\n3. And Abraham called the name of hissonthat was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.\n4. And Abrahamcircumcisedhis son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.\n5. And Abraham was anhundredyears old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.\n6. And Sarah said, God hath made me tolaugh,so thatall that hear will laugh with me.\n7. And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have bornhima son in hisoldage.\n8. And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made great feast thesameday that Isaac was weaned.\n9. And Sarah saw the son ofHagarthe Egyptian, which she hadbornunto Abraham,mocking.\n10. Wherefore she said unto Abraham,Castout this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not beheirwith my son,evenwith Isaac.\n11. And the thing was very grievous in Abrahams sight because of hisson.\n12. And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for inIsaacshall thyseedbe called.\n13. And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make anation, because heisthy seed.\n14. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and bottle of water, and gaveituntoHagar, puttingiton her shoulder, and the child, andsenther away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness ofBeer-sheba.\n15. And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.\n16. And she went, and sat her down over againsthima good way off, as it were bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over againsthim,and lift up her voice, and wept.\n17. And God heard the voice of the lad; and theangelof God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where heis.\n18. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him greatnation.\n19. And Godopenedher eyes, and she saw well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.\n20. And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became anarcher.\n21. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him awifeout of the land ofEgypt.\n22. And it came to pass at that time, thatAbimelechandPhicholthe chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying,Godiswith thee in all that thou doest:\n23. Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my sons son:butaccording to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.\n24. And Abraham said, I will swear.\n25. And AbrahamreprovedAbimelech because of well of water, which Abimelechs servantshadviolently taken away.\n26. And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard Iof it,but to day.\n27. And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of themmadea covenant.\n28. And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n29. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, Whatmeanthese seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?\n30. And he said, Fortheseseven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be witness unto me, that I have digged thiswell.\n31. Wherefore he called that placeBeer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.\n32. Thus they made covenant at Beer-sheba:thenAbimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.\n33. AndAbrahamplanted agrovein Beer-sheba, andcalledthere on the name of theLord, theeverlastingGod.\n34. And Abraham sojourned in thePhilistinesland many days.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 22 ---\n1. And it came to pass after thesethings, that God didtemptAbraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold,hereIam.\n2. And he said,Takenow thy son, thineonlysonIsaac, whom thoulovest, and get thee into the land ofMoriah; and offer him there for burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\n3. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave thewoodfor the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.\n4. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.\n5. And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder andworship, and come again to you.\n6. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, andlaiditupon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and knife; and they went both of them together.\n7. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said,HereamI, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but whereisthe lamb for burnt offering?\n8. And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself alambfor burnt offering: so they went both of them together.\n9. And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, andlaidthe wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on thealtarupon the wood.\n10. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.\n11. And the angel of theLordcalled unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, HereamI.\n12. And he said,Laynot thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thoufearestGod, seeing thou hast notwithheldthy son, thine onlysonfrom me.\n13. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behindhima ram caught in thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for burnt offering in the stead of his son.\n14. And Abraham called the name of that placeJehovah-jireh: as it is saidtothis day,Inthe mount of theLordit shall be seen.\n15. And the angel of theLordcalled unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,\n16. And said, By myself have Isworn, saith theLord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine onlyson:\n17. That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thyseedas the stars of the heaven, and as thesandwhichisupon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess thegateof his enemies;\n18. And in thyseedshall all the nations of the earth beblessed;because thou hastobeyedmy voice.\n19. So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.\n20. And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold,Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;\n21. Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,\n22. And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n23. AndBethuelbegatRebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abrahamsbrother.\n24. And his concubine, whose namewasReumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Genesis 23 ---\n1. And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old:these werethe years of the life of Sarah.\n2. And Sarahdiedin Kirjath-arba; the sameisHebronin the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\n3. And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,\n4. Iama strangerand sojourner with you: give me possession of buryingplace with you, that I may bury mydeadout of my sight.\n5. And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,\n6. Hear us, my lord: thouarta mighty princeamong us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.\n7. And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,evento the children of Heth.\n8. And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,\n9. That he may give me the cave ofMachpelah, which he hath, whichisin the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for possession of buryingplace amongst you.\n10. And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth,evenof all that went in at thegateof his city, saying,\n11. Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave thatistherein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.\n12. And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.\n13. And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thouwilt give it,I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; takeitof me, and I will bury my dead there.\n14. And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,\n15. My lord, hearken unto me: the landis worthfour hundredshekelsof silver; whatisthat betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.\n16. And Abraham hearkened untoEphron; and AbrahamweighedtoEphronthe silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, currentmoneywith the merchant.\n17. And the field ofEphron, whichwasin Machpelah, whichwasbefore Mamre, the field, and the cave whichwastherein, and all the trees thatwerein the field, thatwerein all the borders round about, were made sure\n18. Unto Abraham for possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.\n19. And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the sameisHebronin the land of Canaan.\n20. And the field, and the cave thatistherein, were made sure unto Abraham for possession of buryingplace by the sons of Heth.",

      "content": "Abraham and Sarah’s life, filled with events both heartbreaking and heartwarming, is evidence of a truth Abraham learned in a vision—that we are on earth to be proven, “to see if [we] will do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command” (\nAbraham 3:25\n). Would Abraham and Sarah prove faithful? Would they continue to have faith in God’s promise of a large posterity, even when they were still childless in their old age? And once Isaac was born, would their faith endure the unthinkable—a command to sacrifice the very son through whom God had promised to fulfill that covenant?\nAbraham and Sarah trusted God, and He trusted them (see\nGenesis 15:6\n;\nRomans 4:3\n). In\nGenesis 18–23\n, we find stories from the lives of Abraham, Sarah, and others that can prompt us to think about our own willingness to believe God’s promises, to flee wickedness and never look back, and to trust God regardless of the sacrifice. In proving us, God also improves us.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 18:9–14\n;\n21:1–7\nThe Lord fulfills His promises in His own time.\nThe Lord has made glorious promises to the faithful, but sometimes the circumstances of our lives can cause us to wonder how these promises can possibly be fulfilled. Abraham and Sarah may have felt that way. What do you learn from their experiences? It may be helpful to begin your study by reviewing what the Lord had promised in\nGenesis 17:4, 15–22\n. How did Abraham and Sarah react? (see\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 17:23\n[in\nGenesis 17:17\n, footnote\nb\n];\nGenesis 18:9–12\n). How did the Lord respond to help them have greater faith in His promises? (see\nGenesis 18:14\n).\nWhat do you find in these verses that builds your faith? What other experiences—in your life or someone else’s—have strengthened your faith that the Lord will fulfill His promises in His own time and way? You might also ponder how you can sustain your faith when promised blessings are\nnot\nreceived in this life. What counsel do you find in\nHebrews 11:8–13\nand President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nChrist Is Risen; Faith in Him Will Move Mountains\n”? (\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 101–4).\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 88:68\n.\nGenesis 19:12–29\nThe Lord commands me to flee wickedness and not look back.\nWhat lessons do you learn about fleeing wickedness as you read about Lot and his family? For example, what impresses you about what the angels said and did to help Lot and his family escape destruction? (see\nGenesis 19:12–17\n). How does the Lord help you and your family flee or find protection from evil influences in the world? Think about situations where you may be tempted to “[look] back” (verse 26) when you ought to be looking forward with faith in the Savior. What does\nLuke 9:62\nadd to your understanding of this concept?\nSee also\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 19:9–15\n(in the Bible appendix).\nGenesis 19:26\nWhat did Lot’s wife do wrong?\nElder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:\n“Apparently, what was wrong with Lot’s wife was that she wasn’t just\nlooking\nback; in her heart she wanted to\ngo\nback. It would appear that even before she was past the city limits, she was already missing what Sodom and Gomorrah had offered her. …\n“It is possible that Lot’s wife looked back with resentment toward the Lord for what He was asking her to leave behind. … So it isn’t just that she looked back; she looked back\nlongingly.\nIn short, her attachment to the past outweighed her confidence in the future. That, apparently, was at least part of her sin.\n“… I plead with you not to dwell on days now gone nor to yearn vainly for yesterdays, however good those yesterdays may have been. The past is to be learned from but not lived in. We look back to claim the embers from glowing experiences but not the ashes. And when we have learned what we need to learn and have brought with us the best that we have experienced, then we look ahead and remember that\nfaith is always pointed toward the future\n. …\n“… Dwelling on past lives, including past mistakes, is just not right! It is not the gospel of Jesus Christ. …\n“To all [people] of every generation, I call out, ‘Remember Lot’s wife’ [\nLuke 17:32\n]. Faith is for the future. Faith builds on the past but never longs to stay there. Faith trusts that God has great things in store for each of us and that Christ truly is the ‘high priest of good things to come’ (\nHebrews 9:11\n)” (“\nThe Best Is Yet to Be\n,”\nEnsign\n, Jan. 2010, 24, 26–27).\nAbraham and Isaac\n, by Harold Copping\nGenesis 22:1–19\nAbraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac is a similitude of God and His Son.\nAlthough we don’t know all the reasons God commanded Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice, we do know it was a test of his faith in God. We also know it was “a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son” (\nJacob 4:5\n). As you read\nGenesis 22:1–19\n, you could look for symbols or similarities between Abraham’s offering of Isaac and the Father’s offering of His Son, Jesus Christ. Consider writing what you find in a chart like this:\nAbraham and Isaac\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ\nAbraham and Isaac\nIsaac was the only begotten son of Abraham and Sarah (\nGenesis 22:2\n; see also\nHebrews 11:17\n)\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ\nJesus is the Only Begotten of the Father (\nJohn 3:16\n)\nAbraham and Isaac\nIsaac was to be offered in place of a lamb (\nGenesis 22:7–9\n)\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ\nJesus Christ is the Lamb of God (\nJohn 1:29\n)\nWhat symbols or similarities to the Savior’s atoning sacrifice do you find most meaningful? Consider singing or reading the lyrics of a hymn that shows Heavenly Father’s love for us, such as “\nGod Loved Us, So He Sent His Son\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 187. You might also record your feelings about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and Their sacrifice for you.\nIf you want to study more about the sacrifice of our Savior, consider reading President Jeffrey R. Holland’s message “\nBehold the Lamb of God\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 44–46). Why is a lamb such a powerful symbol of the Son of God?

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 25 ---\nThe Lord has made glorious promises to the faithful, but sometimes the circumstances of our lives can lead us to wonder how these promises can possibly be fulfilled. Abraham and Sarah may have felt that way after the Lord promised in their old age that Sarah would have a child. This lesson can help students increase their trust that the Lord will keep His promises. Student preparation: Invite students to memorize and reflect on the first line found in Genesis 18:14 : “Is any thing too hard for the Lord?” You could encourage them to think of times they have seen the Lord accomplish seemingly impossible things in the scriptures, their own lives, or the lives of others. Possible Learning Activities The Lord’s promises to us Display the following scenarios to illustrate why a person might question whether God will keep His promises. For another scenario, you could watch “ Continue in Patience ” (2:41), from time code 1:07 to 1:55. This video is available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . You could also invite students to create their own, similar scenarios. 2:42 A young woman has chosen to be honest in her schoolwork, believing the Lord will bless her. She notices her grades are worse than other students who are cheating. A young man received his patriarchal blessing, which states that he will serve a full-time mission. During a medical exam, doctors discover he has physical complications that will not allow him to serve. A young woman has put Moroni’s promise to the test by reading the Book of Mormon and praying to know that it is true. She feels she has not received an answer. What are some questions these young people might have about God and His promises? Invite students to think of situations in which they or people they know could have a difficult time seeing how the Lord will fulfill promised blessings. Consider inviting students to write about these situations in their study journals. They might also write any questions they have. Encourage students to put forth effort that can invite the Holy Ghost into their learning. Testify that as they do so, the Holy Ghost can help them find answers to their questions and increase their trust that the Lord will fulfill His promises. The Lord’s promises to Abraham and Sarah As students study the account of Sarah and Abraham, you could help them practice reading the scriptures within the appropriate context. The following paragraph can introduce students to this skill: As we study the scriptures, it can be helpful to understand the context (circumstances or background surrounding a particular passage). The context can clarify and bring a deeper understanding to the stories or teachings in the scriptures. For example, while studying the story of Abraham and Sarah, it can be helpful to know that for much of his life, Abraham desired to be a father (see Abraham 1:2 ). But as he and his wife Sarah aged past normal childbearing years, it appeared that they would not experience the promised blessings of having children of their own during their mortal lives. The handout titled “The Lord’s Promises to Abraham and Sarah” can help students practice using context to better understand what they are reading in the scriptures. You could model this by studying Genesis 15:1–6 as a class. You could then place students in small groups to study the other verses. Before students study, you might explain that as part of His covenant with Abram and Sarai, the Lord changed their names to Abraham and Sarah (see Genesis 17:5, 15 ). You could also explain that the word laugh in Genesis 17:17 ; 18:12 ; and 21:6 comes from the Hebrew root tzachak , which can also mean “to rejoice” (see also Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 17:23 ). Open PDF After students have studied and discussed with their groups, consider inviting a few volunteers to share their insights with the class. You could then ask the following questions: How do you feel the context helped you understand what you studied? How might you have felt if you had experienced what Abraham and Sarah did in these verses? The Lord keeps His promises Read Genesis 21:1–6 , looking for how the Lord kept His promises to Abraham and Sarah. What truths do you learn about the Lord from this account? When students state converting principles in their own words, it can deepen their understanding of the scriptures and the words of the prophets. Sometimes students may struggle to identify truths from a scripture passage. Providing a prophetic statement like the following can help clarify what they are learning and help them be successful in stating truths. (For additional training on helping students state converting principles, see “ Focus on truths that lead to conversion and build faith in Jesus Christ ” in Teacher Development Skills.) President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then of the First Presidency, shared a lesson he learned about God’s promises: God’s promises are not always fulfilled as quickly as or in the way we might hope; they come according to His timing and in His ways. (“ Continue in Patience ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2010, 58) One truth students could identify is that the Lord fulfills His promises in His time and in His way . How can we benefit from times when the Lord’s promises are not immediately fulfilled in our lives? What do you know about the Lord that could help you while you wait for His promises to be fulfilled? Students might benefit by looking for scriptures about the Lord that could help them answer the previous question. Possible passages could include John 14:18 ; 1 Nephi 9:6 ; Mosiah 24:14 ; Doctrine and Covenants 24:8 ; 68:6 . Experiences and testimonies To help students reflect on what they have learned, consider displaying the following statement or watching “ Good Things to Come ” (4:55), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Invite students to think of personal experiences that could relate to the statement or video. 4:55 President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared the following insight about the Lord’s promised blessings: Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don’t come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come . (“ An High Priest of Good Things to Come ,” Ensign , Nov. 1999, 38) What experiences have you or others had that have helped you believe that the Lord will keep His promises in His way and in His time? Prepare students to testify of the truths they have learned or felt. You could do this by displaying the following instructions: Choose one of the following activities to complete in your study journal: Reflect on the scenarios that were shared at the beginning of the lesson. Write a letter to one of those individuals, and include why you believe the Lord will keep His promises. Write a short paragraph in your journal. Include things you have learned and felt today that could help you when you are waiting for the Lord’s promises to be fulfilled. Invite a few volunteers to share their feelings with the class. You could conclude by sharing your witness that the Lord will keep His promises.\n\n\n--- Lesson 26 ---\nThe Lord has always been concerned about evil influences in our lives. Members of Lot’s family were influenced by the evils that surrounded them in the city of Sodom. This lesson can help students avoid evil influences in their lives so they can more fully follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Student preparation: Invite students to think about influences in their lives or temptations they face that prevent them from following Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Invite them to think about why they need to remove these obstacles from their lives and how they might do so. Possible Learning Activities Small choices with big consequences Elder Massimo De Feo of the Seventy shared an important truth about the effect our choices can have: The decisions we make every day may seem small, but they always have real implications and big consequences, for good or bad. (“ Small Choices, Big Consequences ,” Ensign , Aug. 2019, 34) What are some examples of small choices we make that can have big consequences? If needed, consider sharing a few examples, such as the media we use; the type of friends we choose; or the choices we make about studying the scriptures, attending church, or praying. Other examples may be more relevant to your students. Invite the students to discuss how these choices could have big consequences, for good or bad. Then share the following to help students prepare themselves spiritually for today’s lesson. Think about choices you are currently making that are leading you toward Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Also think about choices that may be leading you away from Them. As you study today, pay attention to spiritual impressions about how you can come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Lot pitches his tent toward Sodom The Old Testament contains an account of a man named Lot, the nephew of Abraham. Lot and his family lived in the city of Sodom, which was known for its extreme wickedness (see Genesis 13:13 ; 18:20 ; Ezekiel 16:49–50 ; Jude 1:7–8 ). It was a seemingly small choice that led Lot and his family to dwell in Sodom. Invite students to share what they know about the circumstances that led Lot to dwell in Sodom. The following explanation could be used as needed. After Abraham, Lot, and their families moved from Egypt to the land of Canaan, there was a disagreement between Abraham’s herdsmen and Lot’s herdsmen over their grazing land. To help avoid further conflict, Abraham and Lot separated their families, and each decided where they would live (see Genesis 13:8–9 ). Rather than reading the following verses as a class, students could work with a partner. Partnerships could read the verses and draw a picture depicting the actions of Lot and Abraham. Read Genesis 13:10–13, 18 , looking for where each family decided to live. (In these verses, Abram refers to Abraham. The Lord later changed his name to Abraham, as recorded in Genesis 17:5 .) What differences did you notice between each family’s decision? What decisions could someone make today that might be similar to Lot pitching his tent toward Sodom? What counsel might you give in these situations? If students struggle to think of modern-day decisions that are similar to Lot pitching his tent toward Sodom, you could share a few examples, then allow students to give advice for these situations. Examples could include using unclean language, choosing media with inappropriate content, lowering standards of dress or modesty to fit in, or spending time with friends who disregard the Savior’s teachings. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah Lot and his family did not remain with their tent pitched toward Sodom. Eventually, they moved to and “dwelt in Sodom” ( Genesis 14:12 ; emphasis added). Students could cross-reference Genesis 14:12 with Genesis 13:12 in their scriptures. If students created a drawing earlier in the lesson, you could also invite them to update their drawing to reflect Lot’s new location. The inhabitants of Sodom and the nearby city of Gomorrah rejected the prophets the Lord sent to warn them (see Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 203). In His mercy, the Lord sent messengers to Sodom to warn Lot and his family to leave before the city was destroyed (see Genesis 19:12–13 ). Because the people rejected the prophets and persisted in wickedness they were destroyed. Read Genesis 19:14–19, 24–26 , looking for how Lot and his family responded to the instructions to leave the city quickly. What stands out to you in these verses? Why? What do these verses teach you about the Lord? You may also want to ask students what they are learning that could help someone who feels like it is not a big deal to participate in seemingly small acts of wickedness. To help students understand why Lot’s wife was turned into a “pillar of salt” (verse 26), it could be helpful to explain that Lot’s wife might not have merely looked back but might have returned to Sodom (see Luke 17:28–32 ). You could also share the following statement by President Jeffrey R. Holland. President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared possible reasons why Lot’s wife was turned into a “pillar of salt” (verse 26): Apparently what was wrong with Lot’s wife was that she wasn’t just looking back; in her heart she wanted to go back. … It is possible that Lot’s wife looked back with resentment toward the Lord for what He was asking her to leave behind. (“ Remember Lot’s Wife ” [Brigham Young University devotional, Jan. 13, 2009], 2, speeches.byu.edu ) Consider inviting students to discuss the following question with a partner or a small group before sharing their responses with the class. What are some truths you learn from the account of Lot and his family that could apply to situations you face in your life? Using their own words, students could identify truths like the following: Allowing evil influences into our lives—even seemingly small ones—can lead us away from Jesus Christ. As disciples of Jesus Christ, we should flee wickedness and not look back. To help students better understand and feel the importance of these truths, consider discussing questions like the following. What can help you recognize seemingly small influences that would lead you away from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? How can the Savior help us leave our past mistakes behind and move forward with faith? Invite the students to share experiences they have that relate to the truths you are discussing. You could also share your own experiences. Apply it to your life To help the students apply the truths they have studied, display the following instructions and questions. Invite students to seek inspiration from God to recognize changes He would have them make. Think about what actions you have felt prompted to take as a result of what you have studied today. In your study journal, write a plan for what you will do and when you will do it. If needed, the following questions could help you create a plan: What are some seemingly small decisions you are currently making that could eventually lead you away from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? What changes will you make? What will you do to leave past mistakes behind and move forward with faith in Jesus Christ? Consider testifying of the truths you have studied today. Encourage students to act on their plans.\n\n\n--- Lesson 27 ---\nOur mortal minds may never fully comprehend the heart-wrenching commandment God gave to Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac. The Nephite prophet Jacob increased our understanding of the powerful symbolism of this commandment when he taught that the sacrifice was “a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son” ( Jacob 4:5 ). This lesson can help students feel the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. Student preparation: Invite students to identify a scripture they have found that helps them recognize the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for us. Have them come prepared to share it. Possible Learning Activities The love of God Consider beginning the lesson by sharing the following statement. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, then a member of the First Presidency, described the love Heavenly Father has for His children: 19:44 Think of the purest, most all-consuming love you can imagine. Now multiply that love by an infinite amount—that is the measure of God’s love for you. God does not look on the outward appearance. I believe that He doesn’t care one bit if we live in a castle or a cottage, if we are handsome or homely, if we are famous or forgotten. Though we are incomplete, God loves us completely. Though we are imperfect, He loves us perfectly. Though we may feel lost and without compass, God’s love encompasses us completely. (“ The Love of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2009, 22) In addition to the words used by President Uchtdorf, what are some other words or phrases you could use to describe God’s love for us? To help the students personalize the lesson to their lives, invite them to consider how often they feel or recognize the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. You might also invite them to consider what questions they currently have about the love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Encourage the students as they study today to pay attention to impressions from the Holy Ghost that can help them feel the love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. A manifestation of God’s love The scriptures contain many teachings that describe the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for us. One example is in John 3:16 . Read John 3:16 , looking for the greatest manifestation of Heavenly Father’s love. How would you summarize what you found? Students may share something like Heavenly Father demonstrated His love for us through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ . How does the Savior’s atoning sacrifice demonstrate the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for us? Abraham is commanded to sacrifice his son Explain that today, students will study an account that can teach us about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ demonstrated through the Savior’s Atonement. Consider displaying the following picture. What do you know about this experience from the lives of Abraham and Isaac? After students share their responses, explain the following. The account of Abraham and Isaac can teach us about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ demonstrated toward us through the Savior’s atoning sacrifice. Read Jacob 4:5 , looking for what Jacob taught about this account. What did you find? As students study the account of Abraham and Isaac in Genesis 22 , invite them to pay attention to what this account can symbolically teach them about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. To prepare students to do this, consider making two columns on the board. Title one column Abraham and Isaac and the other column Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ . You could also invite the students to create this chart in their study journals. Students could complete the following study activity on their own or with a partner. Consider sharing one example from the completed chart (found later in the lesson) before students begin their study. Prayerfully read Genesis 22:1–14 , looking for similarities to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Highlight meaningful scripture phrases. Record your thoughts about what these phrases teach you about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The following chart contains examples of insights students may find while they study this account. As needed, you could use these examples to help students in their study. For example, you might share the insight about the land of Moriah (see Genesis 22:2 ) before or after students study. Abraham and Isaac Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ Genesis 22:2, 12 —“thine only son” Jesus Christ is Heavenly Father’s Only Begotten Son (see John 3:16 ). Genesis 22:2 —“the land of Moriah” “The site known traditionally as the place where Abraham offered Isaac is … in the same area in which the Father would make the sacrifice of His Son” ( Old Testament Student Manual , 3rd ed. [2003], 77). Genesis 22:2 —“a burnt offering” Burnt offerings were a form of animal sacrifice. Animal sacrifice was symbolic of Jesus Christ (see Moses 5:4–7 ). Genesis 22:6 —“took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son” Christ carried His cross (see John 19:16–18 ). Genesis 22:7–8 —“God will provide himself a lamb” Heavenly Father sent His Son, the Lamb of God, as an atoning sacrifice (see John 1:29 ). Genesis 22:9 —“bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar” Christ was bound to the cross with nails (see 1 Nephi 11:33 ). After students have had time to study, give them an opportunity to share what the Spirit taught them as they studied these verses. You might ask questions like the following as part of this discussion. What did you learn about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ from the story of Abraham and Isaac? What were some of the symbols of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ that were most meaningful to you? Why? God’s love for me Give students an opportunity to reflect on the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. To prepare them to reflect, you could sing or listen to a hymn that focuses on that love, such as “ God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son ” ( Hymns , no. 187). You could also consider sharing the statement by President Dallin H. Oaks in Additional Resources. How can remembering the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for you affect your life? What has helped or could help you to feel the love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Conclude the lesson by inviting students to think about what they have learned and felt today about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for them. Invite them to record their thoughts and spiritual impressions in their study journals. Consider sharing your testimony about the love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have for each of us. Encourage the students to seek out experiences that will help them consistently feel God’s love for them.",

And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, threemenstood by him: and when he sawthem,he ran to meet them from the tent door, andbowedhimself toward the ground,\n3.

And I will fetch morsel of bread, andcomfortye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are yecometo your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.\n6. And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, kneadit,and make cakes upon the hearth.\n7. And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht calf tender and good, and gaveitunto young man; and he hasted to dress it.\n8. And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and setitbefore them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.\n9. And they said unto him, WhereisSarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.\n10. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo,Sarahthy wife shall have ason. And Sarah hearditin the tent door, whichwasbehind him.\n11. Now Abraham and Sarahwereoldandwell stricken in age;anditceasedto be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n12. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord beingoldalso?\n13. And theLordsaid unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarahlaugh, saying, Shall I of surety bear child, which amold?\n14. Is any thing toohardfor theLord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to thetimeof life, and Sarah shall have son.\n15. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.

Andthe men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abrahamstoodyet before theLord.\n23. And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou alsodestroytherighteouswith thewicked?\n24. Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and notsparethe place for the fifty righteous thataretherein?\n25.

And he said unto him, See, I haveacceptedthee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.\n22. Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was calledZoar.\n23. The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n24. Then theLordrained uponSodomand uponGomorrahbrimstone and firefrom theLordout of heaven;\n25. And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.\n26. But his wifelookedback from behind him, and she became apillarof salt.\n27. And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before theLord:\n28. And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, thesmokeof the country went up as the smoke of furnace.\n29. And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.\n30. And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in themountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in cave, he and his two daughters.\n31. And thefirstborn saidunto the younger, Our fatherisold, andthere isnot man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:\n32. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n33. And they made their father drink wine that night: and thefirstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n34. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,andlie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n35. Andthey made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n36. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.\n37. And the firstborn bare son, and called his nameMoab: the sameisthe father of theMoabitesunto this day.\n38. And the younger, she also bare son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the sameisthe father of the children ofAmmonunto this day.",

Now therefore restore the manhiswife; for heisa prophet, and he shallprayfor thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restorehernot, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all thatarethine.\n8. Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.\n9.

And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?\n11.

And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have bornhima son in hisoldage.\n8. And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made great feast thesameday that Isaac was weaned.\n9. And Sarah saw the son ofHagarthe Egyptian, which she hadbornunto Abraham,mocking.\n10. Wherefore she said unto Abraham,Castout this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not beheirwith my son,evenwith Isaac.\n11.

And she went, and sat her down over againsthima good way off, as it were bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over againsthim,and lift up her voice, and wept.\n17. And God heard the voice of the lad; and theangelof God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where heis.\n18. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him greatnation.\n19.
