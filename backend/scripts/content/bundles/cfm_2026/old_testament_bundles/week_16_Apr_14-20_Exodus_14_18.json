Their escape from Egypt, it seemed, would be short lived. But God had a message for the Israelites that He wanted them to remember for generations: “Fear ye not. … The Lord shall fight for you” (\nExodus 14:13–14\n).\nSince that time, when God’s people have needed faith and courage, they have told this story. When Nephi wanted to inspire his brothers, he said, “Let us be strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground” (\n1 Nephi 4:2\n). When King Limhi wanted his captive people to “lift up [their] heads, and rejoice,” he reminded them of this same story (\nMosiah 7:19\n). So did Alma, when he wanted to testify to his son of God’s power (see\nAlma 36:28\n). And when we feel trapped—when we need a little more faith to “see the salvation of the Lord”—we can remember how “the Lord saved Israel that day” (\nExodus 14:13, 30\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nExodus 14\n;\nExodus 15:1–21\nThe Lord can do a “great work” in my life.\nAs you read\nExodus 14:1–10\n, imagine how the Israelites might have felt as they saw Pharaoh’s army closing in. Perhaps you feel that you need a miracle to survive a difficult challenge you are facing. What do you find in\nExodus 14:13–31\nthat inspires you to seek God’s power in your life? Ponder how you have seen His power in the past. What have you learned about Him from these experiences?\nExodus 15:1–19\nis a song of praise that the Israelites sang after the Lord parted the Red Sea. Which phrases in this song do you find especially meaningful? Maybe there’s a hymn that you feel like singing when the Lord has done something amazing for you, such as “\nRedeemer of Israel\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 6). Consider singing or listening to it as part of your worship today.\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 8:2–3\n.\nExodus 15:22–27\n;\n16:1–15\n;\n17:1–7\nThe Lord can make bitter things sweet.\nReading about Israel’s journey might lead you to think about things in your life that have seemed “bitter” like the waters of Marah (see\nExodus 15:23–27\n). How has the Lord made bitter things in your life sweet? What value have these experiences had in your life?\nYou’ll notice more examples of bitter experiences for the Israelites in\nExodus 16\nand\n17\n. It’s tempting to be critical of their murmuring or complaining, but as you read, consider whether you have ever done the same thing. What do you learn from the Israelites’ experiences that can help you murmur less and trust God more? What do these verses teach you about God?\nSee also\n1 Nephi 2:11–12\n.\nThe Israelites gathering manna. Neo-gothic fresco, Trnava (detail)\nExodus 16\nThe Lord offers me daily spiritual nourishment.\nSince we all need to eat, the Lord often compares spiritual things to food. Look for His spiritual lessons in the Israelites’ experiences with manna in\nExodus 16\n. For example, what do you find in the Lord’s instructions in\nExodus 16:16, 19, 22–26\nthat applies to your spiritual nourishment?\nTo discover other lessons the Lord may want you to learn from this miracle, ponder questions like these:\nWhat does the Lord give me that is like the daily manna that He gave the Israelites?\nWhat can I do that is like gathering manna?\nYou may find additional insights in one or more of these videos: “Daily Bread: Pattern,” “Daily Bread: Experience,” and “Daily Bread: Change” (Gospel Library).\n2:52\nDaily Bread: Pattern\n3:12\nDaily Bread: Experience\n3:0\nDaily Bread: Change\nThink of other things, besides eating, that you do every day. Why do certain things have to be done daily to be effective? What do you feel inspired to do to seek daily spiritual experiences?\nSee also Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “\nDaily Restoration\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 77–79; “Daily Restoration” (video), Gospel Library.\n5:27\nDaily Restoration\nExodus 17:1–7\nJesus Christ is my spiritual rock and living water.\nThink about the Savior as you read\nExodus 17:1–7\n. How is Jesus Christ like a rock to you? (see\nPsalm 62:6–7\n;\nHelaman 5:12\n). How is He like water? (see\nJohn 4:10–14\n;\n1 Corinthians 10:1–4\n;\n1 Nephi 11:25\n).\nLook for physical objects that testify of Christ.\nWhenever the scriptures describe things that could be symbols of Jesus Christ, like\nExodus 17:1–7\ndoes, it might be an opportunity for an object lesson. Looking at or touching a rock or water can make it easier to understand how these objects are like Jesus Christ. If you can involve multiple senses in learning, it will be more memorable and impactful.\nExodus 17:8–16\n;\n18:13–26\nDisciples help each other “bear the burden” of doing the Lord’s work.\nThere may be times in your life when you can relate to Moses—when others are depending on you, but your “hands [feel] heavy” (\nExodus 17:12\n). Other times, you might be more like Aaron, Hur, and Jethro, who supported Moses. Put yourself in the position of each of these people as you read\nExodus 17:8–16\n;\n18:13–26\n, and see what the Lord teaches you about His work.\nSee also\nMosiah 4:27\n;\n18:8–9\n.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nStudy Helps\nWhat was the purpose of the pillar of cloud and fire?\nWhat was symbolic about Israel’s crossing of the Red Sea?\nWhy did the Lord command Moses to destroy the Amalekites?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nExodus 14:5–22\nThe Lord can do a “great work” in my life.\nWhen the Lord parted the Red Sea, Moses and the Israelites saw how powerful He is. Let your children help you think of a fun way to reenact the story from\nExodus 14:5–22\n(see also “\nThe Passover\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 70–74). Maybe you could set up chairs or blankets and “divide” them like the Red Sea. Then you could share with each other how you have seen God’s power in your lives.\n2:54\nThe Passover\nWhat does\nDoctrine and Covenants 8:2–3\nadd to our understanding of the story in\nExodus 14\n? Consider telling your children about an experience when the Holy Ghost told you something in your mind or heart, and invite them to talk about their experiences. You could also sing a song about the Holy Ghost, such as “\nLet the Holy Spirit Guide\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 143).\nExodus 15:22–25\nThe Lord can make bitter things sweet.\nMaybe you and your children could drink something sweet and something bitter while studying\nExodus 15:22–25\ntogether. How has the Savior made “bitter” experiences in our lives “sweet”?\nExodus 15:23–25\n;\n16:14–15\n;\n17:1–6\nJesus is my Living Water, my Bread of Life, and my Rock.\nAs you and your children read\nExodus 15:23–25\n;\n16:14–15\n;\n17:1–6\n, let them help you find objects to help tell each story—like a branch (to heal the water at Marah), a jar or pot (to fill with manna), and a rock (for the water at Horeb). What do these stories remind us about what Jesus Christ does for us? As part of your discussion, you might read\nMatthew 7:24–27\n;\nJohn 4:10–14\n;\n6:29–35, 48–51\n;\nHelaman 5:12\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n.\nOne Before God\n, by Joseph Brickey (detail)\nExodus 17:8–16\n;\n18:13–26\nI can help “bear the burden” of doing the Lord’s work.\nAs you read\nExodus 17:8–16\n, you could invite a child to hold their hands high in the air. When the child gets tired, other children could help, the way Aaron and Hur helped Moses. What does this story teach about how we can help God’s kingdom be successful? You could also read\nExodus 18:13–26\nand talk about the heavy responsibilities of people who serve in your ward. What can we do today to help our Church leaders, just as Aaron and Hur helped the prophet Moses?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n\n\n\n--- SEMINARY_TEACHER: Seminary Teacher Week 16: Lesson 45: Lesson 45—Exodus 14This lesson can help students feel the desire to place their trust in the Lord for strength and deliverance.; Lesson 46: Lesson 46—Exodus 15; 17This lesson can help students practice identifying truths from God in scripture accounts and connecting these truths to their lives.... ---\n\n--- Lesson 45 ---\nWe might feel hopeless at times, similar to how the Israelites might have felt while trapped between the Red Sea and Pharaoh’s army. However, Moses’s counsel to them still applies to us today: “Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord” ( Exodus 14:13 ). This lesson can help students feel the desire to place their trust in the Lord for strength and deliverance. Student preparation: Invite students to study Exodus 14:13–14 and to consider aspects of their lives where these verses could help. Possible Learning Activities Surrounded by trials Help students reflect on challenges in their lives that can make them feel overwhelmed or trapped. One way to do this is to share the following statement from Brother Milton Camargo of the Sunday School General Presidency. You could write his father’s advice in the center of the board. Brother Milton Camargo, First Counselor in the Sunday School General Presidency, shared advice from his father: My father used to tell me, “Don’t focus so intensely on your problems that you can’t see the solution.” (“ Focus on Jesus Christ ,” Liahona , May 2023, 64) Ask students to share what they think Brother Camargo’s father was teaching. Then invite them to write around the statement on the board any problems, challenges, or trials that may be difficult for them to see solutions to. Students could answer the first of the following questions aloud. With the second question, it may be wise to invite them to quietly ponder their answers. Ponder times when you may have felt there was no solution to the problems you have faced. What are some ways a person might respond in such circumstances? How do you normally respond under such circumstances? As you study Exodus 14 today, seek inspiration from the Holy Ghost to help you increase your desire to trust in the Lord as you face or prepare to face challenges and trials. The Israelites’ predicament To help students understand the Israelites’ situation in Exodus 14 , display or help them locate map 2 in the Bible Maps, found in the Latter-day Saint edition of the King James Bible. As you share the following paragraph, invite students to locate Pi-hahiroth (#3) on the map. As the children of Israel left Egypt, the Lord commanded Moses to lead them to Pi-hahiroth ( Exodus 14:2 ). Shortly after letting the Israelites go, Pharaoh realized that “the wilderness had shut them in” ( Exodus 14:3 ), so he hardened his heart and pursued after them. President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained the following about the Israelites’ circumstances. The children of Israel [were in a] horrible predicament. … There were chariots behind them, sand dunes on every side, and a lot of water immediately ahead. … In this case it was literally a matter of life and death. (“ Cast Not Away Therefore Your Confidence ,” Ensign , Mar. 2000, 9) To help students visualize this account, you could show them the following image of the Red Sea. Invite them to imagine they were among the Israelites at this moment. How might you have responded under these circumstances? Consider inviting students to compare and contrast the Israelites’ response to their circumstances with Moses’s response. Noting similarities and differences between people, teachings, and events in the scriptures is an important scripture study skill. Making these comparisons can help students identify important gospel truths that they might not see otherwise. You might want to briefly explain the skill of comparing and contrasting. Invite students to practice it in the following study activity. In your study journal, create a small chart with two columns. Label one column Israelites and the other Moses . Read Exodus 14:10–14 , looking for what the Israelites said and what Moses said. Summarize what you find in the appropriate column. What did the Israelites focus on in these circumstances? What did Moses focus on? What do you notice by comparing what they said? What do you learn from this account that could help you with your challenges? Among other truths students may share, help them see the following: Focusing on Jesus Christ can increase our hope during challenges and trials. What problems do you think can happen if we only focus on our challenges and trials? Focusing on Christ Consider sharing the rest of Brother Camargo’s statement from the beginning of the lesson. Brother Camargo shared the following about the power of focusing on Jesus Christ: My father used to tell me, “Don’t focus so intensely on your problems that you can’t see the solution.” I testify that the Lord Jesus Christ is the solution to even our most difficult problems. (“ Focus on Jesus Christ ,” Liahona , May 2023, 64) Why do you think focusing on Jesus Christ is helpful when we feel surrounded or trapped by our challenges or trials? To demonstrate what Brother Camargo taught, invite students to first focus their mind on the challenges they wrote on the board. Have them focus on those challenges for 30 seconds. Then ask them to ponder how they feel. Next, place a picture of Jesus Christ at the front of the class. Invite students to solely focus their thoughts on His power and love for 30 seconds. Invite students to write their answers to the following question in their study journals. What difference might you notice when you focus on Jesus Christ and His power more than the challenges you are facing? Display the questions below, and separate students into pairs or small groups. Invite them to choose two or three of the challenges on the board and to discuss these questions. In what ways can Jesus Christ be a solution to the problems, challenges, or trials you chose? How can a person act with faith in Jesus Christ during that specific problem, challenge, or trial? Invite willing students to share what they learned or felt. The Lord’s mighty power Consider having students read the following verses individually or in partnerships. Students could also draw what they read in their study journals. If it is beneficial for your students, you could invite several students to briefly act out verses 19–22. For example, you could create a small barrier that can be removed or separated, allowing the students to walk through. Another option is to show the animated video “ The Passover ” from time code 1:28 to 2:32. This video is found on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 2:54 Read Exodus 14:15–31 , looking for how the Lord fought for and delivered the Israelites. What inspires you about this account? What did you find that helps you want to place your trust in the Lord? Personal strength and deliverance The next question may initially be difficult for students to answer. Hearing the experiences of others can help them think of their own. You might want to share an experience you or someone you know has had that could help answer the question. Or show a video such as the following that depicts the importance of focusing on the Savior during our trials: “ Finding Christ During Difficult Times ” (4:35) “ Feeling the Lord’s Love and Goodness in Trials ” (4:18) Both videos are available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 4:35 4:17 How has focusing on Jesus Christ during a challenge or trial helped you or someone you know? Help students see that sometimes we may not be delivered from our challenges in the ways we expect. However, focusing on Jesus Christ can help us find hope and strength no matter what we are facing. Consider ending by sharing your testimony of Jesus Christ and of the importance of focusing on Him in our trials. You may consider including the statement below with your testimony. Brother Camargo testified that the Savior can help us: The Lord Jesus Christ lives today. He can be an active, daily presence in our lives. He is the solution to our problems, but we must lift our eyes and raise our sights to see Him. He has said, “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not” [ Doctrine and Covenants 6:36 ]. (“ Focus on Jesus Christ ,” Liahona , May 2023, 67)\n\n\n--- Lesson 46 ---\nGod often uses physical experiences to teach essential spiritual lessons. For example, God used the Israelites’ needs for water and for help in battle to teach them and us. Through practice and the guidance of the Spirit, we can learn to identify and apply the spiritual truths in scripture accounts to our lives. This lesson can help students practice identifying truths from God in scripture accounts and connecting those truths to their lives. Student preparation: Invite students to reflect on the accounts they have studied from the Old Testament and the Pearl of Great Price so far this semester. Ask them to come to class prepared to share how they would complete the following sentence: “I like the account of because it teaches me that .” Possible Learning Activities Identifying gospel truths in the scriptures In this lesson, students will have the chance to find and share various gospel truths. It may be helpful to remind students that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are the source of all gospel truths. Explain that learning how to find and apply gospel truths can help us draw nearer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. To begin the lesson, consider asking students how they would fill in the blanks in the sentence below. If a visual reminder of some of the accounts you’ve studied would be helpful, you might display images like the ones below. Or invite students to look through images of the Old Testament in the Gospel Art Book [2009], which can be found in Gospel Library under “Videos and Images.” Complete the following sentence with a scripture account of your choice: “I like the account of because it teaches me that .” As volunteers share with the class, they could write the truths they identify on the board. The truths they share may be stated as doctrine, such as “We are children of God” (see Moses 1:1–7 ). Or they may be stated as principles that can be applied, such as “If we are willing to be led by God, He will increase our ability to accomplish His work” (see Moses 6:31–36 ). You might also ask students who share to explain why the truth they wrote is important in their lives. As the teacher, try not to give your own response to every student’s comment. It can be helpful to ask the class to share what they learned from another student’s comment. This can help students discover their own thoughts and feelings through the influence of the Holy Ghost. For additional training on this, see “ Help learners take responsibility for their learning ” in Teacher Development Skills [2022]. As students share, you might point out that there is an important difference between liking a scripture account and finding relevant truths from God in that account. Explain that as they prayerfully seek the Spirit’s guidance in their scripture study, Heavenly Father will help them find the truths that are the most relevant to them. After students are done sharing, invite them to reflect on their efforts to identify truths in their personal scripture study. You might use the following prompts. Record your answers to the following questions in your study journal. Is your personal scripture study helping you grow closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Why or why not? How often do you pause during your scripture study to identify truths that you feel Heavenly Father wants you to focus on? Do you seek to understand how scripture accounts apply to your life? As you study accounts from Exodus 15 and 17 today, pay attention to inspired thoughts and feelings from the Spirit. Look for impressions that could help you get more out of your personal scripture study. Identifying gospel truths from Exodus 15, 17 In this section of the lesson, students will have the chance to identify and find relevant truths from the account of the Lord caring for the Israelites in the wilderness. Consider dividing the class into partnerships. Assign similar numbers of partnerships to study each of the accounts in the handout. You might assign students with less experience studying the scriptures to work with students who have more experience. Be sure to give partnerships enough time to discuss and prepare. You could walk around and help students who might need a little extra direction. Open PDF After sufficient time to study, discuss, and prepare, give partnerships the opportunity to share what they learned. The following are ways students might share depending on available time: Each pair shares with a pair that studied a different account. They then rotate one more time to share with a partnership who studied the remaining account. Partnerships first get together and share with others who studied the same account. (This could give students additional insights about their own account.) Then students get together and share in groups of six, with each partnership having studied different accounts. Partnerships take turns presenting what they prepared to the entire class. Personalizing the lesson To conclude the lesson, consider using prompts like the following to help students personalize what they learned. Record your thoughts about the following in your study journal: What do you feel Heavenly Father would like you to remember from this lesson? Why? How could you use the skill of identifying truths from scripture accounts in your personal scripture study? How might using this skill affect your experience with the scriptures? You might invite volunteers to share part of what they wrote in their study journals. Also, consider looking for opportunities in upcoming lessons to invite students to share truths they are learning from their personal scripture study.\n\n\n--- Lesson 47 ---\nAfter the Lord delivered His people from Egypt, they encountered new challenges and opportunities for growth. The Israelites could no longer rely on the Egyptians to provide necessities like food and water. They needed to learn to rely on the Lord for their daily needs. This lesson can help students rely on the Lord daily. Student preparation: Invite students to look for evidence of the Lord’s power in their lives between now and the next class. Encourage them to take time in their personal or family prayers to thank Heavenly Father for His help. Possible Learning Activities The need for daily nourishment Consider beginning class by discussing things our bodies need every day. For example, you could display some bread. Invite a student who is hungry to come to the front of the class and eat some of the bread. As the student eats, ask him or her the following questions: When did you last eat? If you recently ate, why are you hungry now? Why do we have to eat regularly? Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles compared feeding our physical bodies to caring for our spirits: We all recognize the need for physical sustenance. Hunger and thirst remind us very strongly if we forget. But the spiritual need for sustenance is equally strong. (“ Daily Bread: Pattern ,” Gospel Library) Why do you think the need to feed our spirits is as important as caring for our bodies? Why can it be easy to overlook our spiritual needs? Take some time to ponder the following questions. Consider recording your thoughts in your study journal: Do you feel the same desire to care for your spirit every day as you do for your body? Why or why not? What do you feel Heavenly Father would have you do each day to care for your spirit? Seek inspiration to know what you can continue to do, or what you can change, to provide your spirit with the daily strength from the Lord that it needs. Relying on the Lord daily After crossing the Red Sea, the Israelites “believed the Lord, and his servant Moses” ( Exodus 14:31 ). They sang and danced to praise the Lord for delivering them (see Exodus 15:1–21 ). However, the Israelites’ praise of the Lord did not last long. While Moses led them toward Mount Sinai, they faced various problems, and their faith was tested. Read Exodus 16:2–4, 11–15 , looking for how the Lord provided for the Israelites’ needs. What did you find? Consider inviting students to mark the word “manna” in Exodus 16:15 and to cross-reference or link it to John 6:47–51 . Read John 6:31–35, 47–51 , looking for what Jesus taught about manna. In what ways is manna similar to Jesus Christ? How is what Jesus offers us infinitely better than manna? Encourage students to focus on Jesus Christ as they study about manna. One way to do this is to provide students with the handout titled “Bread from Heaven.” Students could complete the handout individually or in small groups. Alternatively, you could invite small groups of students to read Exodus 16:14–31, 35 and to create a quiz about manna. They could write 3–4 questions that could be answered by reading the verses. Groups could then exchange quizzes with another group. Open PDF Share the correct answers after students have finished: 1. True; 2. False; 3. False; 4. True; 5. True; 6. False; 7. True; 8. False. How might these details about manna apply to our need for spiritual nourishment? What can these details about manna teach you about receiving the spiritual nourishment from Jesus Christ? Students may have discovered many valuable truths. They could share why they feel the truths they identified are important. You could also ask other follow-up questions. The rest of this lesson will focus on the following truth: when we rely on the Lord daily, He will bless us with the spiritual nourishment we need . ( Note: Students will reflect on their desire to rely on the Lord in Lesson 55: “ Assess Your Learning 3 .” If you feel impressed to focus on a different truth for the remainder of this lesson, be sure to make corresponding adaptations when you teach Lesson 55.) To deepen students’ understanding of our daily need for Jesus Christ, you could share the following statement or watch “ Daily Bread: Pattern ” (2:51), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 2:52 Elder Christofferson spoke of our need for daily spiritual nourishment from the Lord: We ought not to think that we can go weeks and months without spiritual sustenance and not suffer and not have a deadening influence in our spiritual life. Acknowledging the reality of our need for a daily spiritual administration, or manna, helps us increase in our courage to do the right thing and to serve others more than we would have if we ignored God. (“ Daily Bread: Pattern ,” Gospel Library) Why is relying on the Lord each day better than occasional, powerful spiritual experiences? Daily bread Provide the following instructions. In addition to the suggested scripture passages, students could look for statements from Church leaders by searching words or phrases such as “daily” or “each day” in the Gospel Library. In your study journal, label a page “Daily Bread: Jesus Christ.” In the middle of the page, draw a loaf of bread. Study the following scriptures, looking for things we can do every day to rely on the Lord and receive spiritual nourishment. Write what you find around your drawing of bread. Deuteronomy 8:3 1 Nephi 17:3 2 Nephi 32:3 Alma 37:36–37 Invite students to discuss what they discovered by asking questions such as the following. You could encourage students to add ideas to their study journals as they learn from their classmates. Which of these actions have helped you invite the Bread of Life, Jesus Christ, into your life daily? How has He nourished or strengthened you as a result? In addition to what you found in the scriptures, what other things do you try to do each day to rely on the Lord? What would you say to someone who feels they don’t need to do these things? If time allows, consider singing a hymn with the class about our need for the Lord, such as “ I Need Thee Every Hour ” ( Hymns , no. 98). Students could share lines from the hymn that are meaningful to them. Look at the list that you wrote around the bread in your study journal. Circle one or two ideas you feel the Lord would have you start doing or do differently to better rely on Him each day. Then answer the following: When and where will you do this thing each day? What challenges will you need to overcome to make this habit a part of your daily routine? How will you overcome these challenges? How do you think doing this thing every day might affect your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ over time? Conclude by sharing your thoughts and feelings about our need to rely on the Lord each day. Look for opportunities in future lessons to follow up on students’ efforts. You could also periodically update your students on your daily efforts to rely on the Lord.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Exodus 14 ---\n1. And theLordspake unto Moses, saying,\n2. Speak unto the children of Israel, that theyturnand encamp before Pi-hahiroth, betweenMigdoland the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.\n3. For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, Theyareentangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.\n4. AndI will harden Pharaohs heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoureduponPharaoh, and upon all hishost; that the Egyptians mayknowthat IamtheLord. And they did so.\n5. And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?\n6. And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:\n7. And he took six hundred chosenchariots, andall the chariotsof Egypt, and captains over every one of them.\n8. AndtheLordhardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went outwithanhighhand.\n9. But the Egyptianspursuedafter them, all the horsesandchariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, besidePi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.\n10. And when Pharaoh drew nigh,the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto theLord.\n11. And they said unto Moses, Becausethere wereno graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away todiein the wilderness? wherefore hast thoudealtthus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?\n12. Isnot this thewordthat we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? Forit had beenbetter for us toservethe Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.\n13. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of theLord, which he willshew to youto day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.\n14. TheLordshallfightfor you, and ye shall hold yourpeace.\n15. And theLordsaid unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:\n16. But lift thou up thyrod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, anddivideit: and the children of Israel shall go ondrygroundthrough the midst of the sea.\n17. AndI, behold, I willhardenthe hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: andIwill get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.\n18. And the Egyptians shall know that IamtheLord, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.\n19. And theangelof God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and thepillarof the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:\n20. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel;andit was cloud anddarknessto them,but it gave light by nightto these:so that the one came not near the other all the night.\n21. And Moses stretched out his hand over thesea; and theLordcausedtheseatogobackby strong east wind all that night, and made the seadryland,and thewatersweredivided.\n22. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dryground:and the waterswerea wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.\n23. And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea,evenall Pharaohs horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.\n24. And it came to pass, that in the morning watch theLordlooked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,\n25. Andtookoff their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said,Let us flee from the face of Israel; for theLordfighteth for them against the Egyptians.\n26. And theLordsaid unto Moses, Stretch out thinehandover the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.\n27. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned tohis strengthwhen the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fledagainst it; and theLordoverthrew theEgyptiansin the midst of the sea.\n28. And thewatersreturned, andcoveredthe chariots, and the horsemen,andall the host of Pharaoh that came into theseaafter them; there remained not so much asoneof them.\n29. But the children of Israel walked upondrylandin the midst of the sea; and the waterswerea wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.\n30. Thus theLordsavedIsrael that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.\n31. And Israel saw that great work which theLorddid upon the Egyptians: and the people feared theLord, andbelievedtheLord, and his servant Moses.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Exodus 15 ---\n1. ThensangMoses and the children of Israel this song unto theLord, and spake, saying, I willsingunto theLord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.\n2. TheLordismystrengthand song, and he is become mysalvation: heismy God, and I willprepare him an habitation; my fathers God, and I willexalthim.\n3. TheLordisa man ofwar: theLordishisname.\n4. Pharaohschariotsand his host hath hecastinto the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in theRed sea.\n5. The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as astone.\n6. Thyrighthand, OLord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, OLord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\n7. And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath,whichconsumed them asstubble.\n8. And with the blast of thy nostrils thewaterswere gathered together, the floods stood upright as anheap,andthe depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.\n9. The enemy said, I willpursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; mylustshall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.\n10. Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.\n11. Whoislikeunto thee, OLord, among the gods? whoislike thee, glorious inholiness,fearfulinpraises, doing wonders?\n12. Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.\n13. Thou in thy mercy hastledforth the peoplewhichthou hast redeemed: thou hast guidedthemin thy strength unto thy holy habitation.\n14. The people shallhear,andbe afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants ofPalestina.\n15. Then thedukesofEdomshall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shallmeltaway.\n16. Fearanddreadshall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall beasstill as stone; till thy people pass over, OLord, till the people pass over,whichthou hastpurchased.\n17. Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance,inthe place, OLord,whichthou hast made for thee to dwell in,intheSanctuary, O Lord,whichthy hands have established.\n18. TheLordshall reign for ever and ever.\n19. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and theLordbrought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on drylandin the midst of the sea.\n20. AndMiriamtheprophetess, thesisterof Aaron, took atimbrelin her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.\n21. And Miriam answered them,Singye to theLord, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.\n22. So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness ofShur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.\n23. And when they came toMarah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for theywerebitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.\n24. And the peoplemurmuredagainst Moses, saying, What shall we drink?\n25. And he cried unto theLord; and theLordshewed him tree,whichwhen he had cast into the waters, thewaterswere made sweet: there he made for them statute and an ordinance, and there heprovedthem,\n26. And said, If thou wiltdiligentlyhearkento the voice of theLordthy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, andkeepall his statutes, I will put none of thesediseasesupon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for IamtheLordthathealeththee.\n27. And they came to Elim, whereweretwelve wells of water, andthreescore and tenpalm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Exodus 16 ---\n1. And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, whichisbetween Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.\n2. And the whole congregation of the children of Israelmurmuredagainst Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:\n3. And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of theLordin the land of Egypt, when we sat by theflesh pots,andwhen we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly withhunger.\n4. Then said theLordunto Moses, Behold, I will rainbreadfrom heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather certainrateevery day, that I mayprovethem, whether they willwalkin my law, or no.\n5. And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall preparethatwhich they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.\n6. And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that theLordhath brought you out from the land of Egypt:\n7. And in the morning, then ye shall see thegloryof theLord; for that he heareth your murmurings against theLord: and whatarewe, that ye murmur against us?\n8. And Moses said,This shall be,when theLordshall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that theLordheareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and whatarewe? yourmurmuringsarenot against us, butagainsttheLord.\n9. And Mosesspakeunto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before theLord: for he hath heard your murmurings.\n10. And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, thegloryof theLordappeared in thecloud.\n11. And theLordspake unto Moses, saying,\n12. I have heard themurmuringsof the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that IamtheLordyour God.\n13. And it came to pass, that at even thequailscame up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about thehost.\n14. And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wildernessthere laya smallroundthing,assmall as the hoar frost on the ground.\n15. And when the children of Israel sawit,they said one to another,Itismanna: for they wist not what itwas.And Moses said unto them, Thisisthebreadwhich theLordhath given you to eat.\n16. Thisisthe thing which theLordhath commanded, Gather of it every manaccordingtohis eating, anomerfor every man,according tothe number of your persons; take ye every man forthemwhicharein his tents.\n17. And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.\n18. And when they did meteitwith an omer, he thatgatheredmuch had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.\n19. And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.\n20. Notwithstanding theyhearkenednot unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.\n21. And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sunwaxedhot, it melted.\n22. And it came to pass,thaton the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for oneman:and all the rulers of thecongregationcame and told Moses.\n23. And he said unto them, Thisis thatwhich theLordhath said, To morrowisthe rest of the holysabbathunto theLord:bakethatwhich ye will baketo day,andseethethat ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.\n24. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.\n25. And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to dayisa sabbath unto theLord: to day ye shall not find it in the field.\n26. Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day,which isthe sabbath, in it there shall be none.\n27. And it came to pass,thatthere went outsomeof the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.\n28. And theLordsaid unto Moses, How long refuse ye tokeepmy commandments and my laws?\n29. See, for that theLordhath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.\n30. So the people rested on the seventh day.\n31. And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and itwaslikecorianderseed, white; and the taste of itwaslike wafersmadewith honey.\n32. And Moses said, Thisisthe thing which theLordcommandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for yourgenerations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.\n33. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take apot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before theLord, to be kept for your generations.\n34. As theLordcommanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before theTestimony, to be kept.\n35. And the children of Israel did eatmannaforty years, until they came to land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.\n36. Now anomeristhe tenthpartof an ephah.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Exodus 17 ---\n1. And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness ofSin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of theLord, andpitchedin Rephidim: andthere wasno water for the people to drink.\n2. Wherefore the peopledid chide withMoses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do yetempt theLord?\n3. And the people thirsted there for water; and the peoplemurmuredagainst Moses, and said, Whereforeisthisthatthou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?\n4. And Moses cried unto theLord, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.\n5. And theLordsaid unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thyrod,wherewiththou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.\n6. Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shaltsmitetherock, and there shall comewaterout of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.\n7. And he called the name of the placeMassah, andMeribah, because of thechidingof the children of Israel, and because they tempted theLord, saying, Is theLordamong us, or not?\n8. Then cameAmalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.\n9. And Moses said untoJoshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with therodof God in mine hand.\n10. So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.\n11. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.\n12. But Moses handswereheavy; and they took stone, and putitunder him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hurstayed uphis hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.\n13. And JoshuadiscomfitedAmalek and his people with the edge of the sword.\n14. And theLordsaid unto Moses, Write thisfora memorial in abook, and rehearseitin the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance ofAmalekfrom under heaven.\n15. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of itJehovah-nissi:\n16. For he said,BecausetheLordhath swornthattheLordwill havewar with Amalek from generation to generation.\n\n--- SCRIPTURE: Exodus 18 ---\n1. WhenJethro, thepriestofMidian, Moses father in law, heard of all thatGodhad done for Moses, and for Israel his people,andthat theLordhad brought Israel out of Egypt;\n2. Then Jethro, Moses father in law, tookZipporah, Moses wife, after he had sent her back,\n3. And her twosons; of which the name of the onewasGershom; for he said,Ihave been an alien in strange land:\n4. And the name of the otherwasEliezer; for the God of my father,said he, wasmine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:\n5. And Jethro, Moses father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at themount of God:\n6. And hesaidunto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.\n7. And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other oftheirwelfare; and they came into the tent.\n8. And Moses told his father in law all that theLordhad done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israels sake,andall the travail that had come upon them by the way, andhowtheLorddelivered them.\n9. And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which theLordhad done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.\n10. And Jethro said, BlessedbetheLord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.\n11. Now I know that theLordisgreater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealtproudlyhe wasabove them.\n12. And Jethro, Moses father in law, took burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eatbreadwith Moses father in law before God.\n13. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat tojudgethe people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.\n14. And when Moses father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, Whatisthis thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?\n15. And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me toinquireof God:\n16. When they have amatter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do makethemknow the statutes of God, and his laws.\n17. And Moses father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doestisnot good.\n18. Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people thatiswith thee: for this thingistooheavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.\n19. Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee:Bethou for the people toGod-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:\n20. And thou shaltteachthemordinancesandlaws, and shalt shew them thewaywherein they mustwalk, and the work that they must do.\n21. Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the peopleablemen, such asfearGod,men of truth, hatingcovetousness; and placesuchover them,to berulersof thousands,andrulers ofhundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:\n22. And let themjudgethe people at all seasons: and it shall be,thatevery great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall beartheburdenwith thee.\n23. If thou shalt do this thing, and God command theeso,then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.\n24. So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.\n25. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made themheadsover the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.\n26. And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\n27. And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.",

      "content": "The Israelites were trapped. The Red Sea was on one side, and the army of Pharaoh was advancing on the other. Their escape from Egypt, it seemed, would be short lived. But God had a message for the Israelites that He wanted them to remember for generations: “Fear ye not. … The Lord shall fight for you” (\nExodus 14:13–14\n).\nSince that time, when God’s people have needed faith and courage, they have told this story. When Nephi wanted to inspire his brothers, he said, “Let us be strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground” (\n1 Nephi 4:2\n). When King Limhi wanted his captive people to “lift up [their] heads, and rejoice,” he reminded them of this same story (\nMosiah 7:19\n). So did Alma, when he wanted to testify to his son of God’s power (see\nAlma 36:28\n). And when we feel trapped—when we need a little more faith to “see the salvation of the Lord”—we can remember how “the Lord saved Israel that day” (\nExodus 14:13, 30\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nExodus 14\n;\nExodus 15:1–21\nThe Lord can do a “great work” in my life.\nAs you read\nExodus 14:1–10\n, imagine how the Israelites might have felt as they saw Pharaoh’s army closing in. Perhaps you feel that you need a miracle to survive a difficult challenge you are facing. What do you find in\nExodus 14:13–31\nthat inspires you to seek God’s power in your life? Ponder how you have seen His power in the past. What have you learned about Him from these experiences?\nExodus 15:1–19\nis a song of praise that the Israelites sang after the Lord parted the Red Sea. Which phrases in this song do you find especially meaningful? Maybe there’s a hymn that you feel like singing when the Lord has done something amazing for you, such as “\nRedeemer of Israel\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 6). Consider singing or listening to it as part of your worship today.\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 8:2–3\n.\nExodus 15:22–27\n;\n16:1–15\n;\n17:1–7\nThe Lord can make bitter things sweet.\nReading about Israel’s journey might lead you to think about things in your life that have seemed “bitter” like the waters of Marah (see\nExodus 15:23–27\n). How has the Lord made bitter things in your life sweet? What value have these experiences had in your life?\nYou’ll notice more examples of bitter experiences for the Israelites in\nExodus 16\nand\n17\n. It’s tempting to be critical of their murmuring or complaining, but as you read, consider whether you have ever done the same thing. What do you learn from the Israelites’ experiences that can help you murmur less and trust God more? What do these verses teach you about God?\nSee also\n1 Nephi 2:11–12\n.\nThe Israelites gathering manna.

For example, what do you find in the Lord’s instructions in\nExodus 16:16, 19, 22–26\nthat applies to your spiritual nourishment?\nTo discover other lessons the Lord may want you to learn from this miracle, ponder questions like these:\nWhat does the Lord give me that is like the daily manna that He gave the Israelites?\nWhat can I do that is like gathering manna?\nYou may find additional insights in one or more of these videos: “Daily Bread: Pattern,” “Daily Bread: Experience,” and “Daily Bread: Change” (Gospel Library).\n2:52\nDaily Bread: Pattern\n3:12\nDaily Bread: Experience\n3:0\nDaily Bread: Change\nThink of other things, besides eating, that you do every day.

(see\nJohn 4:10–14\n;\n1 Corinthians 10:1–4\n;\n1 Nephi 11:25\n).\nLook for physical objects that testify of Christ.\nWhenever the scriptures describe things that could be symbols of Jesus Christ, like\nExodus 17:1–7\ndoes, it might be an opportunity for an object lesson. Looking at or touching a rock or water can make it easier to understand how these objects are like Jesus Christ.

Consider telling your children about an experience when the Holy Ghost told you something in your mind or heart, and invite them to talk about their experiences. You could also sing a song about the Holy Ghost, such as “\nLet the Holy Spirit Guide\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 143).\nExodus 15:22–25\nThe Lord can make bitter things sweet.\nMaybe you and your children could drink something sweet and something bitter while studying\nExodus 15:22–25\ntogether.

What do these stories remind us about what Jesus Christ does for us? As part of your discussion, you might read\nMatthew 7:24–27\n;\nJohn 4:10–14\n;\n6:29–35, 48–51\n;\nHelaman 5:12\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n.\nOne Before God\n, by Joseph Brickey (detail)\nExodus 17:8–16\n;\n18:13–26\nI can help “bear the burden” of doing the Lord’s work.\nAs you read\nExodus 17:8–16\n, you could invite a child to hold their hands high in the air. When the child gets tired, other children could help, the way Aaron and Hur helped Moses. What does this story teach about how we can help God’s kingdom be successful? You could also read\nExodus 18:13–26\nand talk about the heavy responsibilities of people who serve in your ward.

      "content": "\n--- Lesson 45 ---\nWe might feel hopeless at times, similar to how the Israelites might have felt while trapped between the Red Sea and Pharaoh’s army. However, Moses’s counsel to them still applies to us today: “Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord” ( Exodus 14:13 ). This lesson can help students feel the desire to place their trust in the Lord for strength and deliverance. Student preparation: Invite students to study Exodus 14:13–14 and to consider aspects of their lives where these verses could help. Possible Learning Activities Surrounded by trials Help students reflect on challenges in their lives that can make them feel overwhelmed or trapped. One way to do this is to share the following statement from Brother Milton Camargo of the Sunday School General Presidency. You could write his father’s advice in the center of the board. Brother Milton Camargo, First Counselor in the Sunday School General Presidency, shared advice from his father: My father used to tell me, “Don’t focus so intensely on your problems that you can’t see the solution.” (“ Focus on Jesus Christ ,” Liahona , May 2023, 64) Ask students to share what they think Brother Camargo’s father was teaching. Then invite them to write around the statement on the board any problems, challenges, or trials that may be difficult for them to see solutions to. Students could answer the first of the following questions aloud. With the second question, it may be wise to invite them to quietly ponder their answers. Ponder times when you may have felt there was no solution to the problems you have faced. What are some ways a person might respond in such circumstances? How do you normally respond under such circumstances? As you study Exodus 14 today, seek inspiration from the Holy Ghost to help you increase your desire to trust in the Lord as you face or prepare to face challenges and trials. The Israelites’ predicament To help students understand the Israelites’ situation in Exodus 14 , display or help them locate map 2 in the Bible Maps, found in the Latter-day Saint edition of the King James Bible. As you share the following paragraph, invite students to locate Pi-hahiroth (#3) on the map. As the children of Israel left Egypt, the Lord commanded Moses to lead them to Pi-hahiroth ( Exodus 14:2 ). Shortly after letting the Israelites go, Pharaoh realized that “the wilderness had shut them in” ( Exodus 14:3 ), so he hardened his heart and pursued after them. President Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained the following about the Israelites’ circumstances. The children of Israel [were in a] horrible predicament. … There were chariots behind them, sand dunes on every side, and a lot of water immediately ahead. … In this case it was literally a matter of life and death. (“ Cast Not Away Therefore Your Confidence ,” Ensign , Mar. 2000, 9) To help students visualize this account, you could show them the following image of the Red Sea. Invite them to imagine they were among the Israelites at this moment. How might you have responded under these circumstances? Consider inviting students to compare and contrast the Israelites’ response to their circumstances with Moses’s response. Noting similarities and differences between people, teachings, and events in the scriptures is an important scripture study skill. Making these comparisons can help students identify important gospel truths that they might not see otherwise. You might want to briefly explain the skill of comparing and contrasting. Invite students to practice it in the following study activity. In your study journal, create a small chart with two columns. Label one column Israelites and the other Moses . Read Exodus 14:10–14 , looking for what the Israelites said and what Moses said. Summarize what you find in the appropriate column. What did the Israelites focus on in these circumstances? What did Moses focus on? What do you notice by comparing what they said? What do you learn from this account that could help you with your challenges? Among other truths students may share, help them see the following: Focusing on Jesus Christ can increase our hope during challenges and trials. What problems do you think can happen if we only focus on our challenges and trials? Focusing on Christ Consider sharing the rest of Brother Camargo’s statement from the beginning of the lesson. Brother Camargo shared the following about the power of focusing on Jesus Christ: My father used to tell me, “Don’t focus so intensely on your problems that you can’t see the solution.” I testify that the Lord Jesus Christ is the solution to even our most difficult problems. (“ Focus on Jesus Christ ,” Liahona , May 2023, 64) Why do you think focusing on Jesus Christ is helpful when we feel surrounded or trapped by our challenges or trials? To demonstrate what Brother Camargo taught, invite students to first focus their mind on the challenges they wrote on the board. Have them focus on those challenges for 30 seconds. Then ask them to ponder how they feel. Next, place a picture of Jesus Christ at the front of the class. Invite students to solely focus their thoughts on His power and love for 30 seconds. Invite students to write their answers to the following question in their study journals. What difference might you notice when you focus on Jesus Christ and His power more than the challenges you are facing? Display the questions below, and separate students into pairs or small groups. Invite them to choose two or three of the challenges on the board and to discuss these questions. In what ways can Jesus Christ be a solution to the problems, challenges, or trials you chose? How can a person act with faith in Jesus Christ during that specific problem, challenge, or trial? Invite willing students to share what they learned or felt. The Lord’s mighty power Consider having students read the following verses individually or in partnerships. Students could also draw what they read in their study journals. If it is beneficial for your students, you could invite several students to briefly act out verses 19–22. For example, you could create a small barrier that can be removed or separated, allowing the students to walk through. Another option is to show the animated video “ The Passover ” from time code 1:28 to 2:32. This video is found on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 2:54 Read Exodus 14:15–31 , looking for how the Lord fought for and delivered the Israelites. What inspires you about this account? What did you find that helps you want to place your trust in the Lord? Personal strength and deliverance The next question may initially be difficult for students to answer. Hearing the experiences of others can help them think of their own. You might want to share an experience you or someone you know has had that could help answer the question. Or show a video such as the following that depicts the importance of focusing on the Savior during our trials: “ Finding Christ During Difficult Times ” (4:35) “ Feeling the Lord’s Love and Goodness in Trials ” (4:18) Both videos are available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 4:35 4:17 How has focusing on Jesus Christ during a challenge or trial helped you or someone you know? Help students see that sometimes we may not be delivered from our challenges in the ways we expect. However, focusing on Jesus Christ can help us find hope and strength no matter what we are facing. Consider ending by sharing your testimony of Jesus Christ and of the importance of focusing on Him in our trials. You may consider including the statement below with your testimony. Brother Camargo testified that the Savior can help us: The Lord Jesus Christ lives today. He can be an active, daily presence in our lives. He is the solution to our problems, but we must lift our eyes and raise our sights to see Him. He has said, “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not” [ Doctrine and Covenants 6:36 ]. (“ Focus on Jesus Christ ,” Liahona , May 2023, 67)\n\n\n--- Lesson 46 ---\nGod often uses physical experiences to teach essential spiritual lessons. For example, God used the Israelites’ needs for water and for help in battle to teach them and us. Through practice and the guidance of the Spirit, we can learn to identify and apply the spiritual truths in scripture accounts to our lives. This lesson can help students practice identifying truths from God in scripture accounts and connecting those truths to their lives. Student preparation: Invite students to reflect on the accounts they have studied from the Old Testament and the Pearl of Great Price so far this semester. Ask them to come to class prepared to share how they would complete the following sentence: “I like the account of because it teaches me that .” Possible Learning Activities Identifying gospel truths in the scriptures In this lesson, students will have the chance to find and share various gospel truths. It may be helpful to remind students that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are the source of all gospel truths. Explain that learning how to find and apply gospel truths can help us draw nearer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. To begin the lesson, consider asking students how they would fill in the blanks in the sentence below. If a visual reminder of some of the accounts you’ve studied would be helpful, you might display images like the ones below. Or invite students to look through images of the Old Testament in the Gospel Art Book [2009], which can be found in Gospel Library under “Videos and Images.” Complete the following sentence with a scripture account of your choice: “I like the account of because it teaches me that .” As volunteers share with the class, they could write the truths they identify on the board. The truths they share may be stated as doctrine, such as “We are children of God” (see Moses 1:1–7 ). Or they may be stated as principles that can be applied, such as “If we are willing to be led by God, He will increase our ability to accomplish His work” (see Moses 6:31–36 ). You might also ask students who share to explain why the truth they wrote is important in their lives. As the teacher, try not to give your own response to every student’s comment. It can be helpful to ask the class to share what they learned from another student’s comment. This can help students discover their own thoughts and feelings through the influence of the Holy Ghost. For additional training on this, see “ Help learners take responsibility for their learning ” in Teacher Development Skills [2022]. As students share, you might point out that there is an important difference between liking a scripture account and finding relevant truths from God in that account. Explain that as they prayerfully seek the Spirit’s guidance in their scripture study, Heavenly Father will help them find the truths that are the most relevant to them. After students are done sharing, invite them to reflect on their efforts to identify truths in their personal scripture study. You might use the following prompts. Record your answers to the following questions in your study journal. Is your personal scripture study helping you grow closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Why or why not? How often do you pause during your scripture study to identify truths that you feel Heavenly Father wants you to focus on? Do you seek to understand how scripture accounts apply to your life? As you study accounts from Exodus 15 and 17 today, pay attention to inspired thoughts and feelings from the Spirit. Look for impressions that could help you get more out of your personal scripture study. Identifying gospel truths from Exodus 15, 17 In this section of the lesson, students will have the chance to identify and find relevant truths from the account of the Lord caring for the Israelites in the wilderness. Consider dividing the class into partnerships. Assign similar numbers of partnerships to study each of the accounts in the handout. You might assign students with less experience studying the scriptures to work with students who have more experience. Be sure to give partnerships enough time to discuss and prepare. You could walk around and help students who might need a little extra direction. Open PDF After sufficient time to study, discuss, and prepare, give partnerships the opportunity to share what they learned. The following are ways students might share depending on available time: Each pair shares with a pair that studied a different account. They then rotate one more time to share with a partnership who studied the remaining account. Partnerships first get together and share with others who studied the same account. (This could give students additional insights about their own account.) Then students get together and share in groups of six, with each partnership having studied different accounts. Partnerships take turns presenting what they prepared to the entire class. Personalizing the lesson To conclude the lesson, consider using prompts like the following to help students personalize what they learned. Record your thoughts about the following in your study journal: What do you feel Heavenly Father would like you to remember from this lesson? Why? How could you use the skill of identifying truths from scripture accounts in your personal scripture study? How might using this skill affect your experience with the scriptures? You might invite volunteers to share part of what they wrote in their study journals. Also, consider looking for opportunities in upcoming lessons to invite students to share truths they are learning from their personal scripture study.\n\n\n--- Lesson 47 ---\nAfter the Lord delivered His people from Egypt, they encountered new challenges and opportunities for growth. The Israelites could no longer rely on the Egyptians to provide necessities like food and water. They needed to learn to rely on the Lord for their daily needs. This lesson can help students rely on the Lord daily. Student preparation: Invite students to look for evidence of the Lord’s power in their lives between now and the next class. Encourage them to take time in their personal or family prayers to thank Heavenly Father for His help. Possible Learning Activities The need for daily nourishment Consider beginning class by discussing things our bodies need every day. For example, you could display some bread. Invite a student who is hungry to come to the front of the class and eat some of the bread. As the student eats, ask him or her the following questions: When did you last eat? If you recently ate, why are you hungry now? Why do we have to eat regularly? Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles compared feeding our physical bodies to caring for our spirits: We all recognize the need for physical sustenance. Hunger and thirst remind us very strongly if we forget. But the spiritual need for sustenance is equally strong. (“ Daily Bread: Pattern ,” Gospel Library) Why do you think the need to feed our spirits is as important as caring for our bodies? Why can it be easy to overlook our spiritual needs? Take some time to ponder the following questions. Consider recording your thoughts in your study journal: Do you feel the same desire to care for your spirit every day as you do for your body? Why or why not? What do you feel Heavenly Father would have you do each day to care for your spirit? Seek inspiration to know what you can continue to do, or what you can change, to provide your spirit with the daily strength from the Lord that it needs. Relying on the Lord daily After crossing the Red Sea, the Israelites “believed the Lord, and his servant Moses” ( Exodus 14:31 ). They sang and danced to praise the Lord for delivering them (see Exodus 15:1–21 ). However, the Israelites’ praise of the Lord did not last long. While Moses led them toward Mount Sinai, they faced various problems, and their faith was tested. Read Exodus 16:2–4, 11–15 , looking for how the Lord provided for the Israelites’ needs. What did you find? Consider inviting students to mark the word “manna” in Exodus 16:15 and to cross-reference or link it to John 6:47–51 . Read John 6:31–35, 47–51 , looking for what Jesus taught about manna. In what ways is manna similar to Jesus Christ? How is what Jesus offers us infinitely better than manna? Encourage students to focus on Jesus Christ as they study about manna. One way to do this is to provide students with the handout titled “Bread from Heaven.” Students could complete the handout individually or in small groups. Alternatively, you could invite small groups of students to read Exodus 16:14–31, 35 and to create a quiz about manna. They could write 3–4 questions that could be answered by reading the verses. Groups could then exchange quizzes with another group. Open PDF Share the correct answers after students have finished: 1. True; 2. False; 3. False; 4. True; 5. True; 6. False; 7. True; 8. False. How might these details about manna apply to our need for spiritual nourishment? What can these details about manna teach you about receiving the spiritual nourishment from Jesus Christ? Students may have discovered many valuable truths. They could share why they feel the truths they identified are important. You could also ask other follow-up questions. The rest of this lesson will focus on the following truth: when we rely on the Lord daily, He will bless us with the spiritual nourishment we need . ( Note: Students will reflect on their desire to rely on the Lord in Lesson 55: “ Assess Your Learning 3 .” If you feel impressed to focus on a different truth for the remainder of this lesson, be sure to make corresponding adaptations when you teach Lesson 55.) To deepen students’ understanding of our daily need for Jesus Christ, you could share the following statement or watch “ Daily Bread: Pattern ” (2:51), available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org . 2:52 Elder Christofferson spoke of our need for daily spiritual nourishment from the Lord: We ought not to think that we can go weeks and months without spiritual sustenance and not suffer and not have a deadening influence in our spiritual life. Acknowledging the reality of our need for a daily spiritual administration, or manna, helps us increase in our courage to do the right thing and to serve others more than we would have if we ignored God. (“ Daily Bread: Pattern ,” Gospel Library) Why is relying on the Lord each day better than occasional, powerful spiritual experiences? Daily bread Provide the following instructions. In addition to the suggested scripture passages, students could look for statements from Church leaders by searching words or phrases such as “daily” or “each day” in the Gospel Library. In your study journal, label a page “Daily Bread: Jesus Christ.” In the middle of the page, draw a loaf of bread. Study the following scriptures, looking for things we can do every day to rely on the Lord and receive spiritual nourishment. Write what you find around your drawing of bread. Deuteronomy 8:3 1 Nephi 17:3 2 Nephi 32:3 Alma 37:36–37 Invite students to discuss what they discovered by asking questions such as the following. You could encourage students to add ideas to their study journals as they learn from their classmates. Which of these actions have helped you invite the Bread of Life, Jesus Christ, into your life daily? How has He nourished or strengthened you as a result? In addition to what you found in the scriptures, what other things do you try to do each day to rely on the Lord? What would you say to someone who feels they don’t need to do these things? If time allows, consider singing a hymn with the class about our need for the Lord, such as “ I Need Thee Every Hour ” ( Hymns , no. 98). Students could share lines from the hymn that are meaningful to them. Look at the list that you wrote around the bread in your study journal. Circle one or two ideas you feel the Lord would have you start doing or do differently to better rely on Him each day. Then answer the following: When and where will you do this thing each day? What challenges will you need to overcome to make this habit a part of your daily routine? How will you overcome these challenges? How do you think doing this thing every day might affect your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ over time? Conclude by sharing your thoughts and feelings about our need to rely on the Lord each day. Look for opportunities in future lessons to follow up on students’ efforts. You could also periodically update your students on your daily efforts to rely on the Lord.",

And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?\n6. And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:\n7. And he took six hundred chosenchariots, andall the chariotsof Egypt, and captains over every one of them.\n8.

And when Pharaoh drew nigh,the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto theLord.\n11. And they said unto Moses, Becausethere wereno graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away todiein the wilderness? wherefore hast thoudealtthus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?\n12. Isnot this thewordthat we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? Forit had beenbetter for us toservethe Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.\n13. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of theLord, which he willshew to youto day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.\n14. TheLordshallfightfor you, and ye shall hold yourpeace.\n15. And theLordsaid unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:\n16.

And theangelof God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and thepillarof the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:\n20. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel;andit was cloud anddarknessto them,but it gave light by nightto these:so that the one came not near the other all the night.\n21. And Moses stretched out his hand over thesea; and theLordcausedtheseatogobackby strong east wind all that night, and made the seadryland,and thewatersweredivided.\n22. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dryground:and the waterswerea wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.\n23. And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea,evenall Pharaohs horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.\n24. And it came to pass, that in the morning watch theLordlooked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,\n25. Andtookoff their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said,Let us flee from the face of Israel; for theLordfighteth for them against the Egyptians.\n26. And theLordsaid unto Moses, Stretch out thinehandover the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.\n27.

And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, whichisbetween Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.\n2. And the whole congregation of the children of Israelmurmuredagainst Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:\n3. And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of theLordin the land of Egypt, when we sat by theflesh pots,andwhen we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly withhunger.\n4. Then said theLordunto Moses, Behold, I will rainbreadfrom heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather certainrateevery day, that I mayprovethem, whether they willwalkin my law, or no.\n5. And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall preparethatwhich they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.\n6. And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that theLordhath brought you out from the land of Egypt:\n7. And in the morning, then ye shall see thegloryof theLord; for that he heareth your murmurings against theLord: and whatarewe, that ye murmur against us?\n8.

And Mosesspakeunto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before theLord: for he hath heard your murmurings.\n10. And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, thegloryof theLordappeared in thecloud.\n11.

Thisisthe thing which theLordhath commanded, Gather of it every manaccordingtohis eating, anomerfor every man,according tothe number of your persons; take ye every man forthemwhicharein his tents.\n17. And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.\n18. And when they did meteitwith an omer, he thatgatheredmuch had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.\n19. And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.\n20. Notwithstanding theyhearkenednot unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.\n21. And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sunwaxedhot, it melted.\n22. And it came to pass,thaton the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for oneman:and all the rulers of thecongregationcame and told Moses.\n23. And he said unto them, Thisis thatwhich theLordhath said, To morrowisthe rest of the holysabbathunto theLord:bakethatwhich ye will baketo day,andseethethat ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.\n24. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.\n25. And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to dayisa sabbath unto theLord: to day ye shall not find it in the field.\n26. Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day,which isthe sabbath, in it there shall be none.\n27. And it came to pass,thatthere went outsomeof the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.\n28. And theLordsaid unto Moses, How long refuse ye tokeepmy commandments and my laws?\n29. See, for that theLordhath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.\n30. So the people rested on the seventh day.\n31. And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and itwaslikecorianderseed, white; and the taste of itwaslike wafersmadewith honey.\n32.

And theLordsaid unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thyrod,wherewiththou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.\n6. Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shaltsmitetherock, and there shall comewaterout of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.\n7. And he called the name of the placeMassah, andMeribah, because of thechidingof the children of Israel, and because they tempted theLord, saying, Is theLordamong us, or not?\n8. Then cameAmalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.\n9. And Moses said untoJoshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with therodof God in mine hand.\n10. So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.\n11. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.\n12. But Moses handswereheavy; and they took stone, and putitunder him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hurstayed uphis hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.\n13. And JoshuadiscomfitedAmalek and his people with the edge of the sword.\n14. And theLordsaid unto Moses, Write thisfora memorial in abook, and rehearseitin the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance ofAmalekfrom under heaven.\n15. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of itJehovah-nissi:\n16. For he said,BecausetheLordhath swornthattheLordwill havewar with Amalek from generation to generation.",

      "content": "1. WhenJethro, thepriestofMidian, Moses father in law, heard of all thatGodhad done for Moses, and for Israel his people,andthat theLordhad brought Israel out of Egypt;\n2. Then Jethro, Moses father in law, tookZipporah, Moses wife, after he had sent her back,\n3. And her twosons; of which the name of the onewasGershom; for he said,Ihave been an alien in strange land:\n4. And the name of the otherwasEliezer; for the God of my father,said he, wasmine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:\n5. And Jethro, Moses father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at themount of God:\n6. And hesaidunto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.\n7. And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other oftheirwelfare; and they came into the tent.\n8. And Moses told his father in law all that theLordhad done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israels sake,andall the travail that had come upon them by the way, andhowtheLorddelivered them.\n9. And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which theLordhad done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.\n10. And Jethro said, BlessedbetheLord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.\n11. Now I know that theLordisgreater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealtproudlyhe wasabove them.\n12. And Jethro, Moses father in law, took burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eatbreadwith Moses father in law before God.\n13. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat tojudgethe people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.\n14. And when Moses father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, Whatisthis thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?\n15. And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me toinquireof God:\n16. When they have amatter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do makethemknow the statutes of God, and his laws.\n17. And Moses father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doestisnot good.\n18. Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people thatiswith thee: for this thingistooheavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.\n19. Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee:Bethou for the people toGod-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:\n20. And thou shaltteachthemordinancesandlaws, and shalt shew them thewaywherein they mustwalk, and the work that they must do.\n21. Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the peopleablemen, such asfearGod,men of truth, hatingcovetousness; and placesuchover them,to berulersof thousands,andrulers ofhundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:\n22. And let themjudgethe people at all seasons: and it shall be,thatevery great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall beartheburdenwith thee.\n23. If thou shalt do this thing, and God command theeso,then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.\n24. So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.\n25. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made themheadsover the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.\n26. And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\n27. And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.",
