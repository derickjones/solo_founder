      "thought": "This week, as we study Genesis 18–23, we dive into the lives of Abraham and Sarah, who faced challenges that tested their faith in God’s promises. Their story reminds us that God’s timing and ways often differ from our own, yet His power is limitless. From the miraculous birth of Isaac to the heart-wrenching test of sacrifice, we see how trust in God can carry us through the impossible. These chapters also warn us to flee wickedness and not look back, as Lot’s family learned. As we explore these accounts, let’s reflect on our own willingness to trust God, no matter the circumstances. What can we learn from their examples of faith and obedience?",
      "application": "Take a moment today to write down one promise from God that you are waiting to see fulfilled, and pray for patience and trust in His timing.",
      "question": "How can Abraham and Sarah’s story inspire me to trust God even when His promises seem far off?"

      "scripture": {
        "reference": "Genesis 17:15-16",
        "text": "And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her."
      },
      "thought": "Abraham and Sarah waited many years for the promise of a child, and at times, it must have seemed impossible. Yet God reassured them with a specific promise—Sarah would be a mother of nations. Their story teaches us that God fulfills His promises, even if it takes longer than we expect or happens in ways we don’t anticipate. When we face delays or doubts in our own lives, we can remember their example of faith. God’s power is not limited by our circumstances or timelines. Let their trust inspire us to hold on to hope.",
      "application": "Identify one area in your life where you’re waiting for a blessing, and write a short note of gratitude to God for His faithfulness, even before you see the outcome.",
      "question": "What helps me maintain faith when God’s promises seem delayed or impossible?"

      },
      "thought": "The angels’ urgent command to Lot and his family to flee Sodom and not look back is a powerful reminder to escape wickedness in our own lives. Their warning shows God’s mercy in providing a way out, but also the importance of immediate obedience. Lot’s wife, who looked back longingly, teaches us that clinging to past sins or worldly desires can hold us back from God’s protection. Today, we face temptations that pull us toward spiritual danger. This story encourages us to turn away from evil influences and move forward with faith in the Savior. Let’s heed the call to escape and keep our eyes on God’s path.",
      "application": "Identify one negative influence or habit in your life today, and take one specific step to distance yourself from it, such as limiting screen time or avoiding certain environments.",
      "question": "What temptations or past habits am I tempted to ‘look back’ on, and how can I focus forward on Christ instead?"

      },
      "thought": "God’s command to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac must have been heartbreaking, yet it was a profound test of his faith and obedience. This story mirrors Heavenly Father’s willingness to offer His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, for us. Abraham’s trust in God, even in this unthinkable moment, shows us that true faith means surrendering everything to Him. While we may not face such a dramatic test, we are often asked to sacrifice our time, desires, or comforts for God’s will. This account invites us to examine our own willingness to trust God completely. How can we show that kind of faith in our daily choices?",
      "application": "Choose one thing you can sacrifice today—perhaps time spent on a hobby—to serve someone in need or spend time in prayer.",
      "question": "What am I holding back from God, and how can I trust Him more fully with it?"

      },
      "thought": "At the critical moment when Abraham was prepared to sacrifice Isaac, God provided a ram as a substitute, showing His mercy and care. This moment reminds us that God always has a plan, even when we can’t see it. Just as He provided for Abraham, He provides for us in our trials, often in unexpected ways. This story can build our hope that God will help us through our challenges, whether they are big or small. When we feel overwhelmed, we can trust that He sees our needs and will offer solutions. Let’s look for His hand in our lives today.",
      "application": "Take a moment today to notice and write down one way God has provided for you recently, no matter how small it seems.",
      "question": "How have I seen God provide for me in unexpected ways during difficult times?"

      },
      "thought": "After Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac, God reaffirmed His covenant blessings, promising to multiply Abraham’s seed and bless all nations through him. This reminds us that obedience to God’s commands brings incredible promises, even if we don’t see the full results in our lifetime. The covenant with Abraham extends to us as we strive to live faithfully. Our obedience today connects us to God’s eternal plan and blessings. We can trust that our small acts of faith contribute to His greater purposes. Let’s commit to following Him, knowing His promises are sure.",
      "application": "Choose one commandment or prompting to act on today with extra diligence, such as keeping the Sabbath holy or following a personal inspiration.",
      "question": "How does my obedience to God’s commands strengthen my connection to His covenant promises?"

      "thought": "This week in Genesis 18–23, we’ve seen the powerful examples of Abraham, Sarah, and Lot’s family as they navigated faith, obedience, and sacrifice. From Sarah’s long-awaited blessing of a son to Abraham’s willingness to offer Isaac, we’ve learned that nothing is too hard for the Lord. Lot’s story taught us to flee wickedness and keep our focus forward on Christ. These accounts remind us to trust God’s timing, obey His commands, and hope in His promises, even in our hardest moments. As we reflect on these lessons, let’s carry forward a renewed commitment to trust Him. How has this week’s study deepened your faith in God’s power and love?",
