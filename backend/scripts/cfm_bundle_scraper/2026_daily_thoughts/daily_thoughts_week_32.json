      "thought": "This week, we dive into the remarkable story of Esther, a young Jewish woman who became queen of Persia at a critical moment in history. Her journey teaches us that what may seem like coincidence is often part of God’s divine plan. As Elder Ronald A. Rasband taught, the Lord is in the small details of our lives, guiding us to be in the right place at the right time. Esther’s courage and faith remind us that we, too, are placed where we can make a difference. Let’s explore how her story can inspire us to trust in God’s timing and purpose for our own lives. As we study, consider how the Lord has prepared you ‘for such a time as this.’",
      "application": "Take a moment today to write down one way you feel the Lord has placed you in a specific situation or relationship to help others.",
      "question": "How have you seen God’s hand in the ‘small details’ of your life that led you to bless someone else?"

      "title": "Trusting Through Fasting",
      "scripture": {
        "reference": "Esther 4:16",
        "text": "Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish."
      },
      "thought": "Esther faced an impossible situation—approaching the king uninvited could mean death, yet her people’s lives depended on her courage. In this moment, she turned to fasting, asking the Jews to join her in seeking the Lord’s strength and guidance. Fasting was a powerful expression of her trust in God, and it brought miraculous results as the king received her favorably. Like Esther, we can rely on the Lord through fasting when we face challenges beyond our control. It helps us draw closer to Heavenly Father and invites His blessings into our lives. How might fasting strengthen your faith in a current trial?",
      "application": "Choose an upcoming fast Sunday to focus on a specific need or concern, and prepare for it by praying about how you can make it meaningful.",
      "question": "What is one challenge in your life where fasting could help you feel closer to the Lord’s guidance?"

        "reference": "Esther 5:2",
        "text": "And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre."
      },
      "thought": "Esther’s decision to approach the king without being summoned required immense courage, as it could have cost her life. Yet, she acted in faith, trusting that the Lord would guide her steps. When the king extended his scepter, it was a sign of favor and protection—a reminder that God was with her. We may not face life-or-death situations like Esther, but standing up for what is right often requires bravery. Whether it’s speaking up for truth or defending a friend, we can draw on the same divine strength that supported Esther. Her example shows us that courage rooted in faith can lead to miracles.",
      "application": "Identify one situation this week where you can stand up for what is right, even if it feels uncomfortable, and pray for courage to act.",
      "question": "When have you felt the Lord give you courage to do something difficult, and how did it turn out?"

      },
      "thought": "Mordecai’s words to Esther remind us that God places us where we are for a reason. Esther became queen at a pivotal time to save her people, showing how she was an instrument in God’s hands. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught that each of us has a unique task only we can perform. We might not always see our purpose as clearly as Esther did, but the Lord guides us to touch specific lives in ways no one else can. Reflect on your own circumstances—are there people or situations where you are uniquely positioned to help? Trust that God has prepared you for your own ‘time as this.’",
      "application": "Reach out to someone in your circle today—family, friend, or neighbor—and offer a kind word or small act of service.",
      "question": "What unique gifts or opportunities do you have right now that could help you serve as an instrument in God’s hands?"

        "reference": "Esther 3:5",
        "text": "And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath."
      },
      "thought": "Haman’s story in the book of Esther serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and anger. His wrath over Mordecai’s refusal to bow led him to seek the destruction of an entire people, revealing a heart driven by self-importance. Ultimately, his prideful actions brought about his own downfall. This reminds us to examine our own motivations—are we acting out of love and humility, or are we letting pride or anger guide us? Heavenly Father can help us change if we turn to Him. Let’s strive to replace pride with compassion in our daily interactions.",
      "application": "Reflect on a recent moment of frustration or anger and pray for help to respond with humility instead next time.",
      "question": "How can I recognize pride in my thoughts or actions, and what steps can I take to cultivate humility?"

      },
      "thought": "Mordecai’s care for Esther, an orphaned family member, shows us the importance of serving those closest to us. He took her in as his own daughter, providing love and support during a difficult time in her life. This act of kindness reminds us that family is often where our service begins. We may not always realize the impact of small acts of help, but they can make a big difference. Like Mordecai, we can look for ways to lift and strengthen our family members. Who in your family might need your care or attention today?",
      "application": "Do something specific to help a family member today, like helping with a chore or spending extra time listening to them.",
      "question": "Who in my family could use my help right now, and how can I show them I care?"

But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
      },
      "thought": "As we conclude our study of Esther this week, we see how her courage and faith led to a ‘day of gladness’ for her people. From fasting and bravery to serving family and recognizing our purpose, Esther’s story teaches us that God prepares us for specific moments to bless others. Her journey shows that what may seem like coincidence is often the Lord’s hand in our lives. We’ve also learned from Haman’s pride to seek humility in our own hearts. Reflect on how these lessons can shape your actions moving forward. Trust that, like Esther, you are here ‘for such a time as this’ to do the Lord’s work.",
      "application": "Write down one key lesson from Esther’s story that you want to apply in your life, and set a goal to act on it this coming week.",
      "question": "How has studying Esther this week helped me see God’s purpose for me in my current circumstances?"
