      "thought": "This week, we dive into the journey of the Israelites in Numbers, where their 40-year wander in the wilderness teaches us about spiritual growth. Their story isn’t just about physical travel but about transforming into God’s covenant people. Like them, we often find ourselves in a spiritual wilderness, needing to learn lessons of faith, trust, and obedience. Their experiences with rebellion, fear, and eventual hope remind us of our own path toward eternal life with Heavenly Father. Key themes include trusting God’s prophet, looking to Christ for healing, and staying faithful amidst pressure. Let’s explore how these ancient lessons can guide us today.",
      "application": "Take a moment today to write down one spiritual goal for this week inspired by the Israelites’ journey, such as trusting God more fully.",
      "question": "What spiritual wilderness am I currently facing, and how can this week’s study help me move forward?"

        "text": "And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the Lord’s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!"
      },
      "thought": "In Numbers 11, Moses expresses a beautiful wish that all of God’s people could be prophets, receiving personal revelation. This teaches us that revelation isn’t reserved for a few—God wants to speak to each of us through the Spirit. However, as we learn in Numbers 12, personal revelation doesn’t replace the unique role of God’s chosen prophet. We can seek guidance for our lives, but we must also follow the prophet’s counsel for the Church. This balance helps us stay aligned with God’s will. How comforting to know that Heavenly Father is eager to guide us personally while providing a prophet to lead His people!",
      "application": "Spend five minutes today in quiet prayer, asking for personal revelation about a specific concern, and write down any impressions you receive.",
      "question": "How can I better balance seeking personal revelation with following the prophet’s guidance?"

      },
      "thought": "Joshua and Caleb’s courage in Numbers 14 stands out as they urge the Israelites not to fear the inhabitants of Canaan but to trust in the Lord’s power. While others saw giants and insurmountable challenges, Caleb and Joshua saw God’s promises and protection. Their faith gave them hope for the future, even when the majority wanted to return to Egypt. We, too, face situations that seem overwhelming, tempting us to shrink back in fear. Their example reminds us to focus on God’s strength rather than our obstacles. Let their faith inspire us to move forward with trust in Heavenly Father.",

        "text": "And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived."
      },
      "thought": "In Numbers 21, the Israelites were bitten by fiery serpents, but God provided a way for healing through a brass serpent on a pole—they only needed to look at it. This story symbolizes Jesus Christ, who heals us from the bites of sin and spiritual pain when we look to Him in faith. Some refused to look, just as we sometimes resist turning to the Savior. Book of Mormon prophets teach that this simple act of looking represents faith in Christ’s Atonement. We can find healing today by focusing on Him. What a powerful reminder that salvation is within reach if we turn to Jesus!",
      "application": "Choose one way to ‘look to Christ’ today, such as reading a chapter in the Book of Mormon or singing a hymn about the Savior.",

      },
      "thought": "Balaam’s initial response to Balak in Numbers 22 shows a determination to follow God’s will, even when offered riches and honor to curse Israel. His words remind us that no worldly reward is worth disobeying the Lord. Though Balaam later faltered, his early resolve can inspire us to stand firm against pressures to compromise our values. We often face temptations to stray from God’s path, whether from peers, media, or personal desires. Balaam’s example encourages us to prioritize God’s voice over worldly offers. Let’s commit to following His will, no matter the cost.",

      },
      "thought": "In Numbers 11, the Israelites complained about manna, forgetting the miracle of God’s daily provision and the many blessings they’d received. Their ingratitude led to dissatisfaction, a trap we can fall into when we overlook Heavenly Father’s gifts in our lives. Focusing on what we lack can blind us to the abundance around us. The Lord has given us so much—family, the gospel, and even small daily mercies. Taking time to recognize these blessings can shift our perspective and fill our hearts with joy. Let’s choose gratitude over grumbling today.",

      },
      "thought": "This week in Numbers, we’ve seen the Israelites’ struggles and triumphs in the wilderness, reflecting our own spiritual journey. From Moses’s meekness to Caleb and Joshua’s faith, we’ve learned to trust God and His prophet. The brass serpent taught us to look to Christ for healing, while Balaam’s story reminded us to obey despite pressure. Gratitude for God’s blessings can keep us grounded, as we avoid the Israelites’ mistake of complaining. These lessons prepare us for our promised land—eternal life with Heavenly Father.
