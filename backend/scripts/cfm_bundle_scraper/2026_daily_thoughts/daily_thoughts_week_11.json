      "thought": "This week, we dive into the remarkable story of Joseph, son of Jacob, in Genesis 37–41. Despite facing betrayal, slavery, and imprisonment, Joseph’s life shows us that the Lord never abandons His faithful children. We’ll explore how God was with Joseph through every trial, guiding him with dreams and strengthening him to resist temptation. His story reminds us that even when life feels unfair, God’s presence can bring purpose to our pain. As we study, let’s look for ways the Lord is with us in our own challenges. How can Joseph’s trust in God inspire us to hold fast to our faith?",
      "application": "Take a moment today to write down one challenge you’re facing and pray to feel the Lord’s presence in it.",
      "question": "How have I seen the Lord’s hand in my life during difficult times?"

        "reference": "Genesis 37:23-24",
        "text": "And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it."
      },
      "thought": "Joseph’s brothers betrayed him, stripping away his cherished coat and casting him into a pit. This moment of abandonment must have felt devastating, yet the Lord was still with Joseph, even in this dark hour. His story teaches us that bad things can happen, even when we strive to do right, but God never forsakes us. Like Joseph, we can trust that the Lord sees our struggles and has a plan for our deliverance. When we face our own ‘pits’ of hardship, we can turn to Him for strength. How can we feel His presence when life feels empty or unfair?",
      "application": "When you feel overwhelmed today, pause and say a silent prayer for strength, remembering God is near.",

        "text": "And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out."
      },
      "thought": "Joseph faced a powerful temptation when Potiphar’s wife tried to entice him into sin, but he chose to flee. His immediate action shows us the importance of not lingering in situations that could lead us astray. Even though his choice led to false accusations and prison, Joseph stayed true to God’s commandments. This reminds us that obedience might bring temporary hardship, but it keeps us close to the Lord. We can follow Joseph’s example by quickly turning away from temptation in our own lives. Whether it’s a thought, a place, or a choice, fleeing can protect our spiritual strength.",

        "text": "And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you."
      },
      "thought": "In prison, Joseph recognized that the ability to interpret dreams came from God, not himself. His humility and faith allowed the Lord to guide him in helping others understand divine messages. This teaches us that revelation often comes when we acknowledge our dependence on God. Like Joseph, we can seek the Lord’s help to understand His will for us, whether through prayer, scripture, or promptings. When life’s answers seem unclear, we can trust that God has the interpretation. How can we invite His guidance into our decisions today?",
      "application": "Spend five minutes in prayer today asking for clarity on a specific question or concern you have.",
      "question": "How can I better recognize and act on the Lord’s guidance in my life?"

And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine."
      },
      "thought": "Joseph’s interpretation of Pharaoh’s dream led to a wise plan to store food for the coming famine. His foresight, guided by the Lord, saved countless lives. This story reminds us that God can help us prepare for future challenges, both physical and spiritual. By listening to His counsel now—through prophets, scriptures, or personal revelation—we can build strength for hard times ahead. Just as Joseph stored grain, we can store faith, obedience, and trust in God. What can we do today to prepare for life’s uncertainties with hope?",
      "application": "Set aside time today to strengthen your spiritual reserves, such as reading a conference talk or adding to a gratitude journal.",

      },
      "thought": "Joseph’s brothers struggled with jealousy, leading to harsh words and actions against him. Their story shows how unkindness can hurt family relationships, but it also invites us to be peacemakers at home. We can choose to speak peaceably, even when we feel frustrated or misunderstood. Jesus Christ, the ultimate Peacemaker, teaches us to love and forgive within our families. By following His example, we can heal wounds and build trust. How can we show kindness to our family members, even in tense moments?",
      "application": "Make an effort to say something kind or encouraging to each family member today, even if it feels small.",
      "question": "How can I be a peacemaker in my family, especially during disagreements?"

      },
      "thought": "As we wrap up this week’s study of Genesis 37–41, Joseph’s life reminds us that the Lord is always near, even in our darkest moments. From betrayal by his brothers to resisting temptation and interpreting dreams, Joseph trusted God through every trial. We’ve seen how God guided him, prepared him for hardships, and blessed his faithfulness. His story encourages us to stay close to the Lord, flee temptation, and seek divine guidance. Let’s carry these lessons forward, trusting that God will show us mercy and favor as we face our own challenges. How has Joseph’s example strengthened your faith this week?",
