      "thought": "This week, we dive into the powerful words of Isaiah, a prophet whose messages echo through time, pointing us to Jesus Christ as our Savior. Isaiah 1–12 offers warnings about sin, promises of redemption, and visions of a glorious future with temples and the gathering of Israel. His prophecies remind us that God’s plan spans generations, offering hope and guidance for our day. As we study, we’ll see how Isaiah’s words apply to our lives, urging us to repent, trust in the Lord, and find peace in His house. Let’s open our hearts to the inspiration Isaiah provides, seeking personal revelation to understand his symbols and messages. Together, we can discover how God is truly our salvation.",
      "application": "Set a goal to read a chapter of Isaiah each day this week, noting one verse or idea that stands out to you.",

        "reference": "Isaiah 1:18",
        "text": "Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."
      },
      "thought": "Isaiah’s invitation to become clean through repentance is a powerful reminder of the Savior’s love and mercy. No matter how deep our mistakes, the Lord promises that through Him, we can be purified and renewed. This message counters Satan’s lie that we are too far gone to be forgiven. As we turn to Christ, we find hope and healing, becoming white as snow in His eyes. Isaiah’s words encourage us to trust in the Lord’s ability to transform us. Today, let’s reflect on how repentance brings us closer to Him and restores peace to our hearts.",
      "application": "Take a quiet moment to pray and ask for forgiveness for something specific, trusting in the Lord’s promise to make you clean.",
      "question": "How have I felt the Savior’s cleansing power in my life?"

        "text": "And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain."
      },
      "thought": "Isaiah describes the temple as a place of refuge, a shelter from life’s storms and heat. In our busy, often chaotic world, the temple offers peace and protection, a space to feel God’s presence. This prophecy points to the latter days when temples dot the earth, accessible to many of God’s children. As we attend or even think about the temple, we can find strength to face challenges. Isaiah’s vision reminds us that the Lord provides a safe haven through His house. Let’s hold this image of refuge in our hearts today.",
      "application": "Look at a picture of a temple or draw one with your family, discussing how it feels like a place of safety and peace.",

        "text": "If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established."
      },
      "thought": "During a time of political turmoil, Isaiah counseled King Ahaz to trust in the Lord rather than rely on alliances with other nations. This simple yet profound advice applies to us as well—when we face uncertainty, do we lean on our own understanding or on God’s promises? Isaiah reminds us that faith in the Lord establishes us, giving us a firm foundation to stand on. In our daily struggles, trusting Him can bring clarity and strength. Let’s remember that God’s power is greater than any challenge we face. Today, let’s choose faith over fear.",
      "application": "When faced with a decision today, pause and pray for guidance, choosing to trust in the Lord’s wisdom.",

        "text": "And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."
      },
      "thought": "Isaiah’s vision of the latter days shows temples as a beacon, drawing people from all nations to learn God’s ways. Today, we see this prophecy fulfilled as temples are built worldwide and families gather to worship there. The temple teaches us about Jesus Christ and helps us walk in His paths, bringing peace to our lives. This image of people flowing to the Lord’s house inspires us to prioritize worship and learning in His presence. As we think of the temple, we feel a pull to draw closer to God. Let’s cherish this sacred space and its role in our lives.",

      },
      "thought": "Isaiah’s prophecy of the Savior’s birth fills us with awe and gratitude as we consider the titles given to Jesus Christ. As the Prince of Peace, He brings calm to our troubled hearts and delivers us from despair. These words, spoken centuries before Christ’s birth, remind us of His eternal role in God’s plan to save us. In our daily struggles, we can turn to Him for guidance as our Counsellor and strength as our Mighty God. His peace is a gift we can seek through prayer and faith. Today, let’s celebrate the Deliverer who came to save us all.",
