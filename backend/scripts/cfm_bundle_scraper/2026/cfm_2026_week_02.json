    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\nThe Bible begins with the words “in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). But what was therebeforethis “beginning”? Andwhydid God create all of this? Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord has shed light on these questions.\n\nFor example, He gave us the record of a vision in which Abraham saw our existence as spirits “before the world was” (seeAbraham 3:22–28). The Lord also gave us an inspired translation or revision of the first six chapters of Genesis, called the book of Moses—which doesn’t begin with “in the beginning.” Instead, it begins with an experience Moses had that provides some context for the Creation story. Together, these latter-day scriptures are a good place to start our study of the Old Testament because they address some fundamental questions that can frame our reading: Who is God? Who are we? What is God’s work, and what is our place in it? The opening chapters of Genesis could be seen as the Lord’s response to Moses’s request: “Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens” (Moses 1:36).",

And as he was left unto himself, hefellunto the earth. 10And it came to pass that it was for the space of many hours before Moses did again receive his naturalstrengthlike unto man; and he said unto himself: Now, for this cause I know thatmanisnothing, which thing I never had supposed. 11But now mine own eyes havebeheldGod; but not mynatural, but myspiritualeyes, for mynaturaleyes could not havebeheld; for I should havewitheredanddiedin his presence; but hisglorywas upon me; and I beheld hisface, for I wastransfiguredbefore him. 12And it came to pass that when Moses had said these words, behold,Satancametemptinghim, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me. 13And it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said: Who art thou? For behold, I am asonof God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thyglory, that I should worship thee? 14For behold, I could not look upon God, except hisgloryshould come upon me, and I were transfigured before him. But Icanlook upon thee in the natural man. Is it not so, surely? 15Blessed be the name of my God, for hisSpirithath not altogether withdrawn from me, or else where is thy glory, for it is darkness unto me? And I can judge between thee and God; for God said unto me:WorshipGod, for him only shalt thouserve. 16Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not; for God said unto me: Thou art after thesimilitudeof mine Only Begotten. 17And he also gave me commandments when hecalledunto me out of the burningbush, saying:Callupon God in the name of mine Only Begotten, and worship me. 18And again Moses said: I will not cease to call upon God, I have otherthings to inquire of him: for hisgloryhas been upon me, wherefore I can judge between him and thee.Departhence, Satan. 19And now, when Moses had said these words,Satancried with a loud voice, and ranted upon the earth, and commanded, saying: I am theOnly Begotten, worship me. 20And it came to pass that Moses began tofearexceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness ofhell. Nevertheless,callingupon God, he receivedstrength, and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God ofglory. 21And now Satan began to tremble, and the earth shook; and Moses received strength, and called upon God, saying: In the name of the Only Begotten,departhence,Satan. 22And it came to pass that Satan cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and wailing, andgnashingof teeth; and he departed hence, even from the presence of Moses, that he beheld him not. 23And now of this thing Moses bore record; but because ofwickednessit isnothad among the children of men. 24And it came to pass that when Satan had departed from the presence of Moses, that Moses lifted up his eyes unto heaven, being filled with theHoly Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son; 25And calling upon the name of God, he beheld hisgloryagain, for it was upon him; and he heard avoice, saying: Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty, havechosenthee, and thou shalt be made stronger than manywaters; for they shall obey thycommandas if thou wertGod. 26And lo, I amwith thee, even unto the end of thy days; for thou shaltdelivermy people frombondage, evenIsraelmychosen. 27And it came to pass, as the voice was still speaking, Moses cast his eyes andbeheldthe earth, yea, even all of it; and there was not a particle of it which he did not behold,discerningit by theSpiritof God. 28And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not asoulwhich he beheld not; and he discerned them by the Spirit of God; and their numbers were great, even numberless as the sand upon the sea shore. 29And he beheld many lands; and each land was calledearth, and there wereinhabitantson the face thereof. 30And it came to pass that Moses called upon God, saying:Tellme, I pray thee, why these things are so, and by what thou madest them? 31And behold, the glory of the Lord was upon Moses, so that Moses stood in the presence of God, andtalked with himface to face. And the Lord God said unto Moses: For mine ownpurposehave I made these things. Here iswisdomand it remaineth in me. 32And by thewordof my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full ofgraceand truth. 33Andworldswithout number have Icreated; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by theSonIcreatedthem, which is mineOnly Begotten. 34And thefirstman of all men have I calledAdam, which ismany. 35But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and Iknowthem. 36And it came to pass that Moses spake unto the Lord, saying: Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, andtellme concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens, and then thy servant will be content. 37And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: Theheavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine. 38And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is noendto my works, neither to my words. 39For behold, this is myworkand mygloryâto bring to pass theimmortalityandeternallifeof man. 40And now, Moses, my son, I will speak unto thee concerning this earth upon which thou standest; and thou shaltwritethe things which I shall speak. 41And in a day when the children of men shall esteem my words asnaughtandtakemany of them from thebookwhich thou shalt write, behold, I will raise up anotherlikeunto thee; and they shall behadagain among the children of menâamong as many as shall believe. 42(These words werespokenunto Moses in the mount, the name of which shall not be known among the children of men. And now they are spoken unto you. Show them not unto any except them that believe. Even so. Amen.)"
