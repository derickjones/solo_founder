    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\nProverbs 1–4; 15–16; 22; 31; Ecclesiastes 1–3; 11–12\n\n“August 31–September 6. ‘Let Every Thing That Hath Breath Praise the Lord’”: Psalms 102–103; 110; 116–119; 127–128; 135–139; 146–150,”Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026(2026)\n\n“August 31–September 6. ‘Let Every Thing That Hath Breath Praise the Lord,’”Come, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\n\nAugust 31–September 6: “Let Every Thing That Hath Breath Praise the Lord”\n\nThe traditional Jewish name for the book of Psalms isTehillim, a Hebrew word that means “praises.” It’s related to the exclamationhallelujah(meaning “praise Jehovah” or “praise the Lord”). If you had to choose one word to sum up the main message of the Psalms,praisewould be a good choice. Some psalms contain the direct invitation to “praise ye the Lord” (see especiallyPsalms 146–50), and all of them can inspire worship and praise. The Psalms invite us to acknowledge the Lord’s power, His mercy, and the great things He has done. We can never repay Him for any of this, but we can praise Him. That praise might take different forms for different people—it might involve singing, praying, or bearing testimony. It often leads to a deeper commitment to the Lord and to following His teachings. Whatever “praise ye the Lord” means in your life, you can find inspiration to do it as you read and ponder the Psalms.",

and I love them exceedingly. 168I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all mywaysarebefore thee. 169Let my cry come near before thee, OLord: give meunderstandingaccording to thy word. 170Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word. 171My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes. 172My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandmentsarerighteousness. 173Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. 174I have longed for thy salvation, OLord; and thy lawismy delight. 175Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me. 176I have gone astray like a lostsheep;
