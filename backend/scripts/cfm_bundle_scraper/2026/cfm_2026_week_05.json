    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\nMost ofGenesis 5is a list of the generations between Adam and Eve and Noah. We read a lot of names, but we don’t learn much about them. Then we read this intriguing but unexplained line: “And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him” (Genesis 5:24). Surely there’s a story behind that verse! But without further explanation, the list of generations resumes.\n\nThankfully,Moses 6reveals the details of Enoch’s story—and it’s quite a story. We learn of Enoch’s humility, his insecurities, the potential God saw in him, and the great work he performed as God’s prophet. We also get a clearer picture of the family of Adam and Eve as it progressed through the generations. We read of Satan’s “great dominion” but also of parents who taught children “the ways of God” (Moses 6:15, 21). Especially precious is what we learn about the doctrine these parents taught: faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost (seeMoses 6:50–52). That doctrine, like the priesthood that accompanies it, “was in the beginning [and] shall be in the end of the world also” (Moses 6:7).",

And my fathertaughtme in all the ways of God. 42And it came to pass, as I journeyed from the land of Cainan, by the sea east, I beheld a vision; and lo, the heavens I saw, and the Lord spake with me, and gave me commandment; wherefore, for this cause, to keep the commandment, I speak forth these words. 43And Enoch continued his speech, saying: The Lord which spake with me, the same is the God of heaven, and he is my God, and your God, and ye are my brethren, and whycounselye yourselves, and deny the God of heaven? 44The heavens he made; theearthis hisfootstool; and the foundation thereof is his. Behold, he laid it, an host of men hath he brought in upon the face thereof. 45And death hath come upon our fathers; nevertheless we know them, and cannot deny, and even the first of all we know, evenAdam. 46For a book ofremembrancewe havewrittenamong us, according to the pattern given by the finger of God; and it is given in our ownlanguage. 47And as Enoch spake forth the words of God, the people trembled, and could notstandin his presence. 48And he said unto them: Because that Adamfell, we are; and by his fall camedeath; and we are made partakers of misery and woe. 49Behold Satan hath come among the children of men, andtempteththem toworshiphim; and men have becomecarnal,sensual, and devilish, and are shut out from thepresenceof God. 50But God hath made known unto our fathers that all men must repent. 51And he called upon our father Adam by his own voice, saying: I am God; Imadethe world, andmenbeforethey were in the flesh. 52And he also said unto him: If thou wilt turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice, and believe, and repent of all thy transgressions, and bebaptized, even in water, in the name of mine Only Begotten Son, who is full ofgraceand truth, which isJesus Christ, the onlynamewhich shall be given under heaven, wherebysalvationshall come unto the children of men, ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, asking all things in his name, and whatsoever ye shall ask, it shall be given you. 53And our father Adam spake untothe Lord, and said: Why is it that men must repent and be baptized in water? And the Lord said unto Adam: Behold I haveforgiventhee thy transgression in the Garden of Eden. 54Hence came the saying abroad among the people, that theSon of Godhathatonedfor original guilt, wherein the sins of the parents cannot be answered upon the heads of thechildren, for they arewholefrom the foundation of the world. 55And the Lord spake unto Adam, saying: Inasmuch as thy children areconceivedin sin, even so when they begin to grow up,sinconceiveth in their hearts, and they taste thebitter, that they may know to prize the good. 56And it is given unto them to know good from evil; wherefore they areagentsunto themselves, and I have given unto you another law and commandment. 57Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, mustrepent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for nounclean thingcan dwell there, ordwellin hispresence; for, in the language of Adam,Manof Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is theSon of Man, evenJesus Christ, a righteousJudge, who shall come in the meridian of time. 58Therefore I give unto you acommandment, toteachthese things freely unto yourchildren, saying: 59That by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death, and inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water, and blood, and thespirit, which I have made, and so became ofdusta living soul, even so ye must beborn againinto the kingdom of heaven, ofwater, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin, andenjoythewordsofeternal lifein this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortalglory; 60For by thewaterye keep the commandment; by the Spirit ye arejustified, and by thebloodye aresanctified; 61Therefore it is given to abide in you; therecordof heaven; theComforter; thepeaceablethings of immortal glory; the truth of all things; that which quickeneth all things, which maketh alive all things; that which knoweth all things, and hath allpoweraccordingto wisdom, mercy, truth, justice, and judgment. 62And now, behold, I say unto you: This is theplan of salvationunto all men, through thebloodof mineOnly Begotten, who shall come in the meridian of time. 63And behold, all things have theirlikeness, and all things are created and made tobear recordof me, both things which are temporal, and things which are spiritual; things which are in the heavens above, and things which are on the earth, and things which are in the earth, and things which are under the earth, both above and beneath: all things bear record of me. 64And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he wascaught awayby the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under thewater, and was brought forth out of the water. 65And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he wasbornof the Spirit, and became quickened in theinnerman. 66And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art baptized withfire, and with the Holy Ghost. This is therecordof the Father, and the Son, from henceforth and forever; 67And thou art after theorderof him who was without beginning of days or end of years, from all eternity to all eternity. 68Behold, thou artonein me, a son of God; and thus may all become mysons. Amen."
