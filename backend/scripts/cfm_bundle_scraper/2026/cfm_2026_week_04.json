    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\nAt first, the story of the Fall of Adam and Eve might seem like a tragedy. Adam and Eve were cast out of the beautiful Garden of Eden. They were sent into a world of pain, sorrow, and death (seeGenesis 3:16–19). And they were separated from their Heavenly Father. But the truths restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith in the book of Moses give us a unique perspective on the Fall.\n\nYes, the Garden of Eden was beautiful. But Adam and Eve needed more than beautiful surroundings. They needed—and we all need—an opportunity to grow. Leaving the Garden of Eden was the necessary first step toward returning to God and eventually becoming like Him. That meant facing opposition, making choices, making mistakes, learning to repent, and trusting the Savior, whose Atonement makes possible progression and “the joy of our redemption” (Moses 5:11). So when you read about the Fall of Adam and Eve, focus not on the seeming tragedy but on the possibilities—not on the paradise Adam and Eve lost but on the glory their choice allows us to receive.",

      "full_text": "1And it came to pass that after I, the Lord God, had driven them out, that Adam began to till the earth, and to havedominionover all the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread by the sweat of hisbrow, as I the Lord had commanded him. And Eve, also, his wife, didlaborwith him. 2AndAdamknew his wife, and she bare unto himsonsanddaughters, and they began tomultiplyand to replenish the earth. 3And from that time forth, the sons anddaughtersof Adam began to divide two and two in the land, and to till the land, and to tend flocks, and they also begat sons and daughters. 4And Adam and Eve, his wife,called uponthe name of the Lord, and they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden ofEden, speaking unto them, and they saw him not; for they were shut out from hispresence. 5And he gave unto them commandments, that they shouldworshipthe Lord their God, and should offer thefirstlingsof theirflocks, for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam wasobedientunto the commandments of the Lord. 6And after many days anangelof the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offersacrificesunto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me. 7And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is asimilitudeof thesacrificeof the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full ofgraceandtruth. 8Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in thenameof the Son, and thou shaltrepentandcallupon God in the name of the Son forevermore. 9And in that day theHoly Ghostfell upon Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the Son, saying: I am theOnly Begottenof the Father from the beginning, henceforth and forever, that as thou hastfallenthou mayest beredeemed,and all mankind, even as many as will. 10And in that day Adam blessed God and wasfilled, and began toprophesyconcerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of mytransgressionmyeyesare opened, and in this life I shall havejoy, and again in thefleshI shall see God. 11And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have hadseed, and never should haveknowngood and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient. 12And Adam andEveblessed the name of God, and they made all thingsknownunto their sons and their daughters. 13AndSatancame among them, saying: I am also a son of God; and he commanded them, saying:Believeit not; and they believed it not, and theylovedSatan more than God. And men began from that time forth to becarnal, sensual, and devilish. 14And the Lord God called upon men by theHoly Ghosteverywhere and commanded them that they should repent; 15And as many asbelievedin the Son, and repented of their sins, should besaved; and as many as believed not and repented not, should bedamned; and the words went forth out of the mouth of God in a firm decree; wherefore they must be fulfilled. 16And Adam and Eve, his wife, ceased not to call upon God. And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bareCain, and said: I have gotten a man from the Lord; wherefore he may not reject his words. But behold, Cainhearkenednot, saying: Who is the Lord that I shouldknowhim? 17And she again conceived and bare his brother Abel. And Abelhearkenedunto the voice of the Lord. AndAbelwas a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 18And CainlovedSatan more than God. And Satan commanded him, saying:Makean offering unto the Lord. 19And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of thefruitof the ground an offering unto the Lord. 20And Abel, he also brought of thefirstlingsof his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the Lord hadrespectunto Abel, and to hisoffering; 21But unto Cain, and to hisoffering, he had not respect. Now Satan knew this, and itpleasedhim. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 22And the Lord said unto Cain: Why art thou wroth? Why is thy countenance fallen? 23If thou doest well, thou shalt beaccepted. And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door, and Satandesirethto have thee; and exceptthou shalt hearken unto my commandments, I willdeliverthee up, and it shall be unto thee according to his desire. And thou shaltruleover him; 24For from this time forth thou shalt be the father of hislies; thou shalt be calledPerdition; for thou wast alsobeforethe world. 25And it shall be said in time to comeâThat these abominations were had fromCain; for he rejected the greater counsel which was had from God; and this is acursingwhich I will put upon thee, except thou repent. 26And Cain was wroth, and listened not any more to the voice of the Lord, neither to Abel, his brother, who walked in holiness before the Lord. 27And Adam and his wifemournedbefore the Lord, because of Cain and his brethren. 28And it came to pass that Cain took one of his brothersâ daughters towife, and theylovedSatan more than God. 29And Satan said unto Cain:Swearunto me by thy throat, and if thou tell it thou shalt die; and swear thy brethren by their heads, and by the living God, that they tell it not; for if they tell it, they shall surely die; and this that thy father may not know it; and this day I will deliver thy brother Abel into thine hands. 30And Satan sware unto Cain that he would do according to hiscommands. And all these things were done in secret. 31And Cain said: Truly I am Mahan, the master of this greatsecret, that I maymurderand getgain. Wherefore Cain was called MasterMahan, and he gloried in his wickedness. 32And Cain went into the field, and Cain talked with Abel, his brother. And it came to pass that while they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and slew him. 33And Caingloriedin that which he had done, saying: I am free; surely theflocksof my brother falleth into my hands. 34And the Lord said unto Cain: Where is Abel, thy brother? And he said: I know not. Am I my brotherâskeeper? 35And the Lord said: What hast thou done? The voice of thy brotherâsbloodcries unto me from the ground. 36And now thou shalt becursedfrom the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brotherâs blood from thy hand. 37When thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee herstrength. Afugitiveand a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. 38And Cain said unto the Lord: Satantemptedme because of my brotherâs flocks. And I was wroth also; for his offering thou didst accept and not mine; mypunishmentis greater than I can bear. 39Behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the Lord, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that he that findeth me will slay me, because of mine iniquities, for these things are not hid from the Lord. 40And I the Lord said unto him:Whosoever slayeth thee, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And I the Lord set amarkupon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. 41And Cain wasshut outfrom thepresenceof the Lord, and with his wife and many of his brethren dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 42And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bare Enoch, and he also begat many sons and daughters. And he builded a city, and he called the name of thecityafter the name of his son, Enoch. 43And unto Enoch was born Irad, and other sons and daughters. And Irad begat Mahujael, and other sons and daughters. And Mahujael begat Methusael, and other sons and daughters. And Methusael begat Lamech. 44And Lamech took unto himself two wives; the name of one being Adah, and the name of the other, Zillah. 45And Adah bare Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell intents, and they were keepers of cattle; and his brotherâs name was Jubal, who was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. 46And Zillah, she also bare Tubal Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal Cain was called Naamah. 47And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech; for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. 48If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech shall beseventy and seven fold; 49ForLamechhaving entered into a covenant with Satan, after the manner of Cain, wherein he became Master Mahan, master of that great secret which was administered unto Cain by Satan; and Irad, the son of Enoch, having known their secret, began to reveal it unto the sons of Adam; 50Wherefore Lamech, being angry, slew him, not like unto Cain, his brother Abel, for the sake of getting gain, but he slew him for theoathâssake. 51For, from the days of Cain, there was a secretcombination, and their works were in the dark, and they knew every man his brother. 52Wherefore the LordcursedLamech, and his house, and all them that had covenanted with Satan; for they kept not the commandments of God, and it displeased God, and he ministered not unto them, and their works were abominations, and began to spread among all thesonsof men. And it was among the sons of men. 53And among the daughters of men these things were not spoken, because that Lamech had spoken the secret unto his wives, and they rebelled against him, and declared these things abroad, and had not compassion; 54Wherefore Lamech was despised, and cast out, and came not among the sons of men, lest he should die. 55And thus the works ofdarknessbegan to prevail among all the sons of men. 56And Godcursedthe earth with a sore curse, and was angry with the wicked, with all the sons of men whom he had made; 57For they would nothearkenunto his voice, nor believe on his Only Begotten Son, even him whom he declared shouldcomein the meridian of time, who waspreparedfrom before the foundation of the world. 58And thus theGospelbegan to bepreached, from the beginning, being declared byholyangelssent forth from the presence of God, and by his own voice, and by the gift of the Holy Ghost. 59And thus all things were confirmed untoAdam, by an holy ordinance, and the Gospel preached, and a decree sent forth, that it should be in the world, until the end thereof; and thus it was. Amen."
