    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\n“November 16–22. ‘I Will Love Them Freely’: Hosea 1–6; 10–14; Joel,”Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026(2026)\n\n“November 16–22. ‘I Will Love Them Freely,’”Come, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\n\nIsrael’s covenant with the Lord was meant to be so deep and meaningful that the Lord compared it to a marriage. The covenant, like a marriage, included eternal commitment, shared experiences, building a life together, exclusive loyalty, and, most of all, wholehearted love. Sadly, the Israelites were not faithful to their covenant. And yet the Lord’s message to them was not “I will reject you forever.” Instead it was “I will invite you back” (seeHosea 2:14–15). “I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness,” He declared through the prophet Hosea (Hosea 2:19). “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely” (Hosea 14:4). This is the same message He gives us today as we seek to live our covenants with love and devotion.\n\nJoel shared a similar message: “Turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness” (Joel 2:13). Reading these prophets’ words may prompt you to ponder your own relationship with the Lord—to think about how His faithfulness to you inspires you to be faithful to Him.\n\nFor an overview of the books of Hosea and Joel, see “Hosea, or Hoshea” and “Joel” in the Bible Dictionary.",
