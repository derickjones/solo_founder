    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\n“September 28–October 4. ‘Comfort Ye My People’: Isaiah 40–49,”Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026(2026)\n\n“September 28–October 4. ‘Comfort Ye My People,’”Come, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\n\nHealing the Blind Man, by Carl Heinrich Bloch, at the Frederiksborg Museum of National History\n\n“Comfort” is the first word ofIsaiah chapter 40. It marks the beginning of a different tone, a different emphasis in the prophet’s message. Isaiah’s earlier writings warned Israel and Judah about destruction and captivity that would come because of their sins. But these later prophecies were meant to comfort the Jewish people over 150 years in the future—after Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed and the people were taken captive by Babylon. These prophecies, however, reach even further into the future than to the defeated, disheartened Israelites. They speak to us, who also sometimes feel defeated, disheartened, and even lost.\n\nIsaiah’s message to his people and to us is simple: “Fear not” (Isaiah 43:1). All is not lost. The Lord has not forgotten you, and He has power over situations that seem out of your control. Isn’t the Lord, who “created the heavens” (Isaiah 42:5), more powerful than Babylon, than sin, than whatever is holding you captive? “Return unto me,” He pleads, “for I have redeemed thee” (Isaiah 44:22). He can heal, restore, strengthen, forgive, and comfort—whatever is needed for you, in your case, to be redeemed.",

Consider singing or listening to this hymn, looking for parallels between the lyrics and these verses from Isaiah. How has the Lord fulfilled the promises in these verses in your life?\n\nSee also Patrick Kearon, “He Is Risen with Healing in His Wings: We Can Be More Than Conquerors,”Liahona, May 2022, 37–40.\n\nUse additional scripture.Sometimes we can understand the Old Testament better if we supplement our study with verses from the Book of Mormon. For example, the Book of Mormon prophets Nephi and Jacob had access to the writings of Isaiah on the plates of brass (see1 Nephi 19:22–23), and they used these prophecies to teach about the Savior. To learn how Nephi and Jacob likenedIsaiah 48–49to their people, see1 Nephi 22. That may help you liken these chapters to your own life.\n\nBy obeying the Lord, we can have “peace … as a river” (Isaiah 48:18).\n\nIsaiah 40–49"

You might also consider how the passages apply to you as a servant and a witness of the Lord. For example, ponder questions like these:\n\nIsaiah 40:1–3, 9–11;43:9–12.In what sense are you a witness of Jesus Christ? What are the “good tidings” that you can share as His witness? You might imagine that you have been called to the witness stand in a court trial. In this trial, Jesus Christ has been charged with making the claim recorded inIsaiah 43:11.

I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense. 24Thou hast bought me nosweet canewith money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hastmademe to serve with thy sins, thou hastweariedme with thine iniquities. 25I,evenI,amhe thatblottethout thytransgressionsfor mine ownsake, and will not remember thy sins. 26Put me in remembrance: let us plead together:declarethou, that thou mayest be justified. 27Thyfirst fatherhath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me. 28Therefore I haveprofanedtheprincesof the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches."
