Image courtesy of havenlight.com\n\nWe don’t know for certain who wrote the Psalms. Some are attributed to King David, but for most of them, the writers remain anonymous. Yet after reading the Psalms, we feel as if we know the hearts of the psalmists, even if we don’t know their names. We do know that the Psalms were an important part of worship among the Israelites, and we know that the Savior quoted them often. In the Psalms, we get a window into the soul of God’s ancient people. We see how they felt about God, what they worried about, and how they found peace. As believers today, all over the world, we still use these words in our worship of God. It’s almost like the writers of the Psalms had a window intooursouls, because they expressed how we feel about God, what we worry about, and how we find peace.\n\nFor an overview of the book of Psalms, see “Psalms” in the Bible Dictionary.",
