Millions today honor him as their direct ancestor, and others have been adopted into his family through conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Yet Abraham himself came from a troubled family—his father, who had abandoned the true worship of God, tried to have Abraham sacrificed to false gods. In spite of this, Abraham’s desire was “to be a greater follower of righteousness” (Abraham 1:2), and the account of his life shows that God honored his desire. Abraham’s life stands as a testimony that no matter what a person’s family history has been, the future can be filled with hope.",

        "title": "God wants me to make and keep covenants with Him.",
        "content": "Why is it important for you to know about the covenant God made with Abraham? Because God wants to make a similar covenant with you. He promised that this covenant would continue in Abraham’s posterity, or “seed,” and that “as many as receive this Gospel shall be … accounted thy seed” (seeAbraham 2:10–11). In other words, the covenant continues in you—when you are baptized and more completely when you make covenants in the temple (seeGalatians 3:26–29;Doctrine and Covenants 132:30–32).\n\nFor that reason, you might want to studyAbraham 2:6–11and make a list of what, exactly, God promised Abraham and Sarah (see alsoGenesis 12:1–3;13:15–16;15:1–6;17:1–8, 15–22). How might these blessings apply to you?\n\nSome of these promises have eternal parallels. How are promises like a land of inheritance or a large posterity fulfilled eternally? (seeDoctrine and Covenants 131:1–4;132:20–24, 28–32).\n\nBesides promising blessings, God told Abraham to “bea blessing” (Genesis 12:2; emphasis added). What do you think that means? How willyoube a blessing? (seeAbraham 2:11).\n\nTo teach about covenants, Elder Dale G. Renlund spoke of tidal waves in the Amazon River, and President Emily Belle Freeman talked about walking a rocky path with a broken ankle (see “Accessing God’s Power through Covenants,”Liahona, May 2023, 35–37; “Walking in Covenant Relationship with Christ,”Liahona, Nov. 2023, 76–79). Search one or both of these messages for sentences that help answer the question “Why does God want me to make covenants with Him?”\n\nInvite people to teach each other.If you’re teaching your family or a Church class about covenants, consider giving each person a portion of Elder Renlund’s or President Freeman’s message to study. Then they could share with the rest of the family or class what they learned. This allows people to testify to and learn from each other, and that invites the Spirit.
