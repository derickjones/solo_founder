    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\n“March 9–15. ‘The Lord Was with Joseph’: Genesis 37–41,”Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026(2026)\n\n“March 9–15. ‘The Lord Was with Joseph’,”Come, Follow Me: 2026\n\nWe know that God blesses people who trust Him and keep His commandments. But sometimes it doesn’t seem that way. Sometimes the person who trusts God is abused and abandoned by family members. Sometimes the person who bravely refuses to violate the law of chastity gets falsely accused anyway. When things like that happen to us, we might be tempted to become angry with God. We might wonder, “What’s the point of trying to do the right thing if it only seems to make life harder?”\n\nJoseph, the son of Jacob, could have wondered that. At times, this faithful man prospered; at other times, it seemed that the more faithful he was, the more hardship he faced. But Joseph never left the Lord, and the Lord never left Joseph. That doesn’t mean the Lord prevented bad things from happening to Joseph, but through it all, “the Lord was with him” (Genesis 39:3).",

And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 18And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, theyconspiredagainst him to slay him. 19And they said one to another, Behold, thisdreamercometh. 20Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. 21AndReubenheardit,and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. 22And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood,butcast him into this pit thatisin the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. 23Â¶And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of hiscoat,hiscoat ofmanycolours thatwason him; 24And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pitwasempty,there wasno water in it. 25And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carryitdown to Egypt. 26And Judah said unto his brethren, What profitis itif we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? 27Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for heisour brotherandour flesh. And his brethrenwere content. 28Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to theIshmeelitesfor twentypiecesof silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. 29Â¶And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Josephwasnot in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 30And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The childisnot; and I, whither shall I go? 31And they took Josephâs coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 32And they sent the coat ofmanycolours, and they broughtitto their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether itbethy sonâs coat or no. 33And he knew it, and said,It ismy sonâscoat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubtrentin pieces. 34And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 35And all hissonsand all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to becomforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my sonmourning. Thus his father wept for him. 36And the Midianitessoldhim into Egypt untoPotiphar, anofficerof Pharaohâs,andcaptain of the guard."

So Pharaoh awoke. 5And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. 6And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 7And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold,it wasa dream. 8And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit wastroubled; and he sent and called for all themagiciansof Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; butthere wasnone that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. 9Â¶Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 10Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guardâs house,bothme and the chief baker: 11And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 12Andthere wasthere with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. 13And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. 14Â¶ThenPharaohsent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of thedungeon: and he shavedhimself,and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 15And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, andthere isnone that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee,thatthou canst understand a dream tointerpretit. 16And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying,It isnot in me:Godshall give Pharaoh an answer ofpeace. 17And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 18And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 19And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and veryill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 20And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 21And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but theywerestill ill favoured, as at the beginning.

And Joseph went out overallthe land of Egypt. 46Â¶AndJosephwasthirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 47And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 48And he gathered up all thefoodof the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, whichwasround about every city, laid he up in the same. 49And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; forit waswithout number. 50And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him. 51And Joseph called the name of the firstbornManasseh: For God,said he,hath made me forget all my toil, and all my fatherâs house. 52And the name of the second called heEphraim: For God hath caused me to befruitfulin the land of my affliction. 53Â¶And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. 54And the seven years ofdearthbegan to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 55And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 56And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, andsoldunto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 57And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buycorn;because that the famine wassosore in all lands."
