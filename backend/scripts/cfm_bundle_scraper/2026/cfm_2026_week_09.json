    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\n“February 23–March 1. ‘Is Any Thing Too Hard for the Lord?’: Genesis 18–23,”Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026(2026)\n\n“February 23–March 1. ‘Is Any Thing Too Hard for the Lord?’,”Come, Follow Me: 2026\n\nFebruary 23–March 1: “Is Any Thing Too Hard for the Lord?”\n\nAbraham and Sarah’s life, filled with events both heartbreaking and heartwarming, is evidence of a truth Abraham learned in a vision—that we are on earth to be proven, “to see if [we] will do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command” (Abraham 3:25). Would Abraham and Sarah prove faithful? Would they continue to have faith in God’s promise of a large posterity, even when they were still childless in their old age? And once Isaac was born, would their faith endure the unthinkable—a command to sacrifice the very son through whom God had promised to fulfill that covenant?\n\nAbraham and Sarah trusted God, and He trusted them (seeGenesis 15:6;Romans 4:3). InGenesis 18–23, we find stories from the lives of Abraham, Sarah, and others that can prompt us to think about our own willingness to believe God’s promises, to flee wickedness and never look back, and to trust God regardless of the sacrifice. In proving us, God also improves us.",

How did Abraham and Sarah react? (seeJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 17:23[inGenesis 17:17, footnoteb];Genesis 18:9–12). How did the Lord respond to help them have greater faith in His promises?

It would appear that even before she was past the city limits, she was already missing what Sodom and Gomorrah had offered her. …\n\n“It is possible that Lot’s wife looked back with resentment toward the Lord for what He was asking her to leave behind. … So it isn’t just that she looked back; she looked backlongingly.In short, her attachment to the past outweighed her confidence in the future. That, apparently, was at least part of her sin.\n\n“… I plead with you not to dwell on days now gone nor to yearn vainly for yesterdays, however good those yesterdays may have been. The past is to be learned from but not lived in. We look back to claim the embers from glowing experiences but not the ashes. And when we have learned what we need to learn and have brought with us the best that we have experienced, then we look ahead and remember thatfaith is always pointed toward the future. …\n\n“… Dwelling on past lives, including past mistakes, is just not right! It is not the gospel of Jesus Christ. …\n\n“To all [people] of every generation, I call out, ‘Remember Lot’s wife’ [Luke 17:32]. Faith is for the future. Faith builds on the past but never longs to stay there.

And they said, So do, as thou hast said. 6And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, kneadit,and make cakes upon the hearth. 7And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gaveitunto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. 8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and setitbefore them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. 9Â¶And they said unto him, WhereisSarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. 10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo,Sarahthy wife shall have ason. And Sarah hearditin the tent door, whichwasbehind him. 11Now Abraham and Sarahwereoldandwell stricken in age;anditceasedto be with Sarah after the manner of women. 12Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord beingoldalso? 13And theLordsaid unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarahlaugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which amold? 14Is any thing toohardfor theLord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to thetimeof life, and Sarah shall have a son. 15Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. 16Â¶And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 17And theLordsaid, Shall Ihidefrom Abraham that thing which I do; 18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mightynation, and all thenationsof the earth shall beblessedin him? 19For Iknowhim, that he willcommandhischildrenand hishouseholdafter him, and they shallkeepthe way of theLord, to do justice andjudgment; that theLordmay bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. 20And theLordsaid, Because thecryof Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because theirsinis very grievous; 21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I willknow. 22Andthe men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abrahamstoodyet before theLord. 23Â¶And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou alsodestroytherighteouswith thewicked? 24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and notsparethe place for the fifty righteous thataretherein? 25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not theJudgeof all the earth do right? 26And theLordsaid, If I find in Sodom fiftyrighteouswithin the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. 27And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, whicham butdustand ashes: 28Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city forlack offive? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroyit. 29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not doitfor fortyâs sake. 30And he saidunto him,Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not doit,if I find thirty there. 31And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroyitfor twentyâs sake. 32And he said, Oh let not the Lord beangry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall befound there. And he said, I willnotdestroyitfor tenâs sake. 33And theLordwenthis way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place."

And she sat over againsthim,and lift up her voice, and wept. 17And God heard the voice of the lad; and theangelof God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where heis. 18Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a greatnation. 19And Godopenedher eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 20And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became anarcher. 21And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him awifeout of the land ofEgypt. 22Â¶And it came to pass at that time, thatAbimelechandPhicholthe chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying,Godiswith thee in all that thou doest: 23Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my sonâs son:butaccording to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. 24And Abraham said, I will swear. 25And AbrahamreprovedAbimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelechâs servantshadviolently taken away. 26And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard Iof it,but to day. 27And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of themmadea covenant. 28And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 29And Abimelech said unto Abraham, Whatmeanthese seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 30And he said, Fortheseseven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged thiswell. 31Wherefore he called that placeBeer-sheba; because there they sware both of them. 32Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba:thenAbimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 33Â¶AndAbrahamplanted agrovein Beer-sheba, andcalledthere on the name of theLord, theeverlastingGod. 34And Abraham sojourned in thePhilistinesâland many days."
