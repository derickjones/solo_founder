    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\n“March 23–29. ‘I Have Remembered My Covenant’: Exodus 1–6,”Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026(2026)\n\n“March 23–29. ‘I Have Remembered My Covenant’,”Come, Follow Me: 2026\n\nThe invitation to live in Egypt saved Jacob’s family. But after hundreds of years, their descendants were enslaved and terrorized by a new pharaoh who “knew not Joseph” (Exodus 1:8). It would have been natural for the Israelites to wonder why God allowed this to happen to them, His covenant people. Did He remember the covenant He had made with them? Were they still His people? Could He see how much they were suffering?\n\nThere may be times when you’ve felt like asking similar questions. You might wonder, “Does God know what I’m going through? Can He hear my pleas for help?” Israel’s deliverance from Egypt answers such questions clearly: God does not forget His people. He remembers His covenants with us and will fulfill them in His own time and way. “I will redeem you with a stretched out arm,” He declares. “I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under [your] burdens” (Exodus 6:6–7).\n\nFor an overview of the book of Exodus, see “Exodus, book of” in the Bible Dictionary.",

And she had compassion on him, and said, Thisis oneof the Hebrewsâ children. 7Then said his sister to Pharaohâs daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 8And Pharaohâs daughter said to her, Go.

Iknow nottheLord, neither will I let Israel go. 3And they said, TheGodof the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three daysâ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto theLordour God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. 4And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron,letthe people from their works? get you unto yourburdens. 5And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land nowaremany, and ye make them rest from their burdens. 6And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 7Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 8And thetaleof the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminishoughtthereof: for theybeidle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us goandsacrifice to our God. 9Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. 10Â¶And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 11Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yetnot ought ofyour work shall be diminished. 12So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. 13And the taskmastershastedthem,saying, Fulfil your works,yourdaily tasks, as when there was straw. 14And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaohâs taskmasters had set over them, were beaten,anddemanded, Whereforehave ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? 15Â¶Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? 16There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servantsarebeaten; but the faultisin thine own people. 17But he said, Yeareidle,ye areidle: therefore ye say, Let us goanddo sacrifice to theLord. 18Go therefore now,andwork; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 19And the officers of the children of Israel did seethattheywerein evilcase,after it was said, Ye shall not minishoughtfrom your bricks of your daily task. 20Â¶And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 21And they said unto them, TheLordlook upon you, and judge; because ye have madeoursavour to beabhorredin the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. 22And Mosesreturnedunto theLord, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thousoevil entreatedthis people? whyisitthatthou hast sent me? 23For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all."
