As God’s people, we share this desire. We call it building Zion, and it includes—in addition to caring for people in need and promoting peace—making covenants, dwelling together in righteousness, and becoming one with each other and with Jesus Christ, “the King of Zion” (Moses 7:53). If the world, your community, or your family isn’t quite what you want it to be, it’s helpful to ask, How did Enoch and his people do it? How did they become “of one heart and one mind” (Moses 7:18) despite the contention around them? Among the many detailsMoses 7gives us about Zion, a particularly valuable one for Latter-day Saints might be this: Zion is not just a city—it is a condition of the heart and spirit. Zion, as the Lord has taught, is “the pure in heart” (Doctrine and Covenants 97:21). So perhaps the best way to build Zion is to start in our own hearts and homes.",

      "full_text": "1And it came to pass that Enoch continued his speech, saying: Behold, our father Adam taught these things, and many have believed and become thesonsof God, and many have believed not, and have perished in their sins, and are looking forth withfear, in torment, for the fiery indignation of the wrath of God to be poured out upon them. 2And from that time forth Enoch began to prophesy, saying unto the people, that: As I was journeying, and stood upon the place Mahujah, and cried unto the Lord, there came a voice out of heaven, sayingâTurn ye, and get ye upon the mountSimeon. 3And it came to pass that I turned and went up on the mount; and as I stood upon the mount, I beheld the heavens open, and I was clothed upon withglory; 4And Isawthe Lord; and he stood before my face, and he talked with me, even as a man talketh one with another,face to face; and hesaid unto me:Look, and I willshowunto thee the world for the space of many generations. 5And it came to pass that I beheld in the valley of Shum, and lo, a great people which dwelt intents, which were the people of Shum. 6And again the Lord said unto me: Look; and I looked towards the north, and I beheld the people ofCanaan, which dwelt in tents. 7And the Lord said unto me: Prophesy; and I prophesied, saying: Behold the people of Canaan, which are numerous, shall go forth in battle array against the people of Shum, and shall slay them that they shall utterly be destroyed; and the people of Canaan shall divide themselves in the land, and the land shall be barren and unfruitful, and none other people shall dwell there but the people of Canaan; 8For behold, the Lord shallcursethe land with much heat, and thebarrennessthereof shall go forth forever; and there was ablacknesscame upon all the children of Canaan, that they were despised among all people. 9And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Look; and I looked, and I beheld the land of Sharon, and the land of Enoch, and the land of Omner, and the land of Heni, and the land of Shem, and the land of Haner, and the land of Hanannihah, and all the inhabitants thereof; 10And the Lord said unto me: Go to this people, and say unto themâRepent, lest I come out and smite them with a curse, and they die. 11And he gave unto me a commandment that I shouldbaptizein the name of the Father, and of the Son, which is full ofgraceand truth, and of the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son. 12And it came to pass that Enoch continued to call upon all the people, save it were the people of Canaan, to repent; 13And so great was thefaithof Enoch that he led the people of God, and their enemies came to battle against them; and hespakethe word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and themountainsfled, even according to his command; and theriversof water were turned out of their course; and the roar of the lions was heard out of the wilderness; and all nations feared greatly, sopowerfulwas the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him. 14There also cameupa land out of the depth of the sea, and so great was the fear of the enemies of the people of God, that they fled and stood afar off and went upon the land which came up out of the depth of the sea. 15And thegiantsof the land, also, stood afar off; and there went forth acurseupon all people that fought against God; 16And from that time forth there were wars and bloodshed among them; but the Lord came anddweltwith his people, and they dwelt in righteousness. 17Thefearof the Lord was upon all nations, so great was thegloryof the Lord, which was upon his people. And the Lord blessed theland, and they were blessed upon the mountains, and upon the high places, and did flourish. 18And the Lord called his peopleZion, because they were ofoneheart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them. 19And Enoch continued his preaching in righteousness unto the people of God. And it came to pass in his days, that he built a city that was called the City of Holiness, evenZion. 20And it came to pass that Enoch talked with the Lord; and he said unto the Lord: SurelyZionshall dwell in safety forever. But the Lord said unto Enoch: Zion have I blessed, but theresidueof the people have I cursed. 21And it came to pass that the Lord showed unto Enoch all the inhabitants of the earth; and he beheld, and lo,Zion, in process of time, wastakenup into heaven. And the Lord said unto Enoch: Behold mine abode forever. 22And Enoch also beheld the residue of the people which were the sons of Adam; and they were a mixture of all the seed of Adam save it was the seed of Cain, for the seed of Cain wereblack, and had not place among them. 23And after that Zion was taken up intoheaven, Enochbeheld, and lo,allthe nations of the earth were before him; 24And there came generation upon generation; and Enoch was high andlifted up, even in the bosom of the Father, and of the Son of Man; and behold, the power of Satan was upon all the face of the earth. 25And he saw angels descending out of heaven; and he heard a loud voice saying: Wo, wo be unto the inhabitants of the earth. 26And he beheld Satan; and he had a greatchainin his hand, and it veiled the whole face of the earth withdarkness; and he looked up andlaughed, and hisangelsrejoiced. 27And Enoch beheldangelsdescending out of heaven, bearingtestimonyof the Father and Son; and the Holy Ghost fell on many, and they were caught up by the powers of heaven into Zion. 28And it came to pass that the God of heaven looked upon theresidueof the people, and he wept; and Enoch bore record of it, saying: How is it that the heavens weep, and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains? 29And Enoch said unto the Lord: How is it that thou canstweep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity? 30And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions ofearthslike this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thycreations; and thy curtains are stretched out still; and yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; and also thou art just; thou art merciful and kind forever; 31And thou hast takenZionto thine own bosom, from all thy creations, from all eternity to all eternity; and naught but peace,justice, and truth is the habitation of thy throne; and mercy shall go before thy face and have no end; how is it thou canstweep? 32The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine ownhands, and I gave unto them theirknowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man hisagency; 33And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they shouldloveone another, and that they should choose me, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and theyhatetheir own blood; 34And thefireof mineindignationis kindled against them; and in my hot displeasure will I send in thefloodsupon them, for my fierce anger is kindled against them. 35Behold, I am God;Manof Holiness is my name; Man of Counsel is my name; and Endless and Eternal is myname, also. 36Wherefore, I can stretch forth mine hands and hold all thecreationswhich I have made; and mine eye can pierce them also, and among all the workmanship of mine hands there has not been so greatwickednessas among thy brethren. 37But behold, their sins shall be upon the heads of their fathers; Satan shall be their father, and misery shall be their doom; and the whole heavens shall weep over them, even all the workmanship of mine hands; wherefore should not the heavens weep, seeing these shall suffer? 38But behold, these which thine eyes are upon shall perish in the floods; and behold, I will shut them up; aprisonhave I prepared for them. 39Andthatwhich I have chosen hath pled before my face. Wherefore, hesufferethfor their sins; inasmuch as they will repent in the day that myChosenshall return unto me, and until that day they shall be intorment; 40Wherefore, for this shall the heavens weep, yea, and all the workmanship of mine hands. 41And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Enoch, andtoldEnoch all the doings of the children of men; wherefore Enoch knew, and looked upon their wickedness, and their misery, and wept and stretched forth his arms, and hisheartswelled wide as eternity; and his bowels yearned; and all eternity shook. 42And Enoch also saw Noah, and hisfamily; that the posterity of all the sons of Noah should be saved with a temporal salvation; 43Wherefore Enoch saw that Noah built anark; and that the Lord smiled upon it, and held it in his own hand; but upon the residue of the wicked thefloodscame and swallowed them up. 44And as Enoch saw this, he hadbitternessof soul, and wept over his brethren, and said unto the heavens: I will refuse to becomforted; but the Lord said unto Enoch: Lift up your heart, and be glad; and look. 45And it came to pass that Enoch looked; and from Noah, he beheld all the families of the earth; and he cried unto the Lord, saying: When shall the day of the Lord come? When shall the blood of the Righteous beshed, that all they that mourn may besanctifiedand have eternal life? 46And the Lord said: It shall be in themeridian of time, in the days of wickedness and vengeance. 47And behold, Enochsawthe day of the coming of the Son of Man, even in the flesh; and his soul rejoiced, saying: The Righteous is lifted up, and theLambis slain from the foundation of the world; and throughfaithI am in the bosom of the Father, and behold,Zionis with me. 48And it came to pass that Enoch looked upon theearth; and he heard a voice from the bowels thereof, saying: Wo, wo is me, the mother of men; I ampained, I am weary, because of the wickedness of my children. When shall Irest, and becleansedfrom thefilthinesswhich is gone forth out of me? When will my Creator sanctify me, that I may rest, and righteousness for a season abide upon my face? 49And when Enoch heard the earth mourn, he wept, and cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, wilt thou not have compassion upon the earth? Wilt thou not bless the children of Noah? 50And it came to pass that Enoch continued his cry unto the Lord, saying: I ask thee, O Lord, in the name of thine Only Begotten, even Jesus Christ, that thou wilt have mercy upon Noah and his seed, that the earth might never more be covered by thefloods. 51And the Lord could not withhold; and hecovenantedwith Enoch, and sware unto him with an oath, that he would stay thefloods; that he would call upon the children of Noah; 52And he sent forth an unalterable decree, that aremnantof his seed should always be found among all nations, while the earth should stand; 53And the Lord said: Blessed is he through whose seed Messiah shall come; for he saithâI amMessiah, theKingof Zion, theRockof Heaven, which is broad aseternity; whoso cometh in at the gate andclimbethup by me shall never fall; wherefore, blessed are they of whom I have spoken, for they shall come forth withsongsof everlastingjoy. 54And it came to pass that Enoch cried unto the Lord, saying: When the Son of Man cometh in the flesh, shall the earth rest? I pray thee, show me these things. 55And the Lord said unto Enoch: Look, and he looked and beheld theSon of Manlifted up on thecross, after the manner of men; 56And he heard a loud voice; and the heavens wereveiled; and all the creations of God mourned; and the earthgroaned; and the rocks were rent; and thesaintsarose, and werecrownedat theright handof the Son of Man, with crowns of glory; 57And as many of thespiritsas were inprisoncame forth, and stood on the right hand of God; andthe remainder were reserved in chains of darkness until the judgment of the great day. 58And again Enoch wept and cried unto the Lord, saying: When shall the earthrest? 59And Enoch beheld the Son of Man ascend up unto the Father; and he called unto the Lord, saying: Wilt thou not come again upon the earth? Forasmuch as thou art God, and I know thee, and thou hast sworn unto me, and commanded me that I should ask in the name of thine Only Begotten; thou hast made me, and given unto me a right to thy throne, and not of myself, but through thine own grace; wherefore, I ask thee if thou wilt not come again on the earth. 60And the Lord said unto Enoch: As I live, even so will I come in thelast days, in the days of wickedness and vengeance, to fulfil theoathwhich I have made unto you concerning the children of Noah; 61And the day shall come that the earth shallrest, but before that day the heavens shall bedarkened, and aveilof darkness shall cover the earth; and the heavens shall shake, and also the earth; and great tribulations shall be among the children of men, but my people will Ipreserve; 62Andrighteousnesswill I send down out of heaven; and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to beartestimonyof mine Only Begotten; hisresurrectionfrom the dead; yea, and also the resurrection of all men; and righteousness and truth will I cause to sweep the earth as with a flood, togatherout mine elect from the four quarters of the earth, unto a place which I shall prepare, an Holy City, that my people may gird up their loins, and be looking forth for the time of my coming; for there shall be my tabernacle, and it shall be calledZion, aNew Jerusalem. 63And the Lord said unto Enoch: Then shalt thou and all thycitymeet them there, and we willreceivethem into our bosom, and they shall see us; and we will fall upon their necks, and they shall fall upon our necks, and we will kiss each other; 64And there shall be mine abode, and it shall be Zion, which shall come forth out of all the creations which I have made; and for the space of athousandyears theearthshallrest. 65And it came to pass that Enoch saw thedayof thecomingof the Son of Man, in the last days, to dwell on the earth in righteousness for the space of a thousand years; 66But before that day he saw great tribulations among the wicked; and he also saw the sea, that it was troubled, and menâs heartsfailingthem, looking forth with fear for thejudgmentsof the Almighty God, which should come upon the wicked. 67And the Lord showed Enoch all things, even unto the end of the world; and he saw the day of the righteous, the hour of their redemption, and received a fulness ofjoy; 68And all the days ofZion, in the days of Enoch, were three hundred and sixty-five years. 69And Enoch and all his peoplewalkedwith God, and he dwelt in the midst of Zion; and it came topass that Zion was not, for God received it up into his own bosom; and from thence went forth the saying,Zion is Fled."
