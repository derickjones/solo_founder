But in their way stood the Jordan River, the walls of Jericho, and a mighty people who had rejected the Lord (see1 Nephi 17:35). And they would have to face all of that without their beloved leader Moses. The situation may have made some Israelites feel weak and fearful, but the Lord said, “Be strong and of a good courage.” What reason did they have to be courageous? It wasn’t because of their own strength—or even Moses’s or Joshua’s—but because “the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest” (Joshua 1:9). When we have our own rivers to cross and walls to bring down, wonderful things can happen in our lives because “the Lord will do wonders among [us]” (Joshua 3:5).\n\nFor an overview of the book of Joshua, see “Joshua, book of” in the Bible Dictionary.",

See, I have commanded you. 9Â¶Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people. 10And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. 11And all the people,even the peopleof war thatwerewith him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, andpitchedon the north side of Ai: nowthere wasa valley between them and Ai. 12And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city. 13And when they had set the people,evenall the host thatwason the north of the city, andtheir liers in waiton the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. 14Â¶And it came to pass, when the king of Ai sawit,that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but hewistnot thatthere wereliers in ambush against him behind the city. 15And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 16And all the people thatwerein Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. 17And there was not a man left in Ai orBeth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. 18And theLordsaid unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear thatisin thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear thathe hadin his hand toward the city. 19And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire. 20And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. 21And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai. 22And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. 23And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. 24And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 25Andsoit was,thatall that fell that day, both of men and women,weretwelve thousand,evenall the men of Ai. 26For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 27Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took fora preyunto themselves, according unto the word of theLordwhich he commanded Joshua. 28And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever,evena desolation unto this day. 29And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones,that remainethunto this day. 30Â¶Then Joshua built an altar unto theLordGod of Israel in mount Ebal, 31As Moses the servant of theLordcommanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, analtarof wholestones, over which no man hath lift upanyiron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto theLord, and sacrificed peace offerings. 32Â¶And hewrotethere upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. 33And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of theLord, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mountGerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of theLordhad commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel. 34And afterward hereadall the words of the law, the blessings andcursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law. 35There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all thecongregationof Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers thatwere conversantamong them."
