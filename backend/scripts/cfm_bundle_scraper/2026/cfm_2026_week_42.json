    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\n“October 12–18. ‘The Redeemer Shall Come to Zion’: Isaiah 58–66,”Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026(2026)\n\n“October 12–18. ‘The Redeemer Shall Come to Zion,’”Come, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\n\nEarly in His ministry, Jesus Christ visited a synagogue in Nazareth, where He was raised. He stood there to read from the scriptures, opened the book of Isaiah, and read what we now know asIsaiah 61:1–2. He then announced, “This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.” This was one of the Savior’s most straightforward declarations that He was the Anointed One, who would “heal the brokenhearted” and “preach deliverance to the captives” (seeLuke 4:16–21). This scripture was indeed fulfilled on that day. And, like many other prophecies of Isaiah, it is also being fulfilled in our day. The Savior continues to heal the brokenhearted who come unto Him. There are still many captives who need deliverance. And there is a glorious future to prepare for—a time when the Lord will “create new heavens and a new earth” (Isaiah 65:17) and “cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations” (Isaiah 61:11). Reading Isaiah opens our eyes to what the Lord has already done, what He is doing, and what He will yet do for His people.",
