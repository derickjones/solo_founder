What does that mean? In part, it means that the Savior’s life influences the eternal destiny of everyone who has ever lived or ever will live. You might also say that the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, on that first Easter Sunday, connects all of God’s people throughout history: those who were born before His Resurrection looked forward to it with faith (seeJacob 4:4), and those born after look back on it with faith. As we read Old Testament accounts and prophecies, we don’t ever see the name Jesus Christ, but we do see the evidence of the ancient believers’ faith in and longing for their Messiah and Redeemer. So we who are invited torememberHim can feel a connection with those wholooked forwardto Him. For truly Jesus Christ has borne “the iniquity of usall” (Isaiah 53:6; emphasis added), and “in Christ shallallbe made alive” (1 Corinthians 15:22; emphasis added).",

And yet, even during Easter, there are many people who don’t feel joyful for various reasons.

You might also decide to share your messages on social media, where many people can see them.\n\nHymns about Christ and the Resurrection, such as “He Is Risen!” (Hymns, no. 199), can also help us feel peace and joy at Easter.
