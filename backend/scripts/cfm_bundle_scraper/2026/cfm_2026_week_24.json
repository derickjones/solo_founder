Though tall and handsome, he was “little in [his] own sight” and self-conscious about his family heritage (see1 Samuel 9:2–3, 21;15:17). On the day he was to be presented before Israel as their king, he didn’t show up; he was so nervous he “hid himself” (1 Samuel 10:21–22). Looking at Saul, you might not have guessed that he would lead the Israelites to victory over their enemies—or that he would later become prideful and rebel against the Lord.\n\nDavid was a keeper of sheep. He wasn’t as physically impressive as his seven older brothers. On the day Samuel came to choose a new king for Israel, it didn’t seem worthwhile to include David among the possible candidates, so he was left out in the fields with the sheep. Looking at David, you might not have guessed that he would have the faith and courage to defeat a giant and become Israel’s most successful king.\n\nBut the Lord sees past our labels, our physical appearance, our insecurities. He looks, instead, “on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7). And even when our heart isn’t quite right, if we’re willing, He will give us “another heart” (1 Samuel 10:9).",

So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 7And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilahuntilthou comest toShur, thatisover against Egypt. 8And he tookAgagthe king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 9But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and allthat wasgood, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thingthat wasvile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. 10Â¶Then came the word of theLordunto Samuel, saying, 11Itrepentethme that I have set up Saulto beking: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto theLordall night. 12And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. 13And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessedbethou of theLord: I have performed the commandment of theLord. 14And Samuel said, Whatmeaneththen this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? 15And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto theLordthy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. 16Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what theLordhath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on. 17And Samuel said, When thouwastlittle in thine own sight,wastthou notmadethe head of the tribes of Israel, and theLordanointedthee king over Israel? 18And theLordsent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. 19Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of theLord, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of theLord? 20And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea,I have obeyed the voice of theLord, and have gone the way which theLordsent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. 21But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto theLordthy God in Gilgal. 22And Samuel said, Hath theLordas greatdelightin burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying thevoiceof theLord? Behold, toobeyisbetter thansacrifice,andto hearken than the fat oframs. 23Forrebellionis asthe sin of witchcraft, andstubbornnessis asiniquity and idolatry.
