    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\n“July 6–12. ‘There Is a Prophet in Israel’: 2 Kings 2–7,”Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026(2026)\n\n“July 6–12. ‘There Is a Prophet in Israel,’”Come, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\n\nA prophet’s main mission is to teach and testify of the Savior Jesus Christ. Our record of the prophet Elisha, however, doesn’t include much of his teaching or testifying. What the record does include is the miracles Elisha performed, including raising a child from the dead (see2 Kings 4:18–37), feeding a multitude with just a little food (see2 Kings 4:42–44), and healing a leper (see2 Kings 5:1–14). So while we don’t have Elisha’s words about Christ, we do have Elisha’s ministry and miracles, which do testify of Christ. They are powerful manifestations of the Lord’s life-giving, nourishing, and healing power. Miracles happen more often in our lives than we sometimes realize. To see them, we need to seek the faith Elisha had when he prayed on behalf of his fearful young servant: “Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see” (2 Kings 6:17).\n\nFor more information about 2 Kings, see “Kings, books of” in the Bible Dictionary.",

But most importantly, miracles can turn us to the Lord. As you read2 Kings 2–6, consider listing the miracles you find, and ponder the spiritual lessons you learn from each one.\n\nYou might also compare the miracles Elisha performed with miracles that Jesus Christ performed (see2 Kings 4:8–37andLuke 7:11–16;2 Kings 4:42–44andJohn 6:1–13;2 Kings 5:1–15andLuke 17:11–19).

Rasband said: “We may or may not have chariots of fire sent to dispel our fears and conquer our demons, but the lesson is clear. The Lord is with us, mindful of us and blessing us in ways only He can do. Prayer can call down the strength and the revelation that we need to center our thoughts on Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice. The Lord knew that at times we would feel fear. I have been there and so have you. … In this Church we may be few in number by the way the world counts influence, but when we open our spiritual eyes, ‘they that be with us are more than they that be with them’ [2 Kings 6:16]” (“Be Not Troubled,”EnsignorLiahona, Nov. 2018, 18, 19).

And they two went on. 7And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. 8And Elijah took hismantle, and wrappedittogether, and smote thewaters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. 9Â¶And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let adoubleportion of thy spirit be upon me. 10And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing:nevertheless,if thou see mewhen I amtaken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not beso. 11And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold,there appearedachariotof fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; andElijahwent up by awhirlwindinto heaven. 12Â¶And Elisha sawit,and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. 13He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; 14And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, WhereistheLordGod of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, theypartedhither and thither: and Elisha went over. 15And when the sons of the prophets whichwereto view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit ofElijahdothreston Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. 16Â¶And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure theSpiritof theLordhath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send. 17And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. 18And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not? 19Â¶And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this cityispleasant, as my lord seeth: but the waterisnaught, and the ground barren. 20And he said, Bring me a newcruse, and put salt therein. And they broughtitto him. 21And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast thesaltin there, and said, Thus saith theLord, I have healed thesewaters; there shall not be from thence any more death orbarrenland. 22So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake. 23Â¶And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forthlittle childrenout of the city, andmockedhim, and said unto him, Go up, thoubaldhead; go up, thou bald head. 24And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of theLord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them. 25And he went from thence to mountCarmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria."

They know that webehungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city. 13And one of his servantsanswered and said, Letsometake, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, theyareas all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold,I say,theyareeven as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see. 14They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see. 15And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the waywasfull of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king. 16And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour wassoldfor a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of theLord. 17Â¶And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him. 18And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria: 19And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold,iftheLordshould make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. 20And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died."
