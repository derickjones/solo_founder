    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\n“June 22–26. ‘Hear Thou in Heaven Their Prayer’: 2 Samuel 11–12; 1 Kings 3; 6–9; 11,”Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026(2026)\n\n“June 22–26. ‘Hear Thou in Heaven Their Prayer,’”Come, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\n\nSolomon Dedicates the Temple at Jerusalem, by James Tissot and others\n\nSaul, David, and Solomon, the first three kings of Israel, all started out with so much promise. Humble, courageous, and wise, they each found favor with the Lord—at least at first. Sadly, each king also gave in to human weaknesses and temptation. They put their own desires before the Lord’s. And as we’ve seen over and over in the scriptures—and in our own lives—that led to tragedy.\n\nBut something important happened during the reign of Solomon that provided some hope for stability in the lives of the covenant people. Solomon built a temple. It was to be a more permanent house of the Lord than the tabernacle had been. And it would represent a more permanent presence of the Lord among His people. Solomon knew that the people would continue to face weakness and trials of various kinds. In dedicating the new holy house, Solomon pleaded with the Lord, “If they … return unto thee with all their heart, … then hear thou their prayer” (1 Kings 8:47–48). That’s part of what temple covenants do for us—they create a connection to God. They secure for us the promise that through our repentance and His mercy, He can “dwell among [us]” and never forsake us (1 Kings 6:13).\n\nFor an overview of the book of 1 Kings, see “Kings, books of” in the Bible Dictionary.",

then will I perform mywordwith thee, which I spake unto David thy father: 13And I willdwellamong the children of Israel, and will notforsakemy people Israel. 14So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 15And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling:andhe coveredthemon the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir. 16And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even builtthemfor it within,evenfor theoracle,evenfor the mostholyplace. 17And the house, thatis,the temple before it, was forty cubitslong. 18And the cedar of the house withinwascarved with knops and open flowers: allwascedar; there was no stone seen. 19And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of theLord. 20And the oracle in the forepartwastwenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; andsocovered the altarwhich was ofcedar. 21So Solomon overlaid the house within with puregold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. 22And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the wholealtarthatwasby the oracle heoverlaidwith gold. 23Â¶And within the oracle hemadetwocherubimsofolive tree,eachten cubits high. 24And five cubitswasthe one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the otherwereten cubits. 25And the other cherubwasten cubits: both the cherubimswereof one measure and one size. 26The height of the one cherubwasten cubits, and sowas itof the other cherub. 27And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of thecherubims, so that the wing of the one touched theonewall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. 28And he overlaid the cherubims with gold. 29And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures ofcherubimsand palm trees and open flowers, within and without. 30And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. 31Â¶And for the entering of the oracle he madedoorsofolive tree: the lintelandside postswerea fifth partof the wall. 32The two doors alsowere ofolive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaidthemwith gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees. 33So also made he for the door of the temple postsofolive tree, a fourth partof the wall. 34And the two doorswere offir tree: the two leaves of the one doorwerefolding, and the two leaves of the other doorwerefolding. 35And he carvedthereoncherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and coveredthemwith gold fitted upon the carved work. 36Â¶And he built the innercourtwith three rows ofhewedstone, and a row of cedar beams. 37Â¶In thefourthyear was the foundation of the house of theLordlaid, in the month Zif: 38And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, whichisthe eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it."

but I choseDavidto be over my people Israel. 17And it was in the heart of David my father to build anhousefor the name of theLordGod of Israel. 18And theLordsaid unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build anhouseunto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart. 19Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thysonthat shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name. 20And theLordhath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as theLordpromised, and have built an house for the name of theLordGod of Israel. 21And I have set there a place for the ark, whereinisthecovenantof theLord, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. 22Â¶And Solomon stood before the altar of theLordin the presence of all the congregation of Israel, andspreadforth his hands toward heaven: 23And he said,LordGodof Israel,there isnoGodlike thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, whokeepestcovenant and mercy with thy servants thatwalkbefore thee with all their heart: 24Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilleditwith thine hand, asit isthis day. 25Therefore now,LordGod of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel;so that thychildren take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me. 26And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. 27But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven andheavenof heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded? 28Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, OLordmy God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day: 29That thine eyes may be open toward thishousenight and day,eventoward theplaceof which thou hast said, Mynameshall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto theprayerwhich thy servant shall make toward this place. 30And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive. 31Â¶If any man trespass against his neighbour, andanoath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house: 32Then hear thou in heaven, anddo, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to hisrighteousness. 33Â¶When thy people Israel besmittendown before the enemy, because they havesinnedagainst thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house: 34Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers. 35Â¶When heaven isshut up, and there is norain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 36Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thouteachthem the good way wherein they shouldwalk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. 37Â¶If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust,orif there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them intheland of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoeversicknessthere be; 38What prayer and supplication soever bemadeby any man,orby all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: 39Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou,eventhou only, knowest theheartsof all the children of men;) 40That they mayfearthee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. 41Moreover concerning astranger, thatisnot of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a farcountryfor thy nameâs sake;

So the king and all the children of Israeldedicatedthe house of theLord. 64The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court thatwasbefore the house of theLord: forthere he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because thebrasen altarthatwasbefore theLordwastoo little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings. 65And at that time Solomon held afeast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from theentering inof Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before theLordour God, seven days and seven days,evenfourteen days. 66On theeighthday he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that theLordhad done for David his servant, and for Israel his people."

      "full_text": "1But kingSolomonloved manystrangewomen, together with thedaughterofPharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians,andHittites; 2Of the nationsconcerningwhich theLordsaid unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you:forsurely they willturn awayyour heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love. 3And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and hiswivesturned away his heart. 4For it came to pass, when Solomon was old,thathiswivesturned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with theLordhis God,aswasthe heartof David his father. 5For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 6AndSolomondid evil in the sight of theLord,andwent not fully after theLord, asdidDavid his father. 7Then did Solomon build an high place forChemosh, the abomination of Moab, in thehillthatisbefore Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. 8And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods. 9Â¶And theLordwas angry with Solomon, because his heart wasturnedfrom theLordGod of Israel, which hadappearedunto him twice, 10And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go afterothergods: but he kept not that which theLordcommanded. 11Wherefore theLordsaid unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is doneof thee, and thou hast not kept mycovenantand my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend thekingdomfrom thee, and will give it to thy servant. 12Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy fatherâs sake:butI will rend it out of the hand of thy son. 13Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom;butwill giveonetribe to thy son for David my servantâs sake, and for Jerusalemâs sake which I have chosen. 14Â¶And theLordstirred up anadversaryunto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: hewasof the kingâs seed in Edom. 15For it came to pass, when David was inEdom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom; 16(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:) 17That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his fatherâs servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadadbeingyet a little child. 18And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. 19And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 20And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaohâs house: and Genubath was in Pharaohâs household among the sons of Pharaoh. 21And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country. 22Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise. 23Â¶And God stirred him upanotheradversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 24And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew themof Zobah:and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus. 25And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadaddid:and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria. 26Â¶And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomonâs servant, whose motherâs namewasZeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted uphishand against the king. 27And thiswasthe cause that he lifted uphishand against the king: Solomon builtMillo,andrepaired the breaches of the city of David his father. 28And the man Jeroboamwasa mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph. 29And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophetAhijahthe Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they twowerealone in the field: 30AndAhijahcaught the new garment thatwason him, and rent itintwelve pieces: 31And he said to Jeroboam, Takethee ten pieces: for thus saith theLord, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will giveten tribesto thee: 32(But he shall haveone tribefor my servant Davidâs sake, and for Jerusalemâs sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:) 33Because that they haveforsakenme, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, andMilcomthe god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to dothat which isright in mine eyes, andto keepmy statutes and my judgments,asdidDavid his father. 34Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servantâs sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: 35But I will take the kingdom out of his sonâs hand, and will give it unto thee,eventen tribes. 36And unto his son will I giveonetribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I havechosenme to put my name there. 37And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy souldesireth, and shalt be king over Israel. 38And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wiltwalkin my ways, and dothat isright in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servantdid; that I will be with thee, and build thee a surehouse, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee. 39AndI will for this afflict the seed ofDavid, but not for ever. 40Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, untoShishakking of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. 41Â¶And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom,arethey not written in thebookof the acts of Solomon? 42And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israelwasforty years. 43And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: andRehoboamhis son reigned in his stead."
