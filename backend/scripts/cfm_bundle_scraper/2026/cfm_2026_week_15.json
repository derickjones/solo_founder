Barrett\n\nApril 6–12: “Remember This Day, in Which Ye Came Out from Egypt”\n\nPlague after plague afflicted Egypt, but Pharaoh still refused to release the Israelites. And yet God continued to demonstrate His power and give Pharaoh opportunities to accept “that I am the Lord” and “there is none like me in all the earth” (Exodus 7:5;9:14). Meanwhile, Moses and the Israelites must have watched with awe at these manifestations of God’s power on their behalf. Surely these continued signs confirmed their faith in God and strengthened their willingness to follow God’s prophet. Then, after nine terrible plagues had failed to free the Israelites, it was the tenth plague—the death of the firstborn, including Pharaoh’s firstborn—that finally ended the captivity. This seems fitting because in every case of spiritual captivity, there truly is only one way to escape. It is only the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Firstborn—the blood of the Lamb without blemish—that will save us.",

And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. 7And Pharaohâs servants said unto him, How long shall this man be asnareunto us? let the men go, that they may serve theLordtheir God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt isdestroyed? 8And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve theLordyour God:butwhoarethey that shall go? 9And Moses said, We will go with our young and with ourold, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for wemust holdafeastunto theLord. 10And he said unto them, Let theLordbe so with you,asI will let you go, and your little ones: lookto it;forevilisbefore you. 11Not so: go now yethat aremen, and serve theLord; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaohâs presence. 12Â¶And theLordsaid unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land,evenall that the hail hath left. 13And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and theLordbrought an east wind upon the land all that day, and allthatnight;andwhen it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 14And thelocustswent up over all the land of Egypt, and restedin all the coastsof Egypt: very grievouswere they;before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. 15For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 16Â¶Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against theLordyour God, and against you. 17Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat theLordyour God, that he may take away from me this death only. 18And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated theLord. 19And theLordturned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into theRed sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. 20ButtheLordhardened Pharaohâs heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go. 21Â¶And theLordsaid untoMoses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may bedarknessover the land of Egypt, even darknesswhichmay befelt. 22And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thickdarknessin all the land of Egypt three days: 23They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. 24Â¶And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve theLord; only let your flocks and your herdsbe stayed: let your little ones also go with you. 25And Moses said, Thou mustgive us alsosacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto theLordour God. 26Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve theLordour God; and we know not with what we must serve theLord, until we come thither. 27Â¶ButtheLordhardened Pharaohâs heart, and he would not let them go. 28And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for inthatday thou seest my face thou shalt die. 29And Moses said,Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more."
