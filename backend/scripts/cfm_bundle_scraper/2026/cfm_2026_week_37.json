    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\nProverbs 1–4; 15–16; 22; 31; Ecclesiastes 1–3; 11–12\n\n“September 7–13. ‘He Shall Direct Thy Paths’: Proverbs 1–4; 15–16; 22; 31; Ecclesiastes 1–3; 11–12,”Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026(2026)\n\n“September 7–13. ‘He Shall Direct Thy Paths,’”Come, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\n\nYou might think of the book of Proverbs as a collection of wise counsel from loving parents (seeProverbs 1:8). Its main message is that if you seek wisdom—especially God’s wisdom—life will go well. But Proverbs is followed by the book of Ecclesiastes, which seems to say, “It’s not that simple.” The Preacher quoted in Ecclesiastes observed that he “gave [his] heart to know wisdom” but still found “vexation of spirit” and “much grief” (Ecclesiastes 1:17–18). In various ways, the book asks, “Can there be real meaning in a world where everything seems vain, temporary, and uncertain?”\n\nAnd yet, while the two books look at life from different perspectives, they teach similar truths. Ecclesiastes declares: “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man” (Ecclesiastes 12:13). This is the same principle found throughout Proverbs: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart” (Proverbs 3:5; see alsoverse 7). Life is always better—if not always perfect—when we trust and follow the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nFor an overview of these books, see “Proverbs, book of” and “Ecclesiastes” in the Bible Dictionary.",

How do these chapters affect the way you think about wisdom? Based on what you find, how would you describe the wisdom that “the Lord giveth”? (Proverbs 2:6).
