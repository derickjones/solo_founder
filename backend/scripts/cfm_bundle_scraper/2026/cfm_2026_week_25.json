    "introduction": "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n\n“June 15–21. ‘The Battle Is the Lord’s’: 1 Samuel 17–18; 24–26; 2 Samuel 5–7,”Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026(2026)\n\n“June 15–21. ‘The Battle Is the Lord’s,’”Come, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\n\nEver since the tribes of Israel had settled in the promised land, the Philistines had been an ongoing threat to their safety. The Lord had delivered them many times in the past, but now the elders of Israel demanded, “We will have a king … [to] go out before us, and fight our battles” (1 Samuel 8:19–20). So Saul was anointed king. And yet when the menacing giant Goliath hurled his challenge to the armies of Israel, Saul—like the rest of his army—was “greatly afraid” (1 Samuel 17:11). On that day, it wasn’t King Saul who saved Israel but a humble shepherd boy named David, who was wearing no armor but was clothed with impenetrable faith in the Lord. This battle proved to Israel, and to anyone who has spiritual battles to fight, that “the Lord saveth not with sword and spear” and that “the battle is the Lord’s” (1 Samuel 17:47).",

I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. 29And David said, What have I now done?Is therenot a cause? 30Â¶And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner. 31And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsedthembefore Saul: and he sent for him. 32Â¶And David said to Saul, Let no manâs heart fail because of him; thy servantwillgo andfightwith this Philistine. 33And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thouart butayouth, and he a man of war from his youth. 34And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his fatherâs sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: 35And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivereditout of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caughthimby his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 36Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. 37David said moreover, TheLordthatdeliveredme out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he willdeliverme out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and theLordbe with thee. 38Â¶And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet ofbrass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. 39And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not provedit.And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not provedthem.And David put them off him. 40And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherdâs bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his slingwasin his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine. 41And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shieldwentbefore him. 42And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he wasbuta youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. 43And the Philistine said unto David,AmI adog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 44And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. 45Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in thenameof theLordof hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. 46This day will theLorddeliverthee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth mayknowthat there is a God in Israel. 47And all this assembly shall know that theLordsaveth not with sword and spear: for thebattleistheLordâs, and he will give you into our hands. 48And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. 49And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slangit,and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth. 50So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; butthere wasno sword in the hand of David. 51Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. 52And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. 53And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. 54And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. 55Â¶And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host,Abner, whose sonisthis youth? And Abner said,Asthy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell. 56And the king said, Inquire thou whose son thestriplingis. 57And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 58And Saul said to him, Whose sonartthou,thouyoung man? And David answered,I amthe son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite."

And David built round about fromMilloand inward. 10And David went on, and grew great, and theLordGod of hostswaswith him. 11Â¶AndHiramking of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house. 12And David perceived that theLordhad established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israelâs sake. 13Â¶And David tookhimmore concubines andwivesout of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yetsonsand daughters born to David. 14And thesebethe names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, 15Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 16And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet. 17Â¶But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heardof it,and went down to thehold. 18The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 19And David inquired of theLord, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And theLordsaid unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 20And David came toBaal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, TheLordhath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as thebreachof waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim. 21And there they left theirimages, and David and his menburned them. 22Â¶And thePhilistinescame up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 23And when David inquired of theLord, he said, Thou shalt not go up;butfetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. 24And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall theLordgo out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines. 25And David did so, as theLordhad commanded him; and smote thePhilistinesfrom Geba until thou come to Gazer."
