## 3. WEEK 2 BUNDLE CONTEXT (Input Data)

**Week**: 2  
**Date Range**: January 5–11  
**Title**: Moses 1; Abraham 3  
**Theme**: "This Is My Work and My Glory"

### CFM Lesson Introduction

The Bible begins with the words "in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Genesis 1:1). But what was there before this "beginning"? And why did God create all of this? Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord has shed light on these questions.

For example, He gave us the record of a vision in which Abraham saw our existence as spirits "before the world was" (see Abraham 3:22–28). The Lord also gave us an inspired translation or revision of the first six chapters of Genesis, called the book of Moses—which doesn't begin with "in the beginning." Instead, it begins with an experience Moses had that provides some context for the Creation story. Together, these latter-day scriptures are a good place to start our study of the Old Testament because they address some fundamental questions that can frame our reading: Who is God? Who are we? What is God's work, and what is our place in it? The opening chapters of Genesis could be seen as the Lord's response to Moses's request: "Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens" (Moses 1:36).

## 4. API RESPONSES (Current Output)

### ESSENTIAL Level Response (1,048 words)

Good morning, friends! Picture this: You're high on a rugged mountain, the wind whispering through ancient rocks, and suddenly, you're face-to-face with God Himself. No filters, no veil—just pure glory. What do you think He'd say first? Not "Fix your hair, Moses," though that might cross your mind! No, He starts with words that echo through eternity: "Behold, thou art my son" (Moses 1:4). Welcome to our Come, Follow Me study for January 5–11, diving into Moses 1 and Abraham 3. These revelations, given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, aren't just backstory to Genesis—they're God's loving answers to our deepest questions: Who is God? Who are we? What's our place in His grand plan? Let's walk through these visions together, like we're chatting over cocoa after a long day of scripture digging.

First, Moses's mountaintop encounter. Joseph Smith received this vision in December 1830, right in the thick of translating the Bible by inspiration. Moses is caught up to "an exceedingly high mountain" (Moses 1:1), sees God face-to-face, and that glory transforms him—he can endure it (Moses 1:2, 11). God declares, "I am the Lord God Almighty, and Endless is my name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless?" (Moses 1:3–4). Then the knockout punch: "Thou art my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands; but not all, for my works are without end" (Moses 1:4). And verse 6? "I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is full of grace and truth."

Why does this matter? President Russell M. Nelson taught, "If the Lord were speaking to you directly, the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity" ("Choices for Eternity," worldwide devotional for young adults, May 2022). Your identity as a child of God trumps every other label—it's why Satan jumps in right after, when Moses is alone and recovering. Satan slinks up like a shady salesman: "Moses, son of man, worship me" (Moses 1:12). Moses fires back, "Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?" (Moses 1:13). No glory? No dice! Satan has no light, just darkness (Moses 1:15). He even tries faking it: "I am the Only Begotten, worship me" (Moses 1:19). But Moses, remembering God's words from the burning bush, calls on the Only Begotten's name and commands, "Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship" (Moses 1:20–21). Satan trembles, the earth shakes, and poof—he's gone (Moses 1:22).

Here's the gentle nudge with a wink: Even after seeing God, temptation hits hard and fast. It's like spiritual whiplash! But Moses shows us how to resist: Know your divine worth, spot Satan's counterfeits—they're like fake plants that don't grow or baby dolls that don't breathe—and call on God for strength (Moses 1:13–18, 20–26). The Holy Ghost fills Moses, confirming, "Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty, have chosen thee" (Moses 1:25). We can do the same. Next time doubt creeps in, whisper, "I am a son/daughter of God," and watch the darkness flee.

Energized, Moses beholds the earth and its inhabitants—"numberless as the sand upon the sea shore" (Moses 1:28). He sees worlds without number, created by the Only Begotten (Moses 1:33). Puzzled, he asks, "Tell me … why these things are so" (Moses 1:30). God's profound answer? "For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Immortality through Christ's Resurrection, eternal life through His Atonement and our faithfulness. It's personal—God's grand purpose is you and me thriving forever.

Now, shift scenes to Abraham in ancient Ur of the Chaldees—think bustling Mesopotamia, ziggurats rising like stairways to the stars, around 2000 B.C. The Lord gives him a Urim and Thummim, those sacred seer stones (Abraham 3:1). Abraham gazes at the heavens: stars governed by Kolob, nearest the throne of God, where one revolution equals a thousand years on earth (Abraham 3:2–4). It's cosmic astronomy meets divine math—fascinating, right? God teaches order: planets above in time reckoning, building to Kolob (Abraham 3:9). Then the heart-stopper: Abraham sees "intelligences that were organized before the world was," many "noble and great ones." God says, "Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born" (Abraham 3:22–23).

We flash to the premortal council. One like God—Jehovah, our Savior—declares, "We will go down, … and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:24–25). Keep your first estate, get added upon; keep your second estate on earth, glory forever (Abraham 3:26). The call goes out: "Whom shall I send?" Jesus volunteers first: "Here am I, send me." Lucifer pipes up second, gets angry, loses his first estate—and drags others with him (Abraham 3:27–28). This is our backstory, friends! We chose to come, to prove ourselves, with Jesus leading the charge.

Tying it to today: Like Moses and Abraham, we have divine destinies. Satan confuses identities, but God clarifies: You're His child, with work to do (Moses 1:6; Doctrine and Covenants 11:20). Families, try this at dinner: Mirror time! Look in and say, "I am a child of God" (Moses 1:4), then tell each other. Kids, act out resisting Satan—pray, walk away, yell "Depart!" (Moses 1:12–26). Sing "I Am a Child of God" or "I Will Follow God's Plan." Ponder premortal truths from Abraham 3:22–28—spirits before the world, proving ourselves here. How does knowing you were chosen change your choices? President Nelson nailed it: "The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make" ("Choices for Eternity").

In Moses 1:39, we see the heartbeat: God's work is our eternal life. These visions frame the Old Testament—before "in the beginning," there was purpose, identity, and a plan centered on Christ.

So here's your simple invitation: This week, list three choices shaped by your divine identity as God's child. Ponder it morning and night—watch how it lights your path.

I bear testimony that these truths are real; I've felt God's voice affirming my worth through His Spirit, just as He did for Moses and Abraham. He knows you eternally.

Next week, we marvel at the Creation in Moses 2–5 and Genesis 1–2. Keep studying—see you there!

**Come, Follow Me 2026: Week 2 – Moses 1; Abraham 3 – "Before the Beginning"**

*(Warm, inviting tone, like settling into a cozy classroom at BYU. Soft chuckle to start.)*

Have you ever stared at the stars on a clear night and wondered, "What was *there* before the stars? Before the earth? Before *me*?" The Bible kicks off with "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Genesis 1:1). Punchy, right? But the Pearl of Great Price pulls back the curtain. Through visions to Moses and Abraham—revealed to Joseph Smith in the 1830s—Moses 1 and Abraham 3 don't start at the "beginning." They start *before* it. They answer: Who is God? Who are *we*? What's His grand work, and where do *you* fit in? *(Pause for emphasis.)* Let's dive in together, like Moses on that unnamed high mountain (Moses 1:1, 42) or Abraham peering through the Urim and Thummim in ancient Ur of the Chaldees (Abraham 3:1). These aren't just visions; they're blueprints for your eternal story.

We'll unfold four connected principles—divine identity, resisting the adversary, God's work and glory, and our premortal roots—watching patterns emerge across prophets, eras, and even into our lives today. Grab your scriptures; let's make them come alive.

**Principle 1: As a child of God, you have a divine destiny.**

Picture Moses, transfigured by God's glory, beholding Him face to face: "Behold, I am the Lord God Almighty, and Endless is my name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless?" (Moses 1:3). Then the tender pivot: "And, behold, thou art my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands; but not all, for my works are without end" (Moses 1:4). God doesn't lead with commandments—He leads with *identity*. Moses is His "son," in the "similitude of mine Only Begotten" (Moses 1:6), with "a work" prepared just for him.

Fast-forward to Abraham in Ur, that cradle of Chaldean astronomy around 2000 B.C., where star-gazers mapped heavens with clay tablets. God hands him the Urim and Thummim—not some foggy crystal ball, but a divine lens revealing cosmic order: stars like Kolob nearest God's throne, governing in hierarchies of time (Abraham 3:2–4, 9). Amid this, God declares Abraham "one of them"—a "noble and great one" chosen before birth (Abraham 3:22–23). Pattern alert: Both prophets see vast creations, yet God zooms in: *You* matter. You're no cosmic accident.

President Russell M. Nelson echoes this: "If the Lord were speaking to you directly, the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity" ("Choices for Eternity," worldwide devotional for young adults, May 2022). Satan flips the script, hissing to Moses, "Moses, son of man, worship me" (Moses 1:12)—demoting him from son to mere mortal. Spot the counterfeit: God affirms divine sonship; Satan sows doubt. As President Nelson adds, "The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make."

Today? Scroll social media, and labels scream louder than lineage. But list choices flowing from "child of God"—forgiving a friend, serving quietly—and watch your destiny unfold. Like kids peering in mirrors, declaring "I am a child of God" (CFM Teaching Children), or singing "I Am a Child of God" (Hymns, no. 301). It's not fluffy; it's foundational.

**Principle 2: With the Lord's help, you can resist Satan.**

No sooner does God's glory lift than Moses crashes: "Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing" (Moses 1:10). Enter Satan, stage left, with his loud rant: "Moses, son of man, worship me" (Moses 1:12). Moses doesn't flinch. "Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God... and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?" (Moses 1:13). Boom—identity as armor. He invokes the burning bush command: "Call upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten" (Moses 1:17; see Exodus 3). Satan weeps, wails, gnashes—poof, gone (Moses 1:19–22).

Historical nod: This echoes Christ's wilderness showdown (Matthew 4:1–11), where Satan tempts with bread, power, glory—counterfeits every time. Elder Gary E. Stevenson warns of modern fakes: "Deceive Me Not" (Liahona, Nov. 2019). Think fake plants versus living ones—no roots, no growth. Satan peddles artificial power: "I am the Only Begotten" (Moses 1:19). Moses rejects by Spirit, prayer, Christ's name—gaining strength "stronger than many waters" (Moses 1:25).

Gentle humor here: Satan's tantrum? Like a toddler mid-meltdown, commanding the earth to shake while Moses stands firm. For families, act it out—pray, walk away, call for help (CFM Teaching Children). Tempted by a screen binge or harsh word? Moses models: Fear creeps in (Moses 1:20), but "calling upon God, he received strength." The Holy Ghost bears record (Moses 1:24); you're never solo.

**Principle 3: God's work and glory is to help you gain eternal life.**

Energized, Moses beholds "worlds without number" created by the Only Begotten (Moses 1:27–33). Worlds pass, new ones rise—"no end to my works" (Moses 1:38). Why? "Tell me... why these things are so," Moses pleads (Moses 1:30). God's reply: "For mine own purpose have I made these things... For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:31, 39).

Abraham's vision layers on: Noble spirits council—"We will go down... and we will make an earth... we will prove them herewith" (Abraham 3:24–25). Christ volunteers first: "Here am I, send me" (Abraham 3:27). Immortality? Christ's victory over death for all. Eternal life? Exaltation through obedience, "glory added upon their heads for ever and ever" (Abraham 3:26; see Topics and Questions, "Eternal Life").

Pattern across time: Moses freed Israel from bondage (Moses 1:26); Abraham's seed multiplied like stars (Abraham 3:14). Today, amid endless scrolls and worries, God's purpose hasn't shifted. Your "work" (Moses 1:6; D&C 11:20)? Prove faithful in this second estate. Christ bridges both immortalities.

**Principle 4: You lived as a spirit before you were born on earth.**

Abraham 3:22–28 is premortal gold: "Intelligences that were organized before the world was... many of the noble and great ones." Eternal spirits—"gnolaum, or eternal" (Abraham 3:18)—varied in intelligence, God supreme (Abraham 3:19, 21). You? Among them, sent to "prove" obedience (Abraham 3:25). Lucifer's rebellion cost his first estate (Abraham 3:28).

Connect to Moses: Worlds for God's "purpose"—your progression (Moses 1:31). Like Old Testament types foreshadowing Christ, premortal council foreshadows mortality's test, fulfilled in His Atonement. Sing "I Will Follow God's Plan" (Children's Songbook, 164–65); draw your spirit self choosing earth.

Modern tie: Facing choices? Abraham 3:25 reminds: This proves your destiny. Wrong turn? Savior redeems (CFM Teaching Children).

**Weaving It Together: Your Eternal Story**

See the pattern? God reveals identity amid infinities (Moses 1:4; Abraham 3:23). Satan counterfeits (Moses 1:12,19). Resistance unlocks vision (Moses 1:24–25). All orbits God's glory: your eternal life (Moses 1:39). From Ur's star-maps to Missouri revelations, prophets testify: You're chosen for *this* earth, this moment.

I testify: These truths anchor me. Knowing I'm His son, crafted for His work, changes everything—from resisting daily tugs to embracing premortal promise.

**Three Invitations:**
1. Tonight, mirror-gaze like Moses: Declare your divine son- or daughtership (Moses 1:4,6). List three choices it shapes.
2. Family dinner: Act out Moses vs. Satan (Moses 1:13–22). Practice "In the name of the Only Begotten, depart!"
3. Ponder Abraham 3:22–28. Journal one premortal truth proving vital now—like choosing Christ daily (Abraham 3:27).

Next week: Moses 2–5; Genesis 1–2. See Creation's majesty unfold—how fitting after glimpsing the premortal plan.

Study deeply, live celestial. He lives; you're His.

*(Warm fade, with a smile in the voice.)*

**Come, Follow Me 2026: Week 2 – Moses 1; Abraham 3 – "Before the Beginning: Who We Are, Whose We Are, and Why We're Here"**

*Pause for warm, inviting tone.* Good morning, friends—or whenever you're tuning in. Imagine standing on a windswept peak, the air electric with heaven's presence, as the veil parts and eternity unfolds. What questions would burn in your soul? What was there *before* the "beginning" of Genesis 1:1? Why did God create *this* earth amid worlds without number? And crucially: Who is God? Who are *we*? What is His work, and what role do *you* play in it?

These are no idle curiosities—they frame our entire Old Testament journey. Through Joseph Smith's inspired translation of Genesis's opening chapters, now the book of Moses, and Abraham's visionary record, the Lord answers Moses's plea: "Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens" (Moses 1:36). Here, before Eden's gardens or Sinai's thunders, we glimpse premortal councils, cosmic reckonings, and the grand purpose of existence. Let's unfold these revelations layer by layer, as a master craftsman reveals the intricate beauty within a single verse. We'll explore seven eternal principles, drawing from Moses 1 and Abraham 3, with their historical echoes and doctrinal depths. Buckle up—eternity awaits.

**Principle 1: Your Divine Identity as a Child of God – The Foundation of Destiny**

Our study opens not with creation's fanfare, but with Moses "caught up into an exceedingly high mountain" (Moses 1:1)—a peak whose name "shall not be known among the children of men" (Moses 1:42), preserving its sanctity like a veiled temple summit. There, God speaks face to face: "Behold, I am the Lord God Almighty, and Endless is my name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless?" (Moses 1:3). Then, the thunderbolt: "And, behold, thou art my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands; but not all, for my works are without end, and also my words, for they never cease" (Moses 1:4).

Pause there. God doesn't launch into cosmology; He declares identity first. President Russell M. Nelson echoes this: "If the Lord were speaking to you directly, the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity" ("Choices for Eternity" [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 2022]). Satan knows this too—note the pattern. God says, "thou art my son" (Moses 1:4, 6); Satan sneers, "Moses, son of man, worship me" (Moses 1:12), stripping divine sonship to mere mortality. It's a counterfeit from the start.

Historically, Moses's transfiguration—"the glory of God was upon Moses; therefore Moses could endure his presence" (Moses 1:2)—mirrors ancient prophetic calls, but Joseph Smith's restoration clarifies what Genesis obscured. As children, try this: gaze in a mirror after reading Moses 1:4 and affirm, "I am a child of God." Then tell a sibling or friend, "You are a child of God." Extend it to photos of strangers: "This is a child of God." Why? It transforms how we treat ourselves and others.

And the payoff? "The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make" (President Nelson, "Choices for Eternity"). List choices flowing from this: career paths, relationships, daily habits. Satan blurs labels—athlete, influencer, failure—but child of God precedes them all. I bear testimony: this truth anchors the soul amid life's tempests.

**Principle 2: Resisting Satan – From Fear to Strength Through the Savior**

No sooner does Moses behold God than "the presence of God withdrew from Moses... and Moses was left unto himself. And as he was left unto himself, he fell unto the earth" (Moses 1:9). Hours pass; he realizes "man is nothing" (Moses 1:10). Enter Satan: "Moses, son of man, worship me" (Moses 1:12). Moses's riposte? "Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?" (Moses 1:13).

Here's doctrinal depth: Satan peddles counterfeits. God offers glory that transfigures (Moses 1:11, 14); Satan brings darkness—"it is darkness unto me" (Moses 1:15). Like spotting a fake plant (no roots, no growth) or a baby doll (no life, no breath), discern by invoking truth: "Worship God, for him only shalt thou serve" (Moses 1:15). Moses persists: "Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not" (Moses 1:16), recalling the burning bush command: "Call upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten" (Moses 1:17).

Fear creeps in—"Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell" (Moses 1:20)—but prayer rebounds: "In the name of the Only Begotten, depart hence, Satan" (Moses 1:21). Satan trembles, wails, and flees (Moses 1:22). Lesson? Spiritual highs don't exempt temptation; Satan doubts them. Act it out with kids: pray, walk away, seek help—like little Moseses conquering a cartoon adversary. (And gently humorous aside: Satan's "loud voice, with weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth" (Moses 1:22)? Sounds like a toddler denied a second cookie—powerless bluster.)

The Lord seals it: "Blessed art thou, Moses, for I... have chosen thee, and thou shalt be made stronger than many waters" (Moses 1:25). Cross-reference Matthew 4:1–11—same pattern. With Christ's help, we resist (see Gary E. Stevenson, "Deceive Me Not," Liahona, Nov. 2019).

**Principle 3: God's Work and Glory – Immortality and Eternal Life for *You***

Refreshed, Moses beholds "the earth, yea, even all of it... discerning it by the Spirit of God" (Moses 1:27–28). Worlds multiply: "each land was called earth, and there were inhabitants on the face thereof" (Moses 1:29). Worlds without number, created by the Son (Moses 1:32–33). Moses asks, "Tell me... why these things are so?" (Moses 1:30).

The pinnacle: "For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Immortality is resurrection's gift through Christ; eternal life is exaltation's fullness (see Topics and Questions, "Eternal Life"). God numbers all—"they are mine and I know them" (Moses 1:35)—yet His purpose centers *you*. Abraham 3:24–26 amplifies: noble spirits will "make an earth" to prove us.

Application? In trials, parenting chaos, or quiet doubts, remember: you're not cosmic debris; you're the workmanship advancing God's glory.

**Principle 4: Premortal Life – Spirits Organized Before the World Was**

Shift to Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees, armed with Urim and Thummim (Abraham 3:1)—ancient seer stones, like Joseph's spectacles, unveiling heavens. He sees stars: Kolob nearest God's throne, governing by "times and seasons" where "one revolution was a day unto the Lord... one thousand years according to the time... of the earth" (Abraham 3:4). Fun fact: Moon's reckoning outpaces earth's; layers ascend to Kolob (Abraham 3:5–9). It's cosmic order, mirroring spiritual hierarchies.

Abraham talks "face to face, as one man talketh with another" (Abraham 3:11). God reveals: "intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones" (Abraham 3:22). God declares: "Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born" (Abraham 3:23). We lived as spirits—eternal "gnolaum" intelligences (Abraham 3:18), varying in intelligence yet all endless.

Value? It dignifies choices. Sing "I Am a Child of God" (Hymns, no. 301) or "I Will Follow God's Plan" (Children's Songbook, 164–65). Draw premortal scenes. Eternal perspective crushes today's fads.

**Principle 5: The Plan Unfolds – Foreordination and Proving Our Estates**

Among intelligences, "one... like unto God" proposes: "We will go down... and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith" (Abraham 3:24–25). Keep your "first estate," gain glory; falter in the "second estate," lose it (Abraham 3:26). The Lord asks, "Whom shall I send?" One like the Son of Man volunteers first; another angrily dissents (Abraham 3:27–28).

Typology here: First estate = premortal faithfulness; second = mortal probation. Abraham, foreordained ruler, foreshadows us. God to Moses: "I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten" (Moses 1:6). Our work? "Look to the scriptures... they testify of me" (Doctrine and Covenants 11:20, as suggested). In meals or chores, share Moses's feats (Gospel Art Book, nos. 13–16).

Humorously: Proving like a cosmic job interview—do we follow the Boss's script?

**Principle 6: Christ's Central Role – Creator, Redeemer, Savior**

All pivots on the Only Begotten: Worlds by His word (Moses 1:32–33); Redeemer foreordained (Abraham 3:27). "Mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is full of grace and truth" (Moses 1:6). When we err in proving (Abraham 3:25), Christ redeems—granting repentance, as youth ponder in For the Strength of Youth.

**Principle 7: Modern Witnesses – Prophetic Ties to Ancient Truths**

Joseph fulfills prophecy: Words "esteemed as naught" restored through "another like unto thee" (Moses 1:41). Nelson urges: Read "Choices for Eternity" section "First: Know the truth about who you are." Videos like "Our True Identity" and "I Am a Son of God" vivify it. Liahona, For the Strength of Youth, Friend amplify for all ages.

In synthesis, these chapters answer Moses's query (Moses 1:36): Infinite heavens, numbered earths, purposeful creation—all for your immortality and eternal life through Christ. I testify: Organized before worlds, chosen like Abraham, proved like Moses, you are God's son or daughter. This Plan pulses with love; Satan can't rewrite it.

**Invitations and Preview**

This week: List identity-driven choices; act out resisting Satan at dinner; chart Abraham 3 truths; pray over Moses 1:39—how does it shape your "why"? Families, spontaneous moments: Mirror affirmations, premortal drawings, estate-keeping practices.

Next week advances to Creation's poetry—Genesis echoes, Pearl of Great Price lights—unfolding earth's making amid premortal promises. Study deeply; the heavens declare it. God bless you in this sacred pursuit.

*Warm closing pause.* Until next time, walk as children of endless light.
